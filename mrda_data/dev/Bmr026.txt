me013|yeah.|z
me011|okay we're on.|s
me011|so i think this is going to be a pretty short meeting because i have four agenda items.|s^t
me011|three of them were requested by jane who is not going to be at the meeting today.|s
me011|tsk.|b
me011|so the uh first was transcription status.|h|s^rt^t
me011|does anyone besides jane know what the transcription status is?|qy^rt
me018|um sort of i do peripherally.|fg|s
me018|um well first of all with i b m i got a note from brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago.|h|s
mn014|is that english?|qy^rt^t1
mn017|that's our system.|s
me011|ugh!|s^fe
me018|and that it's gone out to the transcribers.|s
me018|and hopefully next week we'll have the transcription back from that.|s
me018|um jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the icsi side.|h|s
me011|can i have a pen?|qy
me018|she's assigned i think probably five or six more meetings.|s
mn014|yeah i think we're up to m r thirteen or something.|s^e
me018|yeah so um i guess she's hired some new transcribers.|fg|s
mn017|huh.|b
me018|and|%-
me001|which meetings is she transcribing?|qw^rt
mn017|speaking|s^t1.%-
me018|um well we've we've run out of e d us because a certain number of them are um sort of awaiting to go to i b m.|h|s
me001|okay.|s^bk
mn014|for i b m yeah.|s^2
me001|okay.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me018|and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.|s
me001|so we're doing some in parallel.|s^bu
mn017|so does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from i b m?|qy^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
me018|no.|s^ar
me018|oh no no.|s^ar^r
me011|no no.|s^ar
me018|no.|s^ar^r
mn017|no?|qy^bu^d^r^rt
me018|we're not waiting on them.|s
me011|we haven't done that process.|s
me011|so they're doing the full transcription process.|s^e
mn017|oh.|s^bk
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|yeah.|b
me001|so they're just doing their own thing until|s^bu.%-
mn017|because i i need to ask jane whether it's it would be okay for her um some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the smartkom data collection which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.|s
me018|we're doing it in parallel yeah.|s^na
me001|okay.|s^bk
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|um and we want it you know we need|s.%--
mn017|the again we we have a similar uh logistic set up where we are supposed to send the data to munich.|s
mn017|and get it transcribed and get it back.|s
me011|right.|b
mn017|but to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started.|s
me011|yep sounds familiar.|s^ba
mn017|and so um i wanted to ask jane if if uh you know maybe one of their transcribers could could do|s.%--
mn017|i mean since these are very short that should really be uh|s.%-
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|um it's|%-
mn014|there's only two channels.|s
mn014|so it's only|%-
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|it's only two|s.%-
mn014|yeah.|fg
mn014|as the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed i think.|s
mn017|right|fg
mn014|so|fh
mn017|yeah.|fg
mn017|so so it's basically one channel to transcribe.|s
mn017|and it's|s.%--
mn017|one session is only uh like seven|s.%-
me013|so that should have many fewer|s.%--
me013|and it's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that.|s^e
mn017|right.|s^aa
mn017|and some of it is read speech so we could give them the the thing that they're reading.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and they just may|s.%-
me011|make sure it's right?|qy^2^d^rt
mn017|and so um|fh
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|um i guess since she's|fh|s.%--
mn017|i was going to ask her but since she's not around i maybe i'll|s.%-
me013|yeah well it certainly seems|fg|s.%-
mn017|uh if if that's okay with you to to you know get that stuff uh to ask her for that then i'll do that.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah if we're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that that's okay because i i um i mean i still have high hopes that the that the i b m pipeline will work out for us so it's|s.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|okay yeah.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|alrighty.|s^bk
me018|oh yeah and also related to the transcription stuff.|fg|s^tc
me018|so i've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date showing what the current status is of the of all the things we've collected.|s
me018|and what stage each meeting is in in terms of whether it's|s.%-
me011|can you mail that out to the list?|qy^rt
me018|uhhuh yeah i will.|s^aa^cc
me018|i|%--
me018|that's the thing that i sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages.|s
me018|and so that's where i'm putting it but i'll|s.%--
me011|oh okay okay.|s^bk
me018|i'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.|s^cc
me011|yeah i haven't done that.|s
me011|so i have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|i'll try to get to that.|s^cc
me011|okay.|s^bk^rt^tc
me011|so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval but i don't really think there's much to talk about.|s
me011|i'm just going to do it.|s^cc
me011|and uh if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.|s
me013|you are going to|qy^bu^d.%-
me011|i'm going to send out to the participants uh with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits.|s^cc
me011|and then bleep them out.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|for the ones that we have.|s
me011|um|fh
mn014|so but it's just transcripts not the not the audio?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|nope they'll have access to the audio also.|s^ar|s
mn014|okay yeah yep.|s^bk
mn014|uh|h
me011|i mean that's my intention.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|because the transcripts might not be right.|s
me018|so|fg
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|so you want people to be able to listen to them.|s
me018|so um the audio that they're going to have access to will that be the uncompressed version?|qy^d^rt
me018|or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and|qrr.%-
me011|oh that's a good point.|s^ba
me011|that's a good point.|s^ba^r
me011|yeah it's it's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because uh uh it takes too long to do random access decompression.|h|s
me018|huh.|b
me018|yeah i was just wondering because we're uh running out of the un backed up disk space on|s.%-
me011|well that was the other point.|s
me018|oh was that another one?|qy^bu
me011|yep that's another agenda item.|s^t
me018|okay.|s^bk
me018|i'll wait.|s^cc
me011|so uh|h
me011|but that is a good point so we'll get to that too.|s^ba
me011|um darpa demo status not much to say.|h|s
me011|the back end stuff is working out fine.|s
me011|it's more or less ready to go.|s
me011|i've added some stuff that uh indexes by the meeting type m r e d u et cetera.|s
me011|and also by the user i d.|s
me011|so that the front end can then do filtering based on that as well.|s
me011|uh the back end is uh going more slowly as i i think i said before just because i'm not much of a tcl t.k. programmer.|fh|s
me011|and uh dave gelbart says he's a little too busy.|fh|s
me011|so i think don and i are going to work on that and and you and i can just talk about it off line more.|s
me001|right.|b
me011|but uh the back end was pretty smooth.|fh|s
me013|oh.|fg
me011|so i think we'll have something.|s
me011|it may not be as as pretty as we might like but we'll have something.|s
me013|i wondered when we would reach dave's saturation point.|s
me013|he's sort of been been volunteering for everything.|s
me013|and and uh|%--
me011|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay!|s^fe^rt
me013|finally said he was too busy.|s
me013|i guess we reached it.|s
me011|yeah he he actually he volunteered but then he then he retracted it.|fg|s
me011|so|fh
me011|oh well.|s^bd
me011|um|fg
me001|and also um i was just showing andreas i got um an x waves kind of display.|fg|s^tc
me001|and i don't know how much more we can do with it.|s^no
me001|with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom.|s
me011|oh cool.|s^ba
me001|so right now it's just an x waves.|s
me001|and then you have three windows.|s
me001|but i don't know it looked pretty nice.|s
me001|and i'm sure it think it has potential for a little something.|s
me011|for a demo?|qy^d^rt
me001|yeah for a demo.|s^aa^r
me011|yeah sounds good.|s^bk
me001|so|fh
me013|okay so again the issue is for july the issue's going to be what can we fit into a windows machine uh and so on.|fg|s
me001|oh.|b
me013|but|fh
me001|okay.|s^bk
me011|so it might just be slides.|s
me001|yeah okay.|s^bk
me001|well we'll see um|s.%-
mn014|well yeah.|b
mn014|i've been putting together uh transcriber things for windows.|s
mn014|so|%--
mn014|and i installed it on dave gelbart's p c and it worked just fine.|s
mn014|so hopefully that will work.|s
mn017|really?|qy^bh
mn017|so is that|qy^rt.%--
mn017|because there's some people um|s.%--
mn017|it would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at at s r i.|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|because the um|s^df.%--
mn014|yep.|s^bk
mn017|we have we have more windows machines to run the|s.%--
me011|well transcriber is tcl t.k. very generic with snack.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|so basically anything you can get snack to run on it will work.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn014|yeah.|fg
mn014|yeah.|fg
mn014|but but the problem is the version transcriber works with the snack version is one point six whatever.|s
mn014|and that's not anymore supported.|s
mn014|it's not on on the web page anymore.|s
mn014|but i just wrote an email to to the author of to the snack author.|s
mn014|and he sent me to one point six whatever library.|s
mn014|and so it works.|s
me011|well i thought it was packaged with transcriber.|s^bu
mn014|yeah.|s^aap
mn014|but then you can't add our patches.|s^arp
mn014|and then the the new version is is totally different.|s
me011|oh.|s^bk
mn014|and in yeah in terms of of the source code.|s
mn014|you you can't find the tcl files anymore.|s
me011|uh.|b
mn014|it's some whatever wrapped thing.|s
mn017|huh.|b.%
mn014|and you can't you can't access that.|s^e
mn014|so you have to install first install tcl then install snack.|s
mn014|and then install the transcriber thing.|s
mn014|and then do the patches.|s
me011|patch.|s^2
mn017|i i wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along|s^cs.%-
me011|ugh!|s^fe
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|we have.|s
mn017|we have?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
me011|yeah it's just hasn't made it into the release yet.|s^aa|s
mn017|oh.|s^bk
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|so did you um put the uh the n t version out on the uh meeting recorder page or|qr^tc.%--
mn014|no i haven't done that yet.|s^ar
mn014|i'm|%--
mn014|oh nope.|s^ar
mn014|but i definitely will do that.|s^cc
me013|so can some of the stuff that don's talking about somehow fit into this?|qy^tc
me013|uh mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the|fh|s.%--
me001|yeah.|b
me001|yeah it's basically ascii files or binary files whatever representation.|s
mn014|so|fh
me001|just three different|s.%--
me001|it's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's|s.%--
me001|i mean we could do it in i mean you could do it in a number of different places i'm sure.|s
mn017|so so well|fg
mn017|but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time time synchronous with the waveform.|s^cs
mn014|yep.|b
me001|yeah.|b
me001|yeah that'd be very cool.|s^aa^ba
me013|yes.|b
me011|it'd be easy enough to add that.|s
me011|again it's it's it's more tcl t.k. programming.|s^ng
me001|yeah.|b
me011|so someone who's familiar with tcl t.k. has to do it.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|right.|b
me011|but uh it wouldn't be hard to do.|s
mn017|but it would almost be like having another waveform displayed.|s
me001|uhhuh.|b
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah maybe we could look into that.|s^cs
me001|yeah.|b
me011|but it it seems to me that i|s.%--
mn014|and|%-
me011|it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary.|s
me011|so it seems to me you could do images.|s
me001|um what do you mean by real time?|h|qw
me001|do you mean like|qy.%-
me018|like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.|s^bu^rt
me001|okay.|s^bk
me018|is that what you mean?|qy^rt
me011|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|b
me011|it just seems to me|s.%--
me001|it would be cool to see it.|s.x
me001|it would be cool like to see to hear it and see it.|s
mn014|and to hear it.|s^2
mn014|yeah.|b
me001|and see the pitch contours also.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|sure but i don't think i you can do all that just statically in powerpoint.|s^aap|s^nd
me001|i think it would lose|s.%-
me001|yeah i mean|s.%-
me011|just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that's|s.%-
me001|right right.|fg
me001|i just thought if you meant slides i thought you meant like just like um view graphs or something.|s^df
me013|you know|%--
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so uh|%--
me013|no we're talking about on the computer.|s
me001|right.|b
me013|and and um i think when we were talking about this before we had this little demo meeting.|fg|s
me013|we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have.|s
me013|and the more live the better but uh given the crunch of time we may have to retreat from it to some extent.|s
me013|so i think for a lot of reasons i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so it'd be a good thing to get in there.|s
me013|but|fh
me013|um anyway just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing uh in to people.|fh|s
me001|uhhuh.|b
me013|because a lot of this stuff particularly for communicator uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about originally had had to do with prosodics.|s
me013|it'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them.|s
me001|uhhuh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me011|and the last item on the agenda is disk issues yet again.|s^tc
me011|so we're doing okay on backed up.|s
me011|we're we're only about thirty per cent on the second disk.|s
me011|so uh we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical.|s
me011|but we are like ninety five per cent ninety eight per cent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|and my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space.|s^rt
me011|but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once in a lot of different ways.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|oh there's a lot of transcribers too.|s
me011|yeah there're a lot of transcribers.|s^bk|s^m
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|so all of those need to be expanded.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|and then people are doing chunking and i want to do uh uh uh the permission forms.|s^rt^t
me018|right.|b
me011|so i want those to be live so there's a lot of data that has to be around.|s
me011|um and jane was going to talk to uh dave johnson about it.|fh|s
me011|one of the things i was thinking is we we just got these hundred|s.%--
me011|all right excuse me.|s^fa
me011|ten uh sparc blade sun blades.|s
me013|did they come in?|qy^rt
me018|sun blades.|s^r
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|yeah.|b
me018|they came in the other day.|s
me011|they came in but they're not set up yet.|s^r
me013|oh.|s^bk
me011|and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they'll be in the machine room.|s^cs
me011|they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines.|s^e
me011|and if we just need un backed up space we could just hang disks off them.|s
me018|well is there|qy.%--
me018|why not just hang them off of abbott?|qw^cs^nd
me018|is there a|qy.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me011|because there's no more room in the disk racks on abbott.|s
me018|uh.|s^bk
me018|uh i see.|s^bk
me013|weren't we going to get|qy^bu.%--
me013|well maybe it should get another rack.|s^cs
mn017|but you still need to store the disks somehow.|s
me011|well but the sun blades have spare drive bays.|s
mn017|so|%-
me018|you can put two|s^cs.%--
me011|just put them in.|s^co
mn017|oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the|qy^bu^d^rt.%-
mn014|internal.|s
me011|sure.|b
mn014|yeah.|b.%
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|oh.|s^bk
me011|because the sun uh these sun blades take commodity hard drives.|s
me011|so you can just go out and buy a p c hard drive and stick it in.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|but if abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it uh a second disk rack or something.|s^cs
mn017|plus we're talking about buying a second uh file server.|s^e^rt
me011|well i mean there are lots of long term solutions.|s^ba
me011|what i'm looking for is where do we expand the next meeting?|qh
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|i see oh i see.|s^bk
me013|well for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten.|s
me013|mightn't you?|qy^g
me013|uh you know dave johnson is gone for like ten days.|fh|s^df^f
me011|oh i didn't know he had left already.|s^no
me013|uh well tonight.|h|s^bsc
me011|oh oh well.|s^by
mn017|you mean he won't set up the|qy^bu^d.%--
mn017|huh.|b
me001|how much space do you need for these?|qw^rt
me013|i don't know.|s^no
me013|i don't know what his schedule is.|s^no
me011|you we need about a gig per meeting.|s
me013|i'm just saying he's gone.|s
me018|i i|%-
mn014|yep.|b
me001|i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.|s
me011|all right!|s^ba^fe
me001|so|h
me011|what's your computer's name?|qw^rt
me001|uh samosa.|h|s^rt
me013|you had an eighteen gigabyte drive.|s^bc
me001|yeah i had.|s^aa
me001|well it's about i think there's about twelve gig left.|s
me011|so it and you have an x drives installed?|qy^bu^d^rt
me001|yeah.|s^aa
me011|okay.|s^bk
me001|so i didn't realize it was so critical.|fg|s
me011|and you're you're offering|qy^d.%-
me001|i mean i'm not doing anything on it right now until i get new meetings to or that are new transcriptions coming in i really can't do anything.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me018|i i i just gave thilo some about ten gigs the last ten gigs of space that there was on on uh abbott.|s
me001|um not that i can't do anything i|s.%-
me018|uh and uh|fh
me018|so but that but|s.%--
me011|which one was that?|qw
me011|x g?|qy^d^g^rt
mn014|x g.|s
me018|x g.|s^m
me011|okay.|s^bk
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|x g?|qw^bu^d^rt
mn017|that's also where we store the the uh hub five training set waveforms.|s^bu
mn014|oops.|s^fa
me018|no.|s^ar
mn017|right?|qy^d^g
me011|but that won't be getting any bigger.|s^bu
me018|i don't think that's on x g.|s
me011|will it?|qy^g
mn017|right.|s^aa
me018|on x g is only carmen and and stephane's disk.|s
mn014|it's|%
mn017|but i've also been storing i've been storing the feature files there.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|and i guess i can start deleting some because we now know what the best features are.|s
me001|well|fg
mn017|and we won't be using the old ones anymore.|s
me018|yeah i i don't think it was on x g.|s^r
me001|i have a lot of space though.|s
mn017|uh oh thats x.a. oh that's x|s.%--
mn014|isn't that x h?|qy^bu^rt
me018|i|%-
me001|i have a lot of space and it's not it's|s.%-
me011|not not for long.|s
me001|there's very little uh|s.%--
me001|yeah.|s^aa
me001|not for long.|s^m
me001|but i mean it's not going|s.%-
mn017|maybe i'm|s.%--
mn017|oh no i'm sorry.|s^fa
me001|it's not being used often at all.|s
mn014|but i'm using x h h too.|s
me011|yeah it's probably probably only about four gig is on x on your x drive.|s
mn014|so|s.%-
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|but we'll definitely take it up if you|s.%-
me001|i|%-
mn017|i think you're right.|s^na
me001|i think it's about four or five gig.|s
mn017|it's x h and d|s.%-
me001|because i have four meetings on there.|s
mn017|the|%-
mn017|i'm also using d g.|s
mn017|i got that confused.|s
me001|three or four meetings.|s
mn017|okay k.|s
me011|great.|s^ba^tc
me001|so|s.%--
me013|we need|s.%-
me011|okay so that will get us through the next couple days.|s^tc
me013|we need another gigaquad.|s^cs^j
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|at least.|s^e
me013|there should i there should just be a i should have a button.|s
me013|just press press each meeting saying we need more disk space this week.|s
me011|the more disk space button?|qy^d^rt
me011|yep.|b
me013|skip the rest of the conversation.|s^co
me018|well we've collected so far something like uh sixty five meetings.|s
me018|and it's about a gig uncompressed.|s
me013|and and how much does each meeting take?|qw^rt
mn014|it's it's a little bit more as i usually don't do not uncompress the all of the p z m and the p d a things.|s^bc
me018|is a little more?|qy^bu^m^rt
me018|right yeah so if you uncompressed everything it's even more.|s^bk|s
mn014|so|%-
mn014|it's|%-
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|one point five or something.|s
me018|uh compressed how much are they?|qw
me018|like|%-
me011|half a gig.|s
me018|about half?|qy^bh^d^rt
me011|for all of them.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yep.|b
me018|so we're definitely are storing you know all of those.|s
me018|so there's what?|qw^t1
me018|thirty some gig of just meetings so far?|qy^bs
me013|so so so maybe there's a hundred gig or something.|s
me013|or|fh.%
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean because we we have the uncompressed around also.|s
me018|right.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|so it's like|s.%-
me018|right.|b
me018|well we we haven't uncompressed all the meetings.|s
me018|but|fh
me011|i would like to.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|well i mean it's they really are cheap.|s
me013|i mean it's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them.|s
me018|right.|b
me011|yep.|b
me013|but but uh we could you know if you want to get four disks get four disks.|s
me013|i mean it's it's small i mean these things are just a few hundred dollars.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me018|well i sent that message out to i guess you and dave asking for if we could get some disk.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|i i sent this out a a day ago.|s
me011|and put it where?|qw
me013|right.|b
me018|but and dave didn't respond so i i don't know how the whole process works.|s
me018|i mean does he just go out and get them and if it's okay and|qy.%--
me011|yep.|b
me018|so i was assuming he was going to take over that.|s
me018|but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving.|s
me013|yeah i think you need a direct conversation with him.|s^cs
me013|and just say an just ask him that you know what should you do.|s^cs:qw
me013|and in my answer back was are you sure you just want one.|s:qy
me013|so i mean i think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure well here's what we figure on doing for the next few months.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|i know what they want.|s
me011|the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so they don't want to stack up external drives.|s
me011|um and then they want everything else in the machine room.|fh|s
me013|right.|b
me011|so the question is where are you going to hang them?|qw
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|i don't know what the space situation is in the machine room.|s
me011|right.|b
me018|so|%-
me013|right.|b
me013|so this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave.|s
mn017|the|%-
me018|i think part of the reason why dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now.|s
me013|because it|s^df.%-
mn017|one|%-
mn017|huh.|%
me011|yep.|b
mn017|one one one thing to to um to do when you need to conserve space is|s.%--
me018|so he has to re arrange a bunch of stuff.|s
mn017|i bet there are still some old uh like nine gig disks uh around.|s
mn017|and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks.|s
mn017|and and you know recover the space.|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|no.|fg
me013|i think dave dave knows all these things of course.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|and so he always has a lot of plans of things that he's going to do to make things better in many ways and runs out of time.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|but i i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk.|s
me011|and so i think what he's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system rather than on new disk.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me011|so|fh
me013|well.|fg
me013|so|s.%--
me011|which|%-
me013|but this this is a very specific question for me.|s
me013|basically we can easily get one to four disks.|s
me013|i mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it.|s
me013|it's no big deal.|s
me013|uh but the question is where they go?|fh|qo
me013|and i don't think we can solve that here.|s
mn017|maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there.|s^cs
me013|you just have to ask him.|s^cs
me011|yeah really.|s^aa
me013|attach to|s.%-
me011|popcorn.|s^2
mn017|to the machine that collects the data.|s^2^rt
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|so then you could at least temporarily store stuff there.|s^rt
mn017|the only|%-
me018|huh.|b.%
me011|yeah it's just it's not on the net so it's a little awkward.|s^arp
mn017|what do you mean it's not on the net?|qw^bu
me011|it's not|s.%--
mn014|it's not bad.|s
me011|it's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except s s h.|s
mn017|oh because it's because it's an aciri machine?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn017|oh oh oh.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net.|s
me011|but who knows when that will happen?|qh
me018|that might be a good short term solution though.|s
mn017|but that can't be that hard.|s
mn017|i mean|fh
me011|no the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers.|s
mn017|oh|%-
me011|so they actually have to run a wire somewhere.|s
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|yeah again you know any one of these things is certainly not a big deal.|s
me013|if there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's it's everybody everybody has a has|s.%-
me011|but dave has to do all of them.|s^arp
me013|well all of us have long lists of different things we're doing.|s^nd
me013|but at any rate i think that there's a there's a longer term thing and there's immediate need.|s
me013|and i think we need a a conversation with|s^cs.%--
me013|uh maybe maybe after after tea or something you and i can go down and and talk to him about it.|fh|s^cs.x
me013|just say you know what should we do right now.|s
me018|how long is david going to be gone?|qw^rt
me013|uh eleven days or something.|h|s^rt
me011|oh my!|s^fe
me013|yeah.|b
me013|basically tomorrow and all of the week after.|s^e
me011|and that's all i have.|s^rt^tc
me013|um|fg
me013|let's see.|h
me013|the only thing other thing i was going to add was that um uh i talked briefly to mari.|s
me013|and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here.|s
me013|but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the friday after next.|s
me013|and i i i wanted to make it um after the next one of these meetings.|s
me013|so something that we want to do next meeting is is uh to put together um a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it um that we've done.|s
me013|i mean just sort of bulletize i mean i can i can dream up text but this is basically going to lead to the annual report.|s
me013|so um if|fh|%-
mn017|uhhuh.|b.%
me011|this is the fifteenth?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|um that would|h|%-
me011|so just a week from tomorrow?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|so uh we can|fh|%--
me013|this|%-
mn017|is this got to be in the morning?|qy^rt
me013|so that's an|%-
me013|um|h
mn017|or|%--
mn017|because you know i fridays i have to leave uh like around uh two.|s
mn017|so if it could be before that would be be|s^cs.%-
me013|no no but i i i don't need other folks for the meeting.|s^nd
me013|i can do it.|s
mn017|oh okay all right.|s^bk
me013|all i'm saying is that on|s.%-
mn017|oh i'm sorry i misunderstood.|s^fa
mn017|i thought you are|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so what i meant was on the this meeting if i something i i i'm making a major thing in the agenda is i want to help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so i can tell her.|s
mn017|okay.|b
mn017|all right.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|okay.|b
me013|i think i have a pretty good idea.|s
me013|but but um|fh
me013|uh and then the next day uh late in the day i'll be having that that discussion with her.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|um so|fh
mn017|um uh one thing i mean we in past meetings we had um also you know various variously talked about the um work that uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side.|fg|s^tc
mn017|um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so um and i wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting.|s^cs
mn017|and between you know whoever's interested in that.|s
mn017|because i feel that uh there's plenty of stuff to talk about.|s^df
mn017|but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh|s.%--
me013|think so?|qy^bh
mn017|well it's that it's just going to be very boring for people who are not you know sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system.|s
me011|i'm interested.|s^nd
mn014|me too.|s^aa
me013|well okay so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition?|fg|qw
me018|jane may not be.|s
me011|jane i think.|s
mn017|well i know well jane|s.%--
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|well you mean in a separate meeting or talking about it in this|qr.%--
me011|no.|s^ar
me011|if we talked about it in this meeting.|s
me018|he's wondering how much overlap there will be.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah so you're|fg|%-
me013|so|%-
mn017|so|fg
mn017|uh uh|fh
mn017|liz and jane probably.|s
me013|okay so we're going to have a guy's meeting.|s^bk|s
me018|good thing liz isn't here.|s
me013|real|%-
mn017|uh if you want to put it that way.|s
me001|watch a ball game?|qy^d^j^rt
me013|yeah real real real men real men do decoding or something like that.|s^j
me018|don't listen to this liz.|s^co^t3
mn017|right.|b
me013|uh|%-
mn017|i mean it's sort of i mean when when the talk is about data collection stuff sometimes i've you know i i'm bored.|s^by
me013|yeah.|b
me011|the nod off?|qy^j^rt
mn017|so it's i i can sympathize with them not wanting to to to be uh you know if i you know this could|s.%-
me013|it's because you have a|s.%-
me013|so you need a better developed feminine side.|s^co
mn017|heh!|b
mn017|i'm not sure i want to|s.%-
me013|there's probably going to be a lot of bleeps in this meeting.|s
me011|yeah i would i would guess.|s^aa
me013|uh um|fh
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|and|%-
me013|i think it must be uh nearing the end of the week.|s
me013|um yeah.|fh|s^bk
me013|i you know i i've heard some comments about like this.|s^tc
me013|that could be.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b.%
me013|i mean the|%--
me013|um|fh|%-
mn017|and we don't have to do it every week.|s^cs
me018|could we|qy.%-
mn017|we could do it every other week or so.|s^cs
me018|right i was|s^aa|%-
mn017|you know or whenever we feel like we|s.%-
me018|why don't we alternate this meeting every other week?|qw^cs^rt
me011|or just alternate the focus.|s^2^cs^ng
me018|that's what i mean.|s
me011|yeah so on even weeks have basic on data.|s^e
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|we could do that yeah.|s^na
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|i i personally i'd i'm not in favor of more meetings.|s
mn017|um because uh|fh|s.%-
me013|right.|b
mn017|you know|%-
me011|i am.|s^j^nd
me011|oh|s^fa.%-
me018|but i i don't i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder.|s
mn017|right.|b
me018|so if we did that|s.%-
me011|well except that we keep going for our full time.|s
mn014|yep.|b
me018|well because we get into these other topics.|fg|s^ng
me001|yeah.|b
mn017|we feel we feel obligated to collect more data.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me018|so if we could alternate the focus of the meeting|s^cs.%-
me011|i don't.|s^ar
me011|let's read digits and go.|s^co^t1
me013|why don't we just start with that?|qw^cs
me013|and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics not coming up then we can expand into another meeting.|s^cs
mn017|umm okay.|s^bk
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but i i think that's a great idea.|s^ba
me013|uh so uh um let's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance see what they think and|fh|s^cs.%--
mn017|uhhuh.|b.%
me018|yeah that would be good.|fg|s
me018|i mean andreas and i have various talks in the halls.|s
me018|and there's lots of things you know details and stuff that would i think people would be interested in.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me018|and i'd you know where do we go from here kind of things and|s.%--
me018|so it would be good.|s^r^rt
me013|yeah and you're you're attending the uh the front end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best|s.%--
me013|you and i i guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two.|s
me011|bridge.|s^2
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|we are doing recognition in both of them.|s
me013|so|fh
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|right.|b
me013|uh|fh
mn017|so um|fg
me011|okay.|b
mn017|so so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there's some time.|s^cs^tc
me011|no no that would be for next week.|s^ar
mn017|um i so the latest result was that um|s.%--
mn017|um yot i tested the uh the sort of final version of the p l p configuration um on development test data for for this year's hub five test set.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and the recognition performance was exactly and i mean exactly up to the you know the first decimal same as with the uh mel cepstra front end.|s
me011|huh.|b.%
me018|for both females and males?|qy^bu^rt
mn017|yes.|s^aa
me018|oh!|s^bk^fe
mn017|uh well there was a little bit of a|s^bd.%--
mn017|overall.|s
mn017|they they were the males i think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|i mean definitely not significant.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b.%
me018|uhhuh.|b.%
mn017|and then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half per cent improvement.|s
me011|wow.|b
mn017|so|%-
me011|just with rover?|qy^bu^rt
mn017|with n best rover which is like our new and improved version of rover.|s
me011|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn017|which actually uses the whole n best list from both systems to uh combine that.|s
me013|so except i mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto regressive versus the cepstral truncation.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|b
mn017|and the|%-
me018|but a per cent and a half.|s^rt
me018|that's|%-
me011|yeah it's pretty impressive.|s^ba
mn017|and and so uh after i told the my uh colleagues at s r i about that you know now they definitely want to you know uh have a|s.%--
mn017|next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh you know basically at least the system combination.|s
mn017|um and you know why not?|fh|qh
me013|sure why not?|s^aa|qh^m
mn017|uh so|fh
me011|we clearly got to add a few more features though.|s^cs
mn017|uh what do you mean?|h|qw^bu
mn017|more features in the sense of front end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles?|qr
me011|no uh front end features.|s
me011|you know we did p l p and mel cepstra.|s
me011|let's you know try rasta and m s g and|s.%--
mn017|oh i mean|s.%-
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|well|fg
mn017|right.|b
mn017|so we|s.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|that's the the the|s.%--
mn017|there's one thing uh i mean you don't want to overdo it because every front end|s.%--
mn017|you know if you you know you basically multiply your effort by n where n is a number of different systems.|s
me018|oh.|b.%
me013|uhhuh.|b.%
mn017|and um|fh
mn017|so so one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system.|s
mn017|and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems.|s
mn017|and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um thing.|s
me013|huh.|b
me018|do you think we'd still get the one and a half uh|qy^rt.%--
mn017|so|fh
mn017|i i think so.|s^aa
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower.|s
mn017|and so if|s.%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|you know maybe it's only one per cent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing.|s
mn017|so|fh
mn017|um you know just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely.|s
me011|cool.|s^ba
mn017|and then we had some results on digits uh with um|s^tc.%--
mn017|we we|%--
mn017|so this was uh really really sort of just to get dave going with his um experiments.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and so uh|s.%--
mn017|but as a result um you know we were sort of wondering why is the hub five system doing so well on the digits.|s
mn017|and the reason is basically there's a whole bunch of read speech data in the hub five training set.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|right.|b
me013|including digits i gather yeah.|s
mn017|and you|s.%-
mn017|and|s.%-
mn017|not all of|s.%--
mn017|no it's actually digits is only a maybe a fifth of it.|s^nd
mn017|the rest is is read is read timit data and uh atis data and wall street journal and stuff like that.|s
me013|a fifth of it is how much?|qw
me013|right.|fg
me013|but a a fifth is how much?|qw^r
mn017|a fifth would be maybe uh two hours something.|s
me013|yeah so i mean that's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|but it definitely helps to have the other read data in there.|s
me013|so|fh
mn017|because we're doing|s.%--
me013|oh yeah?|qy^bh^d
mn017|you know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on uh timit uh not timit uh t i digits.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|which is only what?|qw
mn017|two hours something?|qy^bu^rt
me013|right.|b
me011|i don't know.|s^no
mn017|so uh more read speech data definitely helps.|s
mn017|and you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty.|s
mn017|that's|%-
me013|yeah that was the interesting thing.|s
mn017|that was|%-
me013|because because uh it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better.|s
mn017|right right.|b
me013|but but uh|fh
mn017|right.|b
me018|well is there even more read speech data around?|qy^rt
mn017|oh yeah.|s^bk
mn017|so we only for the hub five training we're only using uh a fairly small subset of the macrophone data base.|s^na
me018|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn017|um so you could beef that up and probably do even better.|fh|s^cs
me011|i could also put in uh focus condition zero from hub four from broadcast news which is mostly prepared speech.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b.%
me011|it's not exactly read speech but it's pretty darn close.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|well i mean that's plenty of read speech data.|s
mn017|i mean wall street journal uh take one example.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me011|that's right.|b
mn017|but um|%--
mn017|so you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than t i digits.|s
me011|yeah.|b.%
me013|well they been using timit.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me013|that|s.%--
me013|uh they they uh they experimented for a while with a bunch of different data bases with french and spanish and so forth because they're multi lingual tests.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and and uh um and actually the best results they got were uh using timit.|s
me011|huh.|b
me013|uh but uh which so that's what they're they're using now.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|but but yeah certainly if we um|s.%--
me013|if we knew what the structure of what we're doing there was.|s
me013|i mean there's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so we don't know exactly which combination we're going to be going with.|s
me013|once we know then the trainable parts of it it'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|well that was that.|s^tc
mn017|and then i guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system.|s^tc
mn017|and you want to you want to see where that stands?|qy^cs^d
me018|well i'm|s.%-
me018|yeah so andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the s r i system uses.|s
me018|and so i'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with.|s
me018|and uh so then i'll train the net.|s
me018|and|s.%-
mn017|and one side effect of that would be that it's um that the phone set would change.|s
me018|right.|b
mn017|so the m l p would be trained on i think only forty six or forty eight|s.%--
me018|eight.|s^bc
mn017|forty eight phones.|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we've been using so far.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and that that that will probably help actually.|s
me018|so it's a little different.|s
mn017|because um the fewer dimensions uh the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um um|s.%--
mn017|just|s.%--
mn017|you know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features.|s
mn017|and so you have to multiply everything by two or three.|s
mn017|and so you know fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view.|s
me013|sure.|fg
me013|although we i mean it's not that many fewer and and and we take a k l t anyway so we could|s.%-
mn017|right.|fg
mn017|exactly.|fg
mn017|so so that was the other thing.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and then we wanted to just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front end.|s
mn017|so that would mean just doing the top i don't know ten or twelve or something of the k l t dimensions.|s
me013|yeah and i think and we again check we should check with stephane.|s^cs
me013|my impression was that when we did that before that had very little uh he didn't lose very much.|s
mn017|right.|b
me018|by just taking the top whatever?|qy^bu^d
me011|yep.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|but then|s.%--
mn017|and then something|s.%--
mn017|once we have the new m l p trained up uh one thing i wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know those features.|s
mn017|uh and uh retrain m l p and also the you know the dictionary that we use for the hub five system.|fh|s
me013|and the and the base starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from from a pretty decent system.|s
mn017|exactly.|s^bk
me018|right.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|so that would basically give us a um more hopefully a a better system.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|um because you know compared to what eric did a while ago where he trained up i think a system based on broadcast news.|fh|s
mn017|and then uh retraining it on switchboard.|s
mn017|or uh and|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|but he i think he he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available.|s
mn017|and his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as as the as ours is.|s
mn017|so|s.%-
me013|that's that's certainly one thing yeah.|s^ba
mn017|and the dictionary made a huge difference.|s
me013|uh yeah.|b
mn017|uh we we made some improvements to the dictionary's uh to the dictionary about two years ago.|fh|s
mn017|which resulted in a uh something like a four per cent absolute error rate reduction on switchboard.|s
mn017|which|%-
me013|well the other thing is dipping deep into history and into uh our resource management days when we were collaborating with s r i before.|s^rt
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|s
me013|uh it was i think it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment.|fh|s
me013|when we were working together we got our initial alignments from decipher uh at the time.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|uh and later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems.|fh|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|because they were consistent.|s
me013|but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty per cent error uh rate.|s
me013|uh but that was a that was a good good good way to start.|fh|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|okay.|b
me013|and we're not quite that bad with our our switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as s r i's.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|so|s.%-
me018|what is the performance on the best switchboard system that we've done?|qw
mn017|right.|b
me018|roughly?|qw^e
me013|well the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty per cent error.|s
me013|and uh it was|s.%--
me013|i think there's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for.|s
me013|we never did really fix up the dictionary.|s
me013|uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were going to do.|s
me013|and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|but that|s.%-
me013|uh we never did never did any adaptation.|s
mn017|even that that number|s.%-
mn017|right.|fg
me013|uh we never did any|fh|s.%-
mn017|and and that number i think was on switchboard one data.|s
mn017|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|where the error rate now is in the twenties.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|so um|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so we were|s.%--
mn017|that's yet|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|we were probably at least a factor or two off.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|so it would be so it would be good to sort of uh|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|but i think again it's|s.%--
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|it's the it's the conversational speech bit.|s
me013|because our our broadcast news system is actually pretty good.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|he knows.|s
mn017|right.|s^bk
mn017|and the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the m l p is trained up.|s
mn017|right?|qy^d^g
mn017|because it's a pretty good um indicator of that.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so it's sort of a sanity check of the m l p outputs before we go ahead and train up the uh you know use them as a basis for the tandem system.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|it'll still probably be worse.|s
me013|i mean it's it'd be context independent and so on.|s
mn017|no.|s^ar
mn017|sure.|s^aa
me018|should we should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training?|qy^rt
mn017|not|%-
mn017|but|%-
me013|but|%-
me018|i mean should should we even use that?|qy^rt
mn017|oh oh that's a good question.|s^bk
me018|or should i just go straight to|qrr.%-
mn017|yeah we we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments um from the s r i recognizer.|h|s^no
mn017|or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign.|s
me011|try it.|s^co
me011|you run it.|s^co^rt
me011|keep keep both versions.|s^co^rt
me011|see which one's better.|s^co
me013|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
me013|i mean i think i agree with|s.%--
me013|i mean basically you would then you proceed with the embedded training.|s^cs
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|it's going to take you a while to train at this net anyway.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|and while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did.|s^cs
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me018|huh.|b
mn017|all right.|b
me011|i could make arguments either way.|s
mn017|but but so i|s.%-
me011|you know it's|%-
mn017|well but|%-
me011|sort of given up guessing.|s
mn017|but in your experience i mean uh have you seen big improvements in on some tasks with embedded training?|qy^rt
mn017|or was it sort of smallish uh improvements that you got?|qrr
me013|uh well it depended on the task.|fh|s
me013|i mean i think in this one i would sort of expect it to be important.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|because we're coming from uh alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system.|s^df
mn017|that are from another|s^2.%-
mn017|right.|b
mn017|right.|b
me011|although i mean we've done it with when we were combining with the cambridge recurrent neural net embedded training made it worse.|s
me013|uh|fh
me011|which i've never figured out.|s
me013|right.|s^aa
me013|but i mean|s^arp.%-
me011|i think it's a bug.|s
mn017|so you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the cambridge uh system?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn017|and then|s.%--
mn017|uh uh|fh
me011|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|fg
mn017|well that might probably just|s.%--
mn017|huh.|fh
mn017|that was probably because your initial system i mean your system was worse than cambridge's.|s
mn017|and you um|%-
me013|was it?|qy^bu^rt
me013|i don't think it was.|s^ng
me011|no.|s^aa
me011|they were they were comparable.|s^e^nd
mn017|it wasn't?|qy^bh
me013|no.|s^aa
mn017|really?|qy^bh
me011|they were very close.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|that's weird.|s^ba
me013|excuse me?|qw^bu^rt
mn017|that's that's weird.|s^r^rt
mn017|no i mean it's weird that it did|s^df.%-
me013|oh!|s^fe
me011|that's what i said.|s
mn017|i'm sorry.|s^fa
mn017|it's|s.%--
mn017|it's weird that it got worse.|s
me018|that's ambiguous.|s
me013|um no.|fh|s^ba
me013|uh we've i mean and with the numbers o g i numbers task we've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better.|fh|s
mn017|oh actually it's not that weird.|s
mn017|because we have seen|s^df.%--
mn017|we have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|it just|s.%-
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|but i but i would i would suspect that something that that had um a very different um feature set for instance.|s
me013|i mean they were using pretty similar feature sets to us.|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|i i would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me018|what about uh hidden unit size on this?|qw
me013|oh wait a minute.|s^co
me013|and the other thing uh|s.%--
me018|oh.|b
me013|sorry.|s^fa^t3
me013|it was the other thing is that what was in common to the cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|so i mean uh that's another pretty big difference.|s
me011|uh yeah.|b
me011|that's another big difference.|s
me013|and uh one at least|s.%-
me013|back at|s.%-
mn017|you mean with soft targets?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|or|qrr.%--
mn017|sorry i'm|s^fa.%--
mn017|i missed|s.%--
mn017|what what's the key issue here?|qw^rt
me013|oh that uh both the cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors.|s
me013|and if we're we're coming from alignments coming from the s r i system it's a likelihood based system.|s
me013|so so that's another difference.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|i mean you know there's different front end different different uh um training criterion.|s
me013|uh i would think that in that an embedded uh embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more.|fh|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but we don't know.|s^no
mn017|okay.|b
me013|you going to say something?|qy^d^rt^tc
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me018|i was wondering uh you know what size net i should|s^r.%--
me018|anybody have any intuitions or suggestions?|qo
me013|uh how much training data?|qw^rt
me018|well i was going to start off with the small train set.|s
me013|and how how many hours is that?|qw^rt
me018|that's why i was|s.%--
me018|i i'm not sure how much that is.|s^no
mn017|uh i think that has about|fg|s.%--
mn017|well you'd would be gender dependent training.|s^bu
mn017|right?|qy^d^g
me018|gender dependent yeah.|s^aa^m
mn017|so so i think it's uh that's about huh something like thirty hours.|s
me018|thirty hours?|qy^d^m^rt
mn017|thirty hours per gender.|s^aa^e
me011|i'm not sure what this'll mean.|s^no.x
me018|in the small training set?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|hello?|qo^rt^t3
mn017|i i think so.|s^aa
mn017|i'll|%--
me011|excuse me?|qw^br^rt^t3
mn017|it's definitely less than a hundred.|s
mn017|you know it's more like like thirty forty hours.|s
me011|all right.|s^bk^t3
mn017|something like that.|s
me011|wrong number.|s^t3
me018|they called to tell us that?|qy^d^rt
mn017|yeah.|b.%
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|um so uh after run|fg|s.%-
me018|i mean i didn't want to do too big.|s
me013|right.|s^bk
me018|just|%--
me013|so|s.%--
me013|at least a couple thousand hidden units.|s
me013|i mean|s.%--
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|it's it's the thing i'll i'll think about it a little more.|s
me013|but it it'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|you definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand.|s^cs
me013|it's it's more than|s.%-
me018|and a thousand is too small?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|oh let me think about it.|h
me013|but i think that that uh at some point there's diminishing returns.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean it doesn't actually get worse typically.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|but it but but there is diminishing returns.|s^e
me013|and you're doubling the amount of time.|s
mn017|remember you'll have a smaller output layer so there's going to be fewer parameters there.|s
me011|but not by a lot.|s^arp
me013|not by much.|s^arp
mn017|and then|%-
me013|fifty fifty four to forty eight?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|vast majority is from the input unit.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|it'll have a very tiny effect.|s
me011|right because you used the context windows.|s^aa|s
me011|and so the input to hidden is much much larger.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|oh i see.|s^bk
mn017|i see.|s^bk
mn017|yeah of course.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b.%
mn017|it's negligible okay.|s^bs|s^bk
me013|yeah so it's it'd be way way less than ten per cent of the difference.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh there's uh|fh|s.%--
me013|how how big|qw.%-
me013|let's see.|h
me013|what am i trying to think of?|qw^t1
me018|the the net that that we did use already uh was eight thousand hidden units.|s
me018|and that's the one that eric trained up.|s
me013|right.|s^bk
me013|and that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of of speech.|s
mn017|was that gender dependent or independent?|qrr
me018|gender dependent.|s
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|so that would be like trained on sixty or seventy hours.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so uh|fh
me013|yeah definitely not the one thousand uh two thousand|s.%--
me013|i mean the four thousand will be better.|s
me013|and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good.|s
me011|it'll be faster.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|so|fh
me018|maybe i'll start off with two thousand just to see.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|okay.|b
me018|okay.|b
me013|yeah thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds.|fg|s
me013|uh so that's like eleven eleven million frames.|fh|s
me013|and a two thousand hidden unit net is uh i guess about seven eight hundred thousand parameters.|s
me013|so that's probably that's probably fine.|s
me013|i mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from.|s
me013|but the two thousand would be faster.|s
me013|so|fh
mn017|right.|fg
mn017|i actually have to go.|s
