fe004|are you doing something?|rt
fe004|okay then i guess i'm doing something.|bk
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|so basically the result of much thinking since the last time we met um but not as much writing um is a sheet that i have a lot of like thoughts and justification of comments on.|s
fe004|but i'll just pass out as is right now.|s
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|here.|s
fe004|if you could pass this around.|cs
fe004|and there's two things.|s
fe004|and so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification.|s
fn050|um|%--
fe004|and the other side is um sort of a revised construction formalism.|s
fn050|the|%--
fn050|wait.|co
me045|this is just one sheet right?|bu
fn050|uh.|bk
fe004|it's just one sheet.|na
fn050|just one sheet.|na
fe004|it's just a nothing else.|s
fn050|okay.|bk
fn050|front back.|s
fe004|um|fh
fe004|enough to go around?|bu
fe004|okay.|bk
fe004|and in some ways it's it's it's very similar to|s
fe004|there are very few changes in some ways from what we've um uh done before.|s
fe004|but i don't think everyone here has seen all of this.|s
fe004|so uh i'm not sure where to begin.|s
fe004|um as usual the disclaimers are there are all these things are|s
fe004|it's only slightly more stable than it was before.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and um after a little bit more discussion and especially like keith and i i have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days um it'll probably change again some more.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um maybe i will|s
fe004|let's start let's start on number two actually on the notation.|s
fe004|um because that's|df
fe004|i'm thinking possibly a little more familiar to um to people.|s
fe004|okay so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract|s
fe004|it's sort of like um listings of the kinds of things that we can have.|s
fe004|and certain things that have um changed have changed back to this.|s
fe004|there there's been a little bit of um going back and forth.|s
fe004|but basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name.|s
fe004|i forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line.|s
me010|what i was going to|s
fe004|so something like um|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|well there's an example.|s
fe004|the textual example at the end has clausal construction.|s
fe004|so|fh
fe004|um just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful latex.|s
fe004|it could be you know simple old text as well.|s
fe004|um there are a couple of|s
fe004|uh these three have various ways of doing certain things.|s
fe004|so i'll just try to go through them.|s
fe004|so they could all have a type at the beginning.|s
fe004|um and then they say the key word construction.|s
me010|oh i see.|bk
fe004|and they have some name.|s
me010|so so the current syntax is if it if there's a type it's before|bu
fe004|yeah right.|aa
me010|okay that's fine.|bk
fe004|okay and then it has a block that is constituents.|fg
fe004|and as usual i guess all the constructions all the examples here have only um tsk one type of constituent.|s
fe004|that is a constructional constituent.|e
fe004|i think that's actually going to turn out to be certainly the most common kind.|s
fe004|but in general instead of the word construct here you might have meaning or form as well.|s
fe004|okay?|d
fe004|so if there's some element that doesn't that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning.|s
fe004|okay.|bk
fe004|um the main change with the constructs which each of which has um the key word construct and then some name and then some type specification is that it's|fh
fe004|it's it's often sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is.|s
fe004|so for example whatever i have here is going to be a form of the word throw.|s
fe004|or it's going to be a form of the word you know i don't know happy or something like that.|e
fe004|or you know it'll be a specific word.|s
fe004|or maybe you'll have the type.|e
fe004|you'll say i need a uh spatial relation phrase here.|s
fe004|or i need a directional specifier here.|e
fe004|uh you could have a a actual type here.|s
fe004|um or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type.|s
fe004|so a very common example of this is that you know in directed motion the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind.|s
fe004|often a human.|e
fe004|right?|d
fe004|so if i you know um uh run down the street then i|s
fe004|i i run down the street.|s
fe004|it's typed uh i.|s
fe004|meaning category is what's there.|e
fe004|the the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair.|s
fe004|and um|fh
fe004|sort of skipping fonts and whatever.|s
fe004|the idea is that sometimes there are um general constructions that you know that you're going to need.|s
fe004|it's it's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase or something like that there.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and usually it has formal um considerations that will go along with it.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and then uh you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you're talking about.|s
fe004|about what meaning what specific meaning you want.|e
fe004|so the example again at the bottom which is directed motion.|s
fe004|you might need a nominal expression to take the place of you know um the big you know the big the tall dark man you know walked into the room.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|but because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it's nominal of some kind.|s
fe004|but in particular that it's some kind of animate nominal.|s
fe004|and which will apply just as well to like you know a you know a simple proper noun.|s
fe004|or to some complicated expression.|e
fe004|um|fh
fe004|so i don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types.|no
fe004|so|fh
fe004|okay then i don't think the um|bk
fe004|at least|s
fe004|yeah none of these examples have anything different for formal constraints.|bk
fe004|but you can refer to any of the um sort of available elements and scope.|s
fe004|right which here are the constructs to say something about the relation.|f
fe004|and i think if you if you compare like the top block and the textual block um we dropped like the little f. subscript.|s
fe004|the f. subscripts refer to the form piece of the construct.|s
me010|good.|ba
fe004|and i think that um in general it'll be unambiguous.|s
fe004|like if you were giving a formal constraint then you're referring to the formal pole of that.|s
fe004|so so by saying if i just said name one then that means name one formal.|s
fe004|and we're talking about formal which which makes sense.|s
fe004|uh there are certain times when we'll have an exception to that.|s
fe004|in which case you could just indicate here i mean the meaningful for some reason.|e
fe004|right.|f
fe004|or actually it's more often that only to handle this one special case of you know george and jerry walk into the room in that order.|s
fe004|so we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|but but we're not going to really worry about that for right now.|s
fe004|and there are we can be more specific if we have to later on.|s
fe004|okay and so in terms of the the relations.|bk
fe004|you know as usual they're before and ends.|s
fe004|i should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation.|s
fe004|but in form you might also have a value binding.|s
fe004|you know you could say that um you know name one dot you know number equals you know a plural or something like that.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|there are certain things that are attribute value similar to the bindings below.|s
fe004|but i mean they're just usually they're going to be value value fillers right?|s
fe004|okay and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings.|bk
fe004|there was talk of changing the name of that.|s
fe004|and johno and i i you you and i can like fight about that if you like.|s
fe004|but about changing it to semantic effects.|rt
fe004|which i thought was a little bit too order biased.|s
me003|well|%--
fe004|and semantic bindings.|s
fe004|which i thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings.|df
fe004|and so it was an issue whether constraints um there were some linguists who reacted against constraints saying oh if it's not used for matching then it shouldn't be called a constraint.|s
fe004|but i think we want to be uncommitted about whether it's used for matching or not right?|s
fe004|because there are i think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the bindings are for.|df
fe004|actual you know sort of like modified constraining purposes.|e
me010|well you definitely want to de couple the formalism from the parsing strategy.|s
me045|yeah.|bk
me010|so that whether or not it's used for matching or only for verification i|s
fe004|yeah yeah.|bk
fe004|it's used shouldn't matter right.|2
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|for sure.|e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|i mean i don't know what uh term we want to use.|bd
me010|but we don't want to|df
fe004|yeah uh there was one time when when hans explained why constraints was a misleading word for him.|bk
me010|yep.|bk
fe004|and i think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why johno thought it was a misleading term.|s
fe004|which was just an interesting coincidence.|s
fe004|um but uh|fh
fe004|and so i was like okay well both of you don't like it.|s
fe004|fine we can change it.|bk
me010|it's it's gone.|s
fe004|but i i i'm starting to like it again.|s
fe004|so that's why that's why i'll stick with it.|s
me003|but|%--
fe004|so|fh
mn015|well you know what?|qw
mn015|if you have an if then phrase do you know what the then phrase is called?|rt
fe004|what?|qw
fe004|uh a consequent?|bu
mn015|yeah.|aa
fe004|yeah but it's not an if then.|bk
me010|i know.|na
me010|anyway so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put you could put no word.|fg
mn015|no but|ar
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|just meaning.|e
me010|okay?|d
me045|yeah.|bk
me010|and then let|s
fe004|yeah that's true.|aa
me003|so that's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down down here?|bu
fe004|oh oops!|bk
fe004|no that was just a mistake of cut and paste from when i was going with it.|ar
me003|okay.|bk
me010|okay.|bk
fe004|so i'm sorry.|fa
fe004|i didn't mean that one's an unintentional.|s
me003|so this should be semantic and|s
fe004|sometimes i'm intentionally inconsistent.|s
fe004|because i'm not sure yet.|df
fe004|here i actually it was just a mistake.|s
me003|so this definitely should be semantic constraints down at the bottom.|bu
me045|sure.|aa
fe004|yeah.|aa
me003|okay.|bk
fe004|well unless i go with meaning.|s
fe004|but i mean i kind of like meaning better than semantic.|s
me003|or|%--
me010|oh whatever.|bd
fe004|but i think there's vestiges of other people's biases.|s
me010|or|%--
fe004|like|%--
me010|right.|bk
me010|minor problem.|ba
fe004|minor point.|m
me045|extremely.|na
me010|okay.|bk
fe004|okay um|fg
fe004|so i think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information than the top block.|s
fe004|and the bottom block similarly only just you know all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the um uh that you can give dual types.|s
fe004|oh one thing i should mention is about designates.|s
fe004|i think i'm actually inconsistent across these as well.|rt
fe004|so um strike out the m. subscript on the middle block.|co
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so basically now um this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change.|s
fe004|which is that designates isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now.|s
me010|good.|ba
fe004|so we want designates to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects.|s
fe004|but is sort of um really important for say composition later on.|s
fe004|so for instance if some other construction says you know are you of type is this part of type whatever um the designates tells you which sort of part is the meaning part.|s
fe004|okay so if you have like the big red ball you know you want to know if there's an object or a noun.|rt
fe004|well ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase.|s
me045|huh.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it's useful sometimes to talk about um to talk about there also being a designated object.|s
fe004|and we think that that'll be the same one right.|s
fe004|so the ball is the head of the phrase.|s
fe004|the the um big red ball.|e
fe004|and the entity denoted by the word ball is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of um interesting larger element.|s
me010|and the|s
me010|yeah.|aa
me010|and there's uh there's some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head.|bu
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|and and this enables you to get that if i understand you right.|bu
me045|yeah.|aa
fe004|right right.|aa
me045|that's the idea.|na
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|yeah yeah.|bk
fe004|and uh you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head final language you can refer to the head as a the you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision.|s
me010|right.|bk
fe004|so that's a useful thing.|s
fe004|so that you can get some internal structural constraints in.|df
me010|okay so that all looks good.|bk
me010|let me|s
me010|oh oh|%--
me010|i don't know.|no
me010|were you finished?|qy
fe004|um there was a list of things that isn't included.|h
fe004|but you you can you can ask a question.|s
fe004|that might it.|e
me010|okay.|bk
me010|so if i understand this the|s
me010|aside from uh construed and all that sort of stuff the the differences are mainly that we've gone to the possibility of having form meaning pairs for a type.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|or actually gone back to.|bsc
fe004|right.|b
me010|if we go back far enough|s
fe004|well except for their construction meaning.|arp
fe004|so it's not clear that|s
fe004|uh|fh
fe004|well right now it's a uh construction type and meaning type.|s
fe004|so i don't know what a form type is.|no
me010|oh i see.|bk
me010|yeah yeah yeah.|aa
me010|i'm sorry.|fa
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|you're right.|s
me010|a construction type.|s
me010|uh that's fine.|ba
fe004|right.|bk
me010|but it um|s
fe004|well and a previous um you know version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it.|s
fe004|so you could say construct of type whatever designates something.|s
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|but that was mostly for reference purposes.|s
fe004|just to refer to the meaning pole.|s
fe004|i don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning type constraint on the meaning.|s
fe004|which is really what we want most of the time i think.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|i i don't know if we'll ever have a case where we actually|no
fe004|if there is a form category constraint you could imagine having a triple there that says you know that's kind of weird.|s
me010|no no no i don't think so.|ar
me010|i think that you'll you'll do fine.|ba
me045|i|%--
me010|in fact these are um|s
me010|as long as as mark isn't around these are form constraints.|s
me010|so a nominal expression is uh the fact that it's animate is semantic.|s
me010|the fact that it's uh a nominal expression i would say on most people's notion of of you know higher form types this this is one.|e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|right right.|bk
me045|yeah yeah.|bk
me010|and i think that's just fine.|ba
fe004|which is fine yeah.|m
me045|it's that now um i'm mentioned this.|s
me010|yeah.|bk
me045|i i don't know if i ever explained this.|bd
me045|but the point of um|s
me045|i mentioned in the last meeting the point of having something called nominal expression is um|s
me045|because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for you know like say taking as its object just some expression which um designates an object or designates a thing or whatever um that leads to some syntactic problems basically.|rt
me045|so you want to you know you sort of have this problem like okay well i'll put the word uh let's say the word dog.|s
me045|you know and that has to come right after the verb.|f
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|because we know verb meets its object.|df
me045|and then we have a construction that says oh you can have the preceding a noun.|s
me045|and so you'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum.|s
me010|right.|b
me045|and you could get you know the kicked dog or something like that meaning kicked the dog.|s
me010|right.|b
me045|um so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there.|s
me045|but|fh
me010|that i i have no problem with it at all.|ba
me045|yeah.|bk
fe004|yeah.|bk
me010|i think it's fine.|ba
fe004|right|bk
fe004|you may be you may not be like everyone else in in berkeley.|s
me045|yeah.|bk
me045|yeah.|bk
fe004|but that's okay.|ba
me045|i mean we we we sort of thought we were getting away with uh with a|s
fe004|uh we don't mind either.|bd
fe004|so|fh
me045|i mean this is not reverting to the x. bar theory of of phrase structure.|s
me010|right.|bk
me045|but uh|fh
fe004|right.|bk
me045|i just know that this is like we didn't originally have in mind that uh that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but they do.|df
me045|um|fh
me045|but they does.|m
fe004|well there's an alternative to this.|s
me045|at least in english.|aap
fe004|which is um the question was did we want directed motion|s
me010|yeah.|aa
fe004|which is an argument structure construction|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|did we want it to worry about um anything more than the fact that it you know has semantic|qy
fe004|you know it's sort of frame based construction.|s
fe004|so one option that you know keith had mentioned also was like well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject predicate basically things like grammatical relations.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|those could intersect with these.|s
fe004|in such a way that subject predicate or subject predicate subject verb you know verb object would require that those things that fill a subject and object are nom expressions.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|and that would be a little bit cleaner in some way.|s
fe004|but you know for now i mean|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|but it it's yeah just moving it moving the the the constraints around.|bd
fe004|uh you know.|fh
fe004|moving it to another place right.|m
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|okay so that's|fg
fe004|but there does basically the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere right?|bu
me010|right.|aa
fe004|so|fh
fe004|yeah.|bk
me010|and so that was the|s
fe004|robert's not happy now?|bu
mn015|no.|ar
fe004|oh okay.|bk
me010|okay and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair.|fg
fe004|yes.|bk
me010|instead of just the meaning.|e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and that aside from some terminology that's basically it.|bu
fe004|right.|aa
me010|i just want to i'm i'm asking.|bd
fe004|yep.|aa
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|bk
fe004|yeah.|bk
fe004|um the sort of the un addressed questions in this um definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about.|s
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|here are just bindings.|e
fe004|but|%--
fe004|right.|f
fe004|we might want to introduce mental spaces.|rt
fe004|you know there's all these things that we don't|s
me010|the whole the mental space thing is clearly not here.|nd
fe004|right.|aa
fe004|so there's going to be some extra you know definitely other notation we'll need for that which we skip for now.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|by the way i do want to get on that as soon as robert gets back.|s
fe004|uh|fh
fe004|yeah.|bk
fe004|okay.|bk
me010|so uh the the mental space thing.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|um obviously construal is a is a is a big component of that.|s
me010|so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back.|s
me010|but sort of as soon as he gets back i think um we ought to|cs
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|so what's the what's the time frame?|qw
me045|i forgot again when|s
me045|you're going away for how long?|qw
mn015|just uh as a sort of a mental bridge i'm not i'm skipping fourth of july.|s
me045|okay.|bk
mn015|so uh right afterwards i'm back.|s
me045|okay.|bk
fe004|what?|qw
fe004|you're missing like the premier american holiday?|bu
fe004|what's the point of spending a year here?|j
mn015|uh i've had it often enough.|bd
fe004|so anyway|s
me003|well he he went to college here.|df
fe004|oh yeah i forgot.|aa
fe004|oops sorry.|fa
me010|yeah.|bk
fe004|okay.|bk
me010|and furthermore it's well worth missing.|s
fe004|not in california.|arp
fe004|yeah that's true.|aa
me045|yes.|aa
fe004|i like i i like spending fourth of july in other countries whenever i can.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|um|fh
me010|okay so that's great.|fg
fe004|construal.|tc
fe004|okay so|bk
fe004|oh so there was one question that came out.|s
fe004|i hate this thing.|s
fe004|sorry.|fa
fe004|um which is|s
fe004|so something like past which you know we think is a very simple uh we've often just stuck it in as a feature.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|you know oh this event takes place before speech time okay is what this means.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|um it's often thought of as it is also considered a mental space.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|you know by you know lots of people around here.|e
me010|right.|b
fe004|so there's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say in france blah blah blah.|rt
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and you have to build up you you would imagine that would require you you know to be very specific about the machinery.|s
fe004|whereas past is a very conventionalized one.|s
fe004|and we sort of know what it means.|s
fe004|but it we doesn't don't necessarily want to you know unload all the notation every time we see that it's past tense.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|so you know we could think of our uh just like x. schema walk refers to this complicated structure past refers to you know a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it.|s
me010|i think that's exactly right.|na
fe004|so so we're kind of like having our cake and eating it.|s
fe004|you know having it both ways right?|e
me010|yeah.|aa
fe004|so|%--
me010|yeah no i think i think that we'll have to see how it works out when we do the details.|aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but my intuition would be that that's right.|df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah okay.|bk
mn015|do you want to do the same for space?|rt
fe004|sorry?|br
mn015|space.|r
fe004|space?|br
mn015|here.|e
mn015|now.|e
fe004|oh oh oh oh instead of just time?|bk
fe004|yeah yeah yeah.|aa
mn015|uhhuh.|aa
fe004|same thing.|na
fe004|so there are very conventionalized like deictic ones right?|s
fe004|and then i think for other spaces that you introduce you could just attach|s
fe004|whatever.|s
fe004|you could build up an appropriately uh appropriate structure according to the the sentence.|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|well this this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your c. dot something.|s
fe004|yeah.|aa
mn015|you know where where it's contextually dependent.|e
fe004|right.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|what is now?|qh
mn015|what was past?|qh
mn015|what is in the future?|qh
mn015|where is this?|qh
mn015|what is here?|qh
mn015|what is there?|qh
mn015|what is|qh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah.|aa
fe004|so time and space.|s
fe004|um we'll we'll get that on the other side a little like very minimally.|s
fe004|there's a sort there's a slot for setting time and setting place.|s
me010|good.|ba
fe004|and|fh
fe004|you know you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place.|s
fe004|and then there are many more interestingly linguistically anyway there are relative things that you know you relate the event in time and space to where you are now.|s
fe004|if there's something a lot more complicated like or so hypothetical or whatever then you have to do your job.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|like or somebody's job anyway.|e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|i'm going to point to at random.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|i mean i'm i'm curious about how much of the mental|s
me045|i mean i'm not sure that the formalism sort of the grammatical side of things is going to have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff.|no
me045|you know um basically all of these so-called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of|s
me045|i think of it as sort of giving you the coordinates of you know|s
me045|assuming that at any point in discourse there's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios whatever and the speaker's supposed to be keeping track of those the um the construction that you actually get is just going to sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you've already got going um you're supposed to add structure to.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|so in france uh watergate wouldn't have hurt nixon or something like that.|s
me045|um well you say all right i'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past france universe or something like that.|s
me045|the information in the sentence tells you that much.|s
me045|but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is.|s
me045|so for example depending on the linguistic uh context it could be|s
me045|like the question is for example what does watergate refer to there?|qh
me045|does it you know does it refer to um|qh
me045|if you just hear that sentence cold the assumption is that when you say watergate you're referring to a watergate like scandal as we might imagine it happening in france.|s
me045|but in a different context oh you know if nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't you know watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the u.s.|s
me045|and in france it wouldn't have hurt him at all.|s
me045|now we're now that watergate we're now talking about the real one.|s
fe004|they're real right.|na
me045|and the would sort of it's a sort of different dimension of hypothe-theticality right?|s
fe004|i see right.|na
me045|we're not saying what's hypothetical about this world.|e
me045|in the first case hypothetically we're imagining that watergate happened in france.|s
fe004|huh.|b
me045|in the second case we're imagining hypothetically that nixon had apologized right away.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|right.|b
me045|or something right?|e
me045|so a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level.|s
me045|uh um and so|fh
me010|correct.|aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|i don't know where that sits then.|no
mn015|huh.|b
me045|sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant.|e
fe004|it seems like um the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals whatever give you sort of the the most|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|those we i think we can figure out what the possibilities are right?|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|there are sort of a relatively limited number.|df
fe004|and then how they interact with some extra thing like in france or if such and such that's like there are certain ways that they they can|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|you know one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammar gives you.|s
fe004|i think.|bd
me045|yeah.|bk
fe004|but you know whatever.|bd
fe004|we we're|%--
me010|yeah in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going.|fg
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|uh i uh you you|%--
me045|but the whole point of the whole point of what fauconnier and turner have to say about uh mental spaces and blending and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence.|s
me045|you know there's not that much information contained in the sentence.|s
me045|it just says here.|s
me045|add this structure to this space.|s
me045|and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open.|s
me045|an individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on quote what the space configuration is at the time of utterance.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and so somebody's going to have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me i think.|s
me010|well|%--
me010|i think that's right.|na
me010|oh i yeah i uh uh i think that's not i|s
me010|i don't think it's completely right.|nd
me010|i mean in fact a examples you gave in did constrain the meaning|s
me010|the form did constrain the meaning.|s
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|and so um it isn't uh|s
me045|sure but like what what was the point of saying that sentence about nixon and france?|bk
me045|that is not there is nothing about that in the in the sentence really.|s
fe004|that's okay.|bd
fe004|we usually don't know the point of the sentence at all.|df
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|but we know what it's trying to say.|s
fe004|we we know that it's what predication it's setting up.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|yeah.|b
me010|but but bottom line i agree with you.|na
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|that's all.|bd
me045|yeah.|b
me010|that that that we're not expecting much out of the uh|e
fe004|purely linguistic cues right?|2
me010|uh the purely form cues yeah.|m
fe004|so|fh
fe004|huh.|b
me010|and um i mean you're you're the linguist.|fh
me010|but uh it seems to me that these we we you know we've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something.|s
me045|yeah yeah.|b
me010|yeah i mean|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|oh yeah.|aa
me010|uh i i mean that that's my feeling that that these are really hard uh problems that decide exactly what what's going on.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|okay.|bk
fe004|okay so um one other thing i just want to point out is there's a lot of confusion about the terms like profile designate focus et cetera et cetera.|fg
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh right right right.|aa
fe004|um for now i'm going to say like profile s often used|s
fe004|like two uses that come to mind immediately.|s
fe004|one is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else.|s
fe004|so hypotenuse you profiled this guy against the background of the right right triangle.|e
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|okay.|bk
fe004|and the second use um is in framenet.|s
fe004|it's slightly different.|rt
fe004|oh i was asking hans about this.|s
fe004|they use it to really mean um this in a frame this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required.|s
fe004|so they have to be there or expressed in some way.|s
fe004|which which i'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive.|s
fe004|but they're they're different meanings.|s
me010|right.|bk
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so the closest thing|s
fe004|so i was thinking about how it relates to this notation.|s
fe004|for us um|s
fe004|okay so how is it|fg
fe004|so designate|s
me010|does that is that really what they mean in in|qy
fe004|framenet?|2
me010|framenet.|e
me010|i didn't know that.|no
fe004|yeah yeah.|aa
fe004|i i mean i i was a little bit surprised about it too.|ba
fe004|i knew that|s
me010|yeah.|bk
fe004|i thought that that would be something like|s
fe004|there's another term that i've heard for that thing.|s
me010|right okay.|bk
fe004|but they i mean uh well at least hans says they use it that way.|s
fe004|and|fh
me010|well i'll check.|cc
fe004|and maybe he's wrong.|s
fe004|anyway so|fg
fe004|i think the the designate that we have in terms of meaning is really the highlight this thing with respect to everything else okay?|tc
me010|right.|bk
fe004|so this is what what it means.|s
fe004|but the second one seems to be useful.|s
fe004|but we might not need a notation for it.|rt
fe004|we don't have a notation for it.|s
fe004|but we might want one.|s
fe004|so for example we've talked about if you're talking about the lexical item walk.|s
fe004|you know it's an action.|s
fe004|well it also has this idea it carries along with it the idea of an actor.|s
fe004|or somebody's going to do the walking.|s
fe004|or if you talk about an adjective red it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red.|s
fe004|so we used to use the notation with for this.|rt
fe004|and i think that's closest to their second one.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|so i don't yet know i have no commitment as to whether we need it.|s
fe004|it might be|s
fe004|it's the kind of thing that a parser might want to think about whether we require|cs
fe004|you know these things are like it's semantically part of it.|s
me010|no no.|ar
me010|well uh critically they're not required syntactically.|nd
me010|often they're presupposed and all that sort of stuff.|e
fe004|right.|aa
fe004|right right yeah um definitely.|aa
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|in was a good example.|s
fe004|if you walk in like well in what?|df
fe004|you know like you have to have the so so it's only semantically is it|s
me010|right there's|aa
fe004|it is still required say by simulation time though.|s
fe004|to have something.|e
me010|right.|aa
fe004|so it's that i meant the idea of like that the semantic value is filled in by simulation.|s
fe004|i don't know if that's something we need to to to like say ever as part of the requirement.|no
fe004|or the construction.|bsc
fe004|or not.|e
fe004|we'll we'll again defer.|s
me010|or i mean or or uh|%--
me010|so the|%--
fe004|have it construed.|bu
fe004|is that the idea?|rt
me010|yeah yeah.|aa
fe004|just point at robert.|s
fe004|whenever i'm confused just point to him.|s
me010|right.|aa
fe004|you tell me.|s
me010|it's it's his thesis right?|j
fe004|okay.|bk
me010|anyway|fg
me010|right yeah this is going to be a|bk
me010|you're right this is a bit of in a mess.|s
me010|and we still have emphasis as well or stress or whatever.|s
fe004|okay well we'll get uh uh i we have thoughts about those as well.|bk
me010|yeah.|b
me010|great.|ba
fe004|um|fh
fe004|i i would|s
fe004|some of this is just like my you know by fiat.|s
fe004|i'm going to say this is how we use these terms.|s
fe004|i you know there's lots of different ways in the world that people use it.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|i that's fine.|ba
fe004|i think that um the other terms that are related are like focus and stress.|s
fe004|so|%--
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|i think that the way i we would like to think uh i think is focus is something that comes up in i mean lots of|s
fe004|basically this is the information structure.|s
fe004|okay it's like uh it's not it might be that there's a syntactic uh device that you use to indicate focus.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|or that there are things like you know|s
fe004|i think keith was telling me things toward the end of the sentence post verbal tend to be the focused focused element.|s
me045|huh.|b
fe004|the new information.|e
fe004|you know if i i walked into the room you tend to think that whatever into the room is sort of like the more focused kind of thing.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|and when you uh uh you have stress on something that might be you know a cue that the stressed element or for instance the negated element is kind of related to information structure.|s
fe004|so that's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing.|s
fe004|uh so so i think that's kind of nice to keep focus being an information structure term.|s
fe004|stress|%--
fe004|i and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it.|s
fe004|so um like stress stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever like um accent kind of stress.|fh
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and that's just a|s
fe004|uh we'll want to distinguish stress as a form device.|s
fe004|you know like oh high volume or whatever.|e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|uh and distinguish that from it's effect.|s
fe004|which is oh the kind of focus we have is we're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values right.|s
fe004|so focus carries along a scope.|s
fe004|like if you're going to focus on this thing and you want to know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't.|s
fe004|um so my classic my now classic example of saying oh he did go to the meeting.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|that was my way of saying as opposed to you know oh he didn't or there was a meeting.|rt
fe004|i think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|and so um the like if you said he|s
fe004|you know there's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you're focusing whatever on uh|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|he walked to the meeting as opposed to he ran.|s
fe004|or he did walk to the meeting as opposed to he didn't walk you know.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so we need to have a notation for that.|cs
fe004|which um|%--
fe004|i think that's still in progress.|s
fe004|so sort of i'm still working it out.|e
fe004|but it did one one implication it does have for the other side which we'll get to in a minute is that i couldn't think of a good way to say here are the possible things that you could focus on.|s
fe004|because it seems like any entity in any sentence you know or any meaning component of you know all the possible meanings you could have any of them could be the subject of focus.|df
me010|huh.|b
fe004|but i think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus right?|s
fe004|so for instance you could say it's the the tense on this as opposed to um the the action okay.|s
fe004|or it's uh it's an identity thing or a contrast with other things.|s
fe004|or stress this value as opposed to other things.|e
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|it's it is kind of like a profile profile background thing.|s
fe004|but i i can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would that you would|s
me045|light up with focus yeah.|2
fe004|light highlight.|m
fe004|as opposed to other ones.|e
fe004|so it has some certain complications for the uh uh later on.|s
fe004|i mean uh the best thing i can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements.|s
fe004|for instance you oh one other type that i forgot to mention is like query elements.|s
fe004|and that's probably relevant for the like where is you know the castle kind of thing.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|because you might want to say that um location or certain w.h. words bring you know sort of automatically focus in a you know i don't know the identity of this thing kind of way on certain elements.|df
fe004|so|fh
fe004|okay anyway so that's there are there are many more things that are that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation.|fg
fe004|but it's most i think it's this is you know the current current form.|s
fe004|other things we didn't totally deal with um|s
fe004|well we've had a lot of other stuff that keith and i have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective.|s
me045|oh there's a bunch.|ba
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|you know a a nominal expression.|s
fe004|and um|fh
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|i mean we should have put an example of this.|cs
fe004|and we could do that later.|cs
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|but i think the inherently like the general principles still work though.|s
fe004|that um we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like you know for instance one|s
fe004|uh you know they they have constituents right?|s
fe004|so you can like nest things when you need to.|s
fe004|but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way.|s
fe004|so if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience then like this this might you know be a little opaque.|s
fe004|but you know we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent based grammar.|s
fe004|so that's i think that's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and so far it's worked out okay.|s
me010|good.|ba
fe004|so|fh
fe004|okay.|bk
mn015|i can say two things about the|s
fe004|yes.|bk
mn015|maybe you want to forget stress.|cs
mn015|this my|s
fe004|as a word?|bu
mn015|no as as just don't don't think about it.|ar
fe004|as a|%--
fe004|what's that?|j
fe004|sorry.|fa
mn015|if|%--
mn015|canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence you can find out where a certain stress is.|s
mn015|and say hey that's my focus exponent.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|right.|b
mn015|it doesn't tell you anything what the focus is.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|if it's just that thing|s
fe004|or the constituent that it falls in.|s
mn015|a little bit more or the whole phrase.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|um|%--
fe004|you mean forget about stress the form cue?|bu
mn015|the form bit.|na
me045|yeah.|aa
mn015|because uh as a form cue um not even trained experts can always well they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes.|df
fe004|okay.|bk
mn015|and that's also mostly true for read speech.|s
mn015|in in real speech um people may put stress.|s
mn015|it's so context dependent on what was there before phrase breaks um restarts.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|it's just um|s
mn015|it's absurd.|ba
mn015|it's complicated.|e
fe004|okay.|bk
me045|yeah i mean i i'm sort of inclined to say let's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence.|fg
mn015|and all|%--
fe004|i believe you yeah.|na
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and then|s
fe004|ways that you can get it come from|2
me045|hhh the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that.|s
fe004|right.|b
me045|you know i mean later on we'll worry about exactly how|s
mn015|or or map from the contour to to what the focus exponent is.|bu
me045|yeah.|aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|exactly.|aa
me045|but figure out how the|s
me045|yeah.|bk
mn015|but uh if you don't know what you're what you're focus is then you're you're hopeless-uh-ly lost anyways.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|that's fine yeah.|ba
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and the only way of figuring out what that is is um by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and then you're left with a couple three.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so you know again that's something that humans can do.|s
mn015|um but far outside the scope of of any anything.|s
mn015|so|fh
mn015|you know|fh
mn015|it's|%--
fe004|okay well uh yeah i wouldn't have assumed that it's an easy problem in in absence of all the|bk
fe004|you need all the other information i guess.|e
mn015|but it's it's what it uh it's pretty easy to put it in the formalism though.|s
mn015|i mean because|df
fe004|yeah.|bk
mn015|you can just say whatever stuff is the container being focused or the the entire whatever both and so forth.|s
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah exactly so the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture.|aa
me010|yeah so but i think the|fg
me010|i'm not sure i understand.|bd
me010|but here's what i think is going on.|s
me010|that if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches it the fact that it matches does in fact specify the focus.|s
fe004|uh|%--
fe004|i'm not sure about that.|no
fe004|or it might limit it certainly constrains the possibilities of focus.|s
me010|okay.|bk
me010|uh uh at the very least it|na
fe004|i think that's that's that's certainly true.|s
fe004|and depending on the construction it may or may not specify the focus right?|bu
me010|oh uh for sure yes.|na
me010|there are yeah it's not every but there are constructions uh where you explicitly take into account those considerations|s
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so we talked about that a little bit this morning.|s
mn015|john is on the bus.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|not nancy.|s
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|so that's focuses on john.|s
me010|right.|b
mn015|john is on the bus and not on the train.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|john is on the bus versus john is on the train.|s
fe004|right.|b
mn015|and john is on the bus versus was and|s
fe004|is on.|2
fe004|john is on the bus.|na
mn015|it's the so|s
fe004|yeah yeah.|aa
me010|right.|aa
me010|yeah all all of those.|aa
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|right.|b
mn015|all of these.|m
mn015|and will we have|qy
mn015|is it all the same constructions?|rt
mn015|just with a different focus constituent.|e
fe004|yeah i would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of|aa
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|i don't know.|no
fe004|the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions.|s
fe004|so that's why i was talking about overlapping constructions.|rt
fe004|so then you have a separate thing that picks out you know stress on something relative to everything else.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so the question is actually|s
fe004|and it would|s
me010|oh i'm sorry.|fa
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|go ahead.|co
me010|finish.|co
fe004|and it and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as uh whether it picks up that element or the phrase or something like that.|s
fe004|but it's still is limited possibility.|s
mn015|huh.|b
fe004|so that should you know interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|the question is do we have a way on the other page uh when we get to the semantic side of saying what the stressed element was or stressed phrase or something?|qh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|well so that's why i was saying how|s
fe004|since i couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it um all i can say is that information structure has a focused slot.|rt
me010|right.|b
fe004|and i think that should be able to refer to|s
me010|so that's down at the bottom here when we get over there.|s
fe004|yeah.|aa
me010|okay.|bk
fe004|and infer and i don't have i don't have a great way or great examples.|s
me010|i'll wait.|cc
fe004|but i think that something like that is probably going to be uh more more what we have to do.|s
me010|okay.|bk
mn015|huh.|b
fe004|but um|fh
me010|okay.|bk
mn015|so|fh
fe004|okay that was one comment.|fg
fe004|and you had another one?|bu
mn015|yeah well the once you know what the focus is the everything else is background.|aa
mn015|how about topic comment?|qh
mn015|that's the other side of information.|s
fe004|how about what?|br
mn015|topic comment.|rt
fe004|yeah so that was the other thing.|bk
fe004|and so i didn't realize it before.|s
fe004|it's like oh ! it was an epiphany that it you know topic and focus are a contrast set.|s
fe004|so topic is|s
fe004|topic focused seems to me like um background profile okay?|s
fe004|or a landmark trajector or something like that.|s
fe004|there's there's definitely um that kind of thing going on.|s
mn015|huh.|b
fe004|now i don't know whether|no
fe004|i i don't have as many great examples of like topic indicating constructions.|s
fe004|on like focus right?|e
fe004|um topic it seems kind of you know i think that might be an ongoing kind of thing.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me045|japanese has this though.|s
fe004|topic marker?|bu
me045|you know|s
me045|yeah that's what wa is.|aa
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|uh just to mark which thing is the topic.|e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|it doesn't always have to be the subject.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|so again information structure has a topic slot.|s
fe004|and you know i stuck it in thinking that we might use it.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|um i think i stuck it in.|s
me010|yep it's there.|aa
fe004|um and|fh
fe004|one thing that i didn't do consistently um is when we get there is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role.|s
fe004|i think i have an idea of what it should be.|s
fe004|but|%--
fe004|you know so far we've been getting away with like either a type constraint or um you know whatever.|s
fe004|i it'll be a frame.|rt
fe004|you know it'll be it'll be another predication or it'll be um i don't know some value from from something some variable and scope or something like that.|s
fe004|or a slot chain based on a variable and scope.|s
fe004|okay so well that's|fg
fe004|should we flip over to the other side officially then?|rt
mn015|uhhuh huh.|aa
fe004|i keep uh like pointing forward to it.|s
me045|okay side one.|bk
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|now we'll go back to|s
fe004|okay so this doesn't include something which may have some effect on on it.|fg
fe004|which is um the discourse situation context record.|s
fe004|right so i didn't i i meant just like draw a line.|f
fe004|and like you know you also have uh some tracking of what was going on.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|and sort of this is a big scale comment before i you know look into the details of this.|bd
fe004|but for instance you could imagine instead of having|s
fe004|i i changed the name of um it used to be entities.|rt
fe004|so you see it's scenario referent and discourse segment.|s
fe004|and scenario is essentially what kind of what's the basic predication.|s
fe004|what event happened.|e
fe004|and actually it's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture a bunch of frames and bindings right?|s
fe004|um and obviously there are other ones that are not included here.|s
fe004|general cultural frames and general like uh other action|s
fe004|you know specific x. schema frames.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|okay whatever.|bk
fe004|the middle thing used to be entities.|s
fe004|because you could imagine it should be like really a list.|df
fe004|where here was various information.|s
fe004|and this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh you know about some entity that you were going to talk about.|s
fe004|so harry walked into the room.|s
fe004|harry and room.|s
fe004|you know the room|s
fe004|but they would be represented in this list somehow.|s
fe004|and it could also have for instance it has this category slot.|s
fe004|um it should be either category or or instance.|s
fe004|basically it could be a pointer to ontology.|s
fe004|so that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in.|s
fe004|but the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number gender.|s
fe004|um the ones i included here are slightly arbitrary.|s
fe004|but you could imagine that um you need to figure out|s
fe004|if it's a group whether um some event is happening.|s
fe004|linear time linear spaces.|s
fe004|like you know are are they doing something serially.|s
fe004|or is it like|s
fe004|um uh i'm i'm not sure.|fh
fe004|because this partly came from uh talmy's schema.|df
fe004|and i'm not sure we'll need all of these actually.|s
fe004|but|fh
fe004|um and then the status i used was like again in some languages you know like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status.|s
fe004|so the the big and and finally discourse segment is about sort of speech act y information structure y.|s
fe004|like utterance-specific kinds of things.|s
fe004|so the comment i was going to make about um changing entity the entity's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse|s
fe004|like situation context|e
fe004|you have a set of entities that you're sort of referring to.|s
fe004|and you might that might be sort of a general i don't know database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to.|s
fe004|and i changed to reference.|s
fe004|because i would say for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it.|s
fe004|and those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here.|s
fe004|for instance i know it's going to be plural.|s
fe004|i know it's going to be feminine or something like that.|s
fe004|and and these could actually just point to you know the the i.d. in my other list of active entities right?|s
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|uh there's there's all this stuff about discourse status we've talked about.|s
fe004|i almost listed discourse status as a slot where you could say it's active.|s
fe004|you know there's this um hierarchy uh there's a schematization of you know things can be active or they can be um accessible inaccessible.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|it was the one that you know keith um emailed to us once to some of us.|s
fe004|not all of us.|s
fe004|and|fh
fe004|the thing is that that i noticed that that um list was sort of discourse dependent.|s
fe004|it was like in this particular set you know instance it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active.|s
me010|this|%--
me010|uh yeah well there there seems to be context properties.|fg
fe004|so|fh
fe004|yeah they're and for instance i used to have a location thing there.|aa
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|but actually that's a property of the situation.|s
fe004|and it's again time you know at certain points things are located you know near or far from you.|s
me010|well uh uh this is recursive.|nd
fe004|and|%--
me010|because until we do the uh mental space story we're not quite sure|df
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|which is fine.|ba
fe004|yeah yeah.|bk
me010|we'll just we'll|s
fe004|so some of these are uh|s
me010|we just don't know yet.|no
fe004|right.|bk
fe004|so i so for now i thought well maybe i'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance right?|s
fe004|everything else here is utterance-specific.|s
fe004|um and i left the slot predications open.|s
fe004|because you can have um things like the guy i know from school.|df
fe004|or you know like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded amounts of you know predications that you might make.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and it's unclear whether|s
fe004|i mean you could just have in your scenario here are some extra few things that are true right?|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and then you could just sort of not have this slot here right?|s
fe004|you're but but it's used for identification purposes.|s
fe004|so it's it's a little bit different from just saying all these things are true from my utterance.|s
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|right.|aa
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um|fh
me045|right this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean um there's a guy i know him from school.|fg
me045|and he came over for dinner.|s
me045|that's not the same effect.|s
fe004|yeah it's a little bit it's a little bit different.|aa
fe004|right so|f
fe004|or maybe that's like a restrictive non restrictive|s
fe004|you know it's like it gets into that kind of thing for|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um but maybe i'm mixing you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence.|s
fe004|so you might imagine that the information you pass to you know in identifying a particular referent would be oh some you know it's a guy.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and it's someone i know from school.|s
fe004|so maybe that would you know be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the to the whatever construal engine or whatever discourse context to find you know either create this reference.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|in which case it'd be created here.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and|fh
fe004|you know so so you could imagine that this might not|s
fe004|so uh i'm uncommitted to a couple of these things.|s
mn015|but to make it precise at least in my mind uh it's not precise.|s
fe004|um|fh
mn015|so house is gender neuter?|rt
fe004|um it could be in|h
mn015|in reality?|d
mn015|or in|qrr
me010|semantically.|s
fe004|semantically yeah yeah.|m
mn015|semantically.|bk
mn015|so|%--
fe004|so it uh uh a table.|s
fe004|you know a thing that doesn't have a gender.|s
fe004|so uh it could be that i mean|fg
fe004|maybe you'd maybe not all these|s
fe004|i mean i i would say that i tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things.|s
mn015|no just to make sure that we everybody that's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with uh form.|ar
fe004|yeah.|bk
fe004|okay that is semantic as opposed to|bk
fe004|yeah yeah that's right.|aa
fe004|um|fh
fe004|so again|%--
mn015|then predications makes sense to to have it open for something like uh accessibility or not.|s
fe004|open to various things.|2
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|right.|b
fe004|okay so let's see.|bk
fe004|so maybe having made that big sort of like large scale comment should i just go through each of these slots uh each of these blocks um a little bit?|rt
me045|sure.|aa
fe004|um mostly the top one is sort of image schematic.|s
fe004|and just a note.|s
fe004|which was that um|s
fe004|so when we actually|s
fe004|so for instance um|s
fe004|some of them seem more inherently static okay.|s
fe004|like a container or sort of support-ish.|s
fe004|and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic.|s
fe004|like source path goal is often thought of that way.|s
fe004|or force or something like that.|s
fe004|but in actual fact i think that they're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that.|s
fe004|and different x. schemas use them in a way that's either static or dynamic.|s
fe004|so path you could just be talking about the path between this and this.|s
me045|huh.|b
fe004|and you know container that you can go in and out.|s
fe004|all of these things.|s
fe004|and so um|fh
fe004|i think this came up when uh ben and i were working with the spaniards um the other day.|s
fe004|the spaniettes as we called them.|bsc
fe004|um to decide like how you want to split up like image schematic contributions versus like x. schematic contributions.|s
fe004|how do you link them up?|e
fe004|and i think again um it's going to be something in the x. schema that tells you is this static or is this dynamic.|s
fe004|so we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that.|cs
fe004|um that you know is it uh a state or is it a change of state or is it a um action of some kind.|fg
mn015|uh is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't?|qy
fe004|uh|fh
fe004|yeah.|bk
mn015|just means|%--
fe004|oh oh you mean in the slot?|bk
mn015|uhhuh.|aa
fe004|um no it's like x. it's it's like i was thinking of type constraints.|ar
fe004|but x. schema well it obviously has to be an x. schema.|s
fe004|agent i mean the the performer of the x. schema.|s
fe004|that depends on the x. schema.|s
fe004|you know and i in general it would probably be you know|s
me045|so the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were.|bu
fe004|yeah basically.|aa
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me045|okay.|bk
fe004|um aspectual type probably isn't obvious.|bd
fe004|but i should have so i just neglected to stick something in perspective actor undergoer observer um|df
me003|huh.|b
fe004|i think we've often used agent patient|s
me045|whee!|fe
me045|that's that one right?|bu
fe004|yeah exactly exactly.|aa
fe004|um and so one nice thing that uh we had talked about is this example of like if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is you know definitely it is one way to for you to you know specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object.|fh
fe004|and so then we talked about you know whether well does that specify topic as well?|qh
fe004|well maybe there are other things.|s
fe004|you know now that it's subject is more like a topic.|s
fe004|and now that you know|s
fe004|anyway so|fg
fe004|sorry i'm going to trail off on that one.|fa
fe004|because it's not that important right now.|df
fe004|um|fh
me010|now for the moment we just need the ability to write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules were.|s
fe004|to know how|2
fe004|yeah yeah exactly.|aa
me010|yeah.|bk
fe004|um|fh
fe004|some of these other ones|s
fe004|let's see.|s
fe004|so|fh
fe004|uh one thing i'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts.|s
fe004|so polarity uh is using for like action did not take place for instance.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so by default it'll be like true i guess.|s
fe004|you know if you're specifying events that did happen.|s
fe004|you could imagine that you skip out this you know leave off this polarity.|s
fe004|you know not don't have it here.|s
fe004|and then have it part of the speech act in some way.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|there's some negation.|s
fe004|but the reason why i left it in is because you might have a change of state let's say where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold.|s
fe004|and you're just talking you know|s
fe004|if you're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that you know whatever the holder doesn't and|s
me010|no i i think at this which is it should be where you have it.|ar
fe004|okay it's so it's it's it's fine where it is.|bk
fe004|so|fh
me010|i mean how you get it may may will often involve the discourse.|e
fe004|okay.|bk
fe004|may come from a few places.|2
me010|but but by the time you're simulating you you should know that.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|right.|bk
me045|so i'm still just really not clear on what i'm looking at.|rt
me045|the scenario box.|rt
me045|like what does that look like for an example?|qh
fe004|yeah.|aa
me045|like not all of these things are going to be here.|df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|correct.|aa
me045|this is just basically says|s
fe004|it's a grab bag of|s
me045|part of what i'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of uh schemas image and x. schemas.|s
me045|here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there.|s
fe004|so that's exactly what it is.|na
me045|okay.|bk
fe004|and for a particular instance which i will you know make an example of something is that you might have an instance of container and path let's say as part of your you know into you know definition.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so you would eventually have instances filled in with various various values for all the different slots.|rt
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and they're bound up in you know their bindings and and and values.|s
me045|okay.|bk
me010|it|%--
me045|do you have to say about the binding in your|qy
me045|is there a slot in here for that tells you how the bindings are done?|rt
me010|no no no.|ar
me010|i let's see i think we're we're not.|s
me010|i don't think we have it quite right yet.|no
me045|okay.|bk
me010|so uh what this is|s
me010|let's suppose for the moment it's complete.|s
me045|okay.|bk
me010|okay uh then this says that when an analysis is finished the whole analysis is finished you'll have as a result uh some resulting semspec for that utterance in context.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|which is made up entirely of these things and uh bindings among them.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and bindings to ontology items.|e
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that that the that this is the tool kit under out of which you can make a semantic specification.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that's a. .|s
me045|okay.|b
me010|but b. which is more relevant to your life is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so this is that anything you have in the party line anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes from pieces of this ignoring|s
me045|okay.|b
me010|i mean in general you ignore lots of it.|s
me045|right.|b
me010|but it's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them.|s
me045|okay.|bk
me010|uh so that the you know goal of the uh uh source path goal has to be the landmark of the you know the interior of this container.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|or whatever.|e
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so those constraints appear in constructions.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you.|s
me045|okay.|bk
fe004|except for cause that i forgot.|arp
fe004|but anyway there's some kind of causal structure for composite events.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|okay good.|bk
me010|let's let's mark that.|co
me010|so we need a|s
fe004|uh i mean so it gets a little funny.|s
fe004|these are all so far these structures especially from path and on down these are sort of relatively familiar um image schematic kind of slots.|s
fe004|now with cause uh the fillers will actually be themselves frames right?|s
fe004|so you'll say event one causes event b. .|s
me010|right.|aa
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and and and and this this this again may our um and we and and of course worlds.|s
fe004|uh event two|s
fe004|and|%--
fe004|yeah so that's uh these are all implicitly one within uh within one world.|aa
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|even though saying that place takes place whatever.|s
fe004|uh if if i said time is you know past that would say set that this world you know somewhere before the world that corresponds to our current speech time.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so but that that that's sort of okay.|fh
fe004|the the within the event it's it's still one world.|s
fe004|um|fh
fe004|yeah so cause and|fg
fe004|other frames that could come in i mean unfortunately you could bring in say for instance um uh desire or something like that.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|like want.|e
fe004|and actually there is right now under discourse segments um attitude.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|volition.|rt
fe004|could fill that.|s
fe004|so there are a couple things where i like oh i'm not sure if i wanted to have it there.|rt
me045|well that's|%--
fe004|or basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say talmy listed.|s
fe004|and like well i don't you know it was like hope wish desire.|s
me010|right.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|blah blah blah.|e
fe004|and it's like well i feel like if i wanted to have an extra meaning|s
fe004|i don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place.|no
fe004|so they're more lexically marked right?|s
fe004|at least in english.|e
me045|huh.|b
fe004|so if i wanted to i would stick in an extra frame in my meaning saying.|s
fe004|so it'd be a hierarchical frame them right?|s
fe004|you know like naomi wants wants a certain situation.|s
fe004|and that situation itself is a state of affairs.|s
me010|right.|aa
me010|so so want itself can be|s
fe004|can be just another frame that's part of your.|2
me010|well and basically it's an action.|s
me010|in in our in our in our|e
fe004|yeah.|aa
fe004|situation right right.|2
me010|in in our in our terminology want can be an action.|s
me010|and what you want is a world.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|huh.|b
fe004|huh.|b
me010|so that's i mean it's certainly one way to do it.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|yeah there there are other things.|fh
me010|causal stuff we absolutely need.|s
me010|mental space we need.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|the context we need.|s
me010|um so anyway keith|fh
me010|so is this comfortable to you?|qy
me010|that uh once we have this defined it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions.|e
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and then when we combine constructions semantically the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one.|e
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|and that's the and and i mean that according to the party line that's the whole story.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|bk
me045|um|fh
me045|right that makes sense.|aa
me045|so i mean there's this stuff in the off in the scenario.|s
me045|which just tells you how various what schemas you're using.|s
me045|and they're how they're bound together.|s
me045|and i guess that some of the discourse segment stuff|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|is that where you would|qy
me045|i mean that's|s
me045|okay that's where the information structure is.|bk
me045|which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of um of this.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|exactly.|aa
me045|i mean what's interesting is that the information structure stuff|s
me045|huh.|ba
me045|there's almost i mean we keep coming back to how focus is like this this uh trajector-landmark thing.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|so if i say um you know in france it's like this.|s
me045|you know great.|s
me045|we've learned something about france.|e
me045|but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast.|s
me045|like in france it's like this.|s
fe004|right.|b
me045|and therefore you're supposed to say boy life sure|s
me045|you know in france kids are allowed to drink at age three.|s
me045|and you're that's not just a fact about france.|s
fe004|right right.|b
me045|you also conclude something about how boring it is here in the u.s. right?|s
me010|right.|bk
me045|and so|fh
fe004|so i would prefer not to worry about that for right now.|bd
me045|okay.|bk
fe004|and to think that there are um|s
me045|that comes in.|s
fe004|discourse level constructions in a sense topic topic focus constructions that would say oh when you focus something then|s
me045|and uh|%--
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|just done the same way just actually in the same way as the lower level.|s
fe004|if you stressed you know john went to the you know the bar whatever you're focusing that.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and a possible inference is in contrast to other things.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so similarly for a whole sentence you know in france such and such happens.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah yeah.|b
fe004|so the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible.|s
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|uh just just uh look read uh even semi formal mats rooth.|s
fe004|i mean|%--
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|if you haven't read it it's nice.|s
mn015|and just pick any paper on alternative semantics.|cs
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|okay.|bk
mn015|so that's his that's the best way of talking about focus is i think his way.|s
me045|okay what was the name?|bk
mn015|mats.|s
mn015|m.a.t.s.|rt
me045|okay.|bk
mn015|rooth.|s
mn015|i think two o. 's.|s
mn015|yes t.h.|aa
me045|okay.|bk
mn015|i never know how to pronounce his name.|s
mn015|because he's sort of|df
me010|swede?|2
mn015|uh he is dutch.|s
me010|dutch?|br
me045|yeah.|bk
me010|oh dutch.|bk
mn015|and um but very confused background i think.|fh
me010|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so and um|fh
me045|mats gould.|s
mn015|and sadly enough he also just left the i.m.s. in stuttgart.|s
mn015|so he's not there anymore.|s
me045|huh.|b
mn015|but um|fh
mn015|i don't know where he is right now.|no
mn015|but alternative semantics is if you type that into an uh uh browser or search engine you'll get tons of stuff.|s
me045|okay.|b
me045|okay.|bk
me045|okay thanks.|bk
mn015|and what i'm kind of confused about is is what the speaker and the hearer is is sort of doing there.|tc
fe004|so for a particular segment it's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation right?|s
fe004|so for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|um hearer is a little bit harder.|ba
fe004|it could be like multiple people.|s
fe004|i guess that that that that's not very clear from here.|s
fe004|i mean that's not allowed here.|s
mn015|yeah but you don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place?|bk
mn015|because you me he they.|df
mn015|you know these guys|s
mn015|all these expressions nuh are in in much the same way contextually dependent as here and now and there.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|now this is this is assuming you've already solved that.|s
fe004|yeah.|aa
me010|so it's it's fred and mary.|s
fe004|so|%--
me010|so the speaker would be fred.|s
me010|and the|%--
mn015|uh.|bk
fe004|right so the constructions might of course will refer using pronouns or whatever.|aa
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|in which case they have to check to see uh who the uh speaker in here in order to resolve those.|s
fe004|but when you actually say that he walked into whatever um the he will refer to a particular|s
fe004|you you will already have figured who he or you huh or i maybe is a better example who i refers to.|s
fe004|um and then you'd just be able to refer to harry you know in wherever that person whatever role that person was playing in the event.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|that's up at the reference part.|bu
fe004|yeah yeah.|aa
mn015|and down there in the speaker-hearer part?|rt
fe004|so that's i think that's just|s
fe004|for instance speaker is known from the situation right?|s
fe004|you're when you hear something you're told who the speaker is.|s
fe004|i mean you know who the speaker is.|s
fe004|in fact that's kind of constraining how|s
fe004|in some ways you know this before you get to the you fill in all the rest of it.|s
fe004|i think.|s
me010|huh.|b
fe004|i mean how else would you um|df
mn015|you know uh uh it's the speaker may in english is allowed to say i.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|well here|%--
fe004|yeah.|b
mn015|uh among the twenty five percent most used words.|e
fe004|right.|bk
mn015|but wouldn't the i then set up the the referent?|qh
fe004|uhhuh.|aa
mn015|that happens to be the speaker this time.|e
fe004|right right.|aa
mn015|and not they whoever they are.|e
fe004|so|%--
mn015|or you|%--
mn015|much like the you could|s
fe004|so okay so i would say under referent should be something that corresponds to i.|fg
fe004|and maybe each referent should probably have a list of whatever the way it was referred to.|s
fe004|so that's i.|s
fe004|but uh uh should we say it it refers to what?|qh
fe004|uh if it were harry it would refer to like some ontology thing.|s
fe004|if it were if it's i it would refer to the current speaker.|s
fe004|okay which is given to be like you know whoever it is.|s
mn015|well not not always.|nd
mn015|i mean so there's and then he said i uhhuh|s
fe004|i within the current world.|df
me010|uh|%--
mn015|yeah.|aa
me010|yeah.|b
me010|that's right.|na
fe004|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|aa
me010|so so again this uh this this is going to to get us into the mental space stuff.|fg
me010|and because you know fred said that mary said and whatever.|df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|huh.|b
me010|and and so we're uh going to have to um chain those as well.|cs
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|twhhh-whhh.|b
mn015|but|fh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so this entire thing is inside a world.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|not just like the top part.|e
me010|right.|aa
me010|i i think uh|%--
fe004|that's|%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|except it's it's trickier than that.|arp
me010|because um the reference for example|df
me010|so where it gets really tricky is there's some things|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|and this is where blends and all|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|so some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't.|s
fe004|right.|b
me010|and again all we need for the moment is some way to say that.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|so i thought of having like for each referent having the list of of the things with which it is identified.|s
fe004|you know which which uh you know you you you|s
me010|you could do that.|am
fe004|for instance um|s
fe004|so i guess|s
fe004|it sort of depends on if it is a referring if it's identifiable already or it's a new thing.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|if it's a new thing you'd have to like create a structure or whatever.|s
fe004|if it's an old thing it could be referring to um usually something in a situation right.|s
fe004|or something in ontology.|e
me010|uhhuh.|ba
fe004|so|fh
fe004|there's you know whatever it it could point at one of these.|s
me010|i just had a i just had an an idea that would be very nice if it works.|s
fe004|for what?|br
fe004|if it works.|s
me010|uh uh uh i haven't told you what it is yet.|s
fe004|uhhuh huh.|bk
me010|this was my buildup.|df
me010|an an idea that would be nice|s
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|okay we're crossing our fingers.|bk
me010|right.|bk
me010|if it worked.|s
me003|so we're building a mental space good.|j
me010|yeah.|aa
fe004|okay.|bk
me010|right it was a space builder.|aa
me010|um we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces.|fh
me010|because uh you have somewhat the same things going on of uh things being accessible or not.|df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and so|%--
fe004|yep.|aa
me010|it it it uh i think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure.|s
fe004|use the same yep.|2
me010|so that pulling something out of a discourse context is i think similar to other kinds of uh mental space phenomena.|s
me003|i see.|bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and|%--
me010|uh i've i've i've never seen anybody write that up.|df
fe004|and|%--
me010|but maybe they did.|ba
me010|i don't know.|no
me010|that may be all over the literature.|s
fe004|yeah.|bk
fe004|so so by default|s
me045|there's things like you know there's all kinds of stuff like um in i think i mentioned last time in czech if you have a a verb of saying then|s
me045|um you know you say something like or or i was thinking you can say something like oh i thought uh you are a republican or something like that.|s
me045|where as in english you would say i thought you were.|s
me010|right.|b
me045|um you know sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there.|s
me045|so you have to say something about you know tense is determined relative to current blah blah blah.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|same things happens with pronouns.|s
me045|there's languages where um|s
me045|if you have a verb of saying then|s
me045|uh|%--
me045|where|%--
me045|okay so a situation like bob said he was going to the movies where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking you're actually required to have i there.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|um and it's sort of in an extended function|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
me010|so we would have it be in quotes in english.|s
me045|yeah.|aa
fe004|right.|b
me003|right.|b
me045|but it's not perceived as a quotative construction.|s
me045|i mean it's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing right?|e
fe004|oh right yeah that makes sense.|aa
me010|okay.|b
me045|um|fh
me045|but uh that happens to sound like the word for i.|rt
me045|but is actually semantically unrelated to it.|rt
fe004|oh no!|fe
me010|oh good i love the|ba
me045|um|fh
fe004|really?|bh
me045|yeah yeah.|aa
fe004|you're kidding.|s
me045|there's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption.|s
me045|uh mary dalrymple.|e
me045|uh this book a ninety three book on uh on pronoun stuff.|s
fe004|no that's horrible.|ar
fe004|okay.|bk
fe004|that's horrible okay.|ba
me045|well yeah and then the same thing for a.s.l.|fh
me045|where you know you're signing.|s
me045|and someone says something.|s
me045|and then you know so he say and then you sort of do a role shift.|s
me045|and then you sign i this that and the other.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|rt
me045|and you know i did this.|s
me045|that's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with i.|s
me045|and the role shift thing is completely left out and so on.|s
me045|so|fh
me045|i mean the point is that pronoun references uh you know sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on and so forth.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and so yeah i mean|s
fe004|yeah.|bk
me010|so that that that does sound like it's consistent with what we're saying yeah.|s
me045|right.|aa
me045|yeah.|aa
fe004|okay so it's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context.|bk
fe004|and then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the you know depending on the construction or the whatever um you you you're scope is might extend out to the the base one.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|it would be nice to actually use the same um mechanism.|cs
fe004|since there are so many cases where you actually need|df
fe004|it'll be one or the other.|e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|it's like oh actually it's the same same operation.|s
me010|oh okay so this this is worth some thought.|bk
fe004|so|fh
me045|it's like it's like what's happening that yeah what's happening uh there is that you're moving the base space or something like that right?|s
fe004|yeah yeah.|aa
me045|so that's that's how fauconnier would talk about it.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and it happens under different circumstances in different languages.|s
me045|and so|fh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|um things like pronoun reference and tense which we're thinking of as being these discourse y things actually are relative to a bayes space.|s
me045|which can change.|e
fe004|uhhuh.|bk
me045|and we need all the same machinery.|cs
fe004|right.|bk
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|robert.|s
me010|well but uh this is very good actually.|ba
me045|schade.|s
me010|because it it it to the extent that it works it|df
fe004|ties it all into it.|2
me010|it it ties together several of of these things.|m
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|yep.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and i'm sure going to read the transcript of this one.|j
mn015|so|fh
mn015|but the uh but it's too bad that we don't have a camera.|s
mn015|you know all the pointing is going to be lost.|df
fe004|oh yeah.|bk
me045|yeah.|aa
fe004|yeah that's why i said point to robert when i did it.|fg
me003|well every time nancy giggles it means it means that it's your job.|j
mn015|uh|fh
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|huh isn't i mean i'm i was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality you know as your basic mental space.|ba
mn015|and then builds up|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|doesn't start with some because it's so it should be so obvious at least it is to me that whenever i say something i could preface that with i think.|df
me045|yeah.|aa
mn015|nuh?|d
mn015|so there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue.|s
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|no but there's there's a gricean thing going on there.|ar
me010|that when you say i think you're actually hedging.|s
fe004|huh.|b
me045|yeah i mean|aa
fe004|it's like i don't totally think.|s
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|right.|aa
fe004|i mostly think uh|e
mn015|yeah it's absolutely.|aa
me045|yeah it's an it's an evidential.|aa
me045|it's sort of semi-grammaticalized.|s
me045|people have talked about it this way.|s
me045|and you know you can do sort of special things.|s
me045|you can|s
me045|put just the phrase i think as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on and so forth.|s
fe004|actually one of the child language researchers who works with tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions.|s
mn015|yeah.|bk
me045|so|fh
fe004|and it was like it's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways.|s
fe004|just to mark you know uncertainty or something like that.|e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so|fh
mn015|yeah but about linguistic hedges.|fg
mn015|i mean those those tend to be um funky anyways.|s
mn015|because they blur|df
me010|so we don't have that in here either do we?|bu
me045|yeah.|ar
fe004|hedges?|br
me010|yeah yeah.|aa
fe004|hhh i there used to be a slot for speaker um|h
fe004|it was something like factivity.|rt
fe004|i couldn't really remember what it meant.|df
fe004|so i took it out.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|but it's something|s
me045|um|fg
me045|well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that right?|s
fe004|we we were talking about sarcasm too right?|s
fe004|oh oh.|bk
me045|i mean|%--
fe004|oh yeah yeah right.|aa
me045|that's what i think is.|s
me045|um sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this.|e
me010|so we probably should.|cs
fe004|yeah.|aa
me045|or the you know|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|confidence or something like that.|s
me045|yeah.|aa
me045|and the fact that i'm you know the fact maybe if i think it versus he thinks that might you know depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever.|s
fe004|yeah.|bk
me045|you know|fh
mn015|uh great word in the english language is called about.|tc
mn015|if you study how people use that it's also|s
fe004|what's the word?|rt
mn015|about.|s
me010|about.|bk
mn015|it's about|s
me010|oh that in that use of about yeah.|s
mn015|clever.|ba
fe004|oh oh oh as a hedge.|bk
me045|yeah.|b
me010|and i think and i think if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get george started on that.|j
me045|he wrote a paper about thirty five years ago on that one.|s
me003|i i read that paper.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me003|the hedges paper?|bu
me045|yeah.|aa
me003|i read some of that paper actually.|s
me045|would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti-lock brakes?|qy
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|what?|br
me010|no.|ar
me045|ask me about it later.|co
me045|i'll tell you how.|cc
me045|when we're not on tape.|e
fe004|i'd love to know.|s
me003|oh man.|ba
fe004|so and and i think uh someone had raised like sarcasm as a complication at some point.|s
me010|there's all that stuff.|na
me010|yeah let's i i don't i think|fg
fe004|and|fh
fe004|we just won't deal with sarcastic people.|s
me010|yeah i mean|aa
me045|i don't really know what like|no
me045|we we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude right?|s
me045|like there's not so many different|s
fe004|certainly not as some|na
me045|hhh i don't know|fh
fe004|well they're intonational markers i think for the most part.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|i don't know too much about the like grammatical|%--
me045|i just mean|%--
me045|there's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify and so on and so forth.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|but like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes?|qh
me010|right.|aa
me010|right so uh this this raises the question of what are our current purposes?|aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|right?|d
fe004|oh yeah do we have any?|aa
me045|oh shoot.|ba
me045|here it is three fifteen already.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|uh so um|fh
me010|i i don't know the answer.|no
me010|but but um it does seem that|s
me010|you know this is this is coming along.|s
me010|i think it's it's converging.|s
me010|it's as far as i can tell there's this one major thing we have to do.|s
me010|which is the mental the whole mental space thing.|s
me010|and then there's some other minor things.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|um and we're going to have to sort of bound the complexity.|s
me010|i mean if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know we'll go nuts.|df
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|so we had started with the idea that the actual uh constraint was related to this tourist domain.|s
me010|and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain|s
me010|assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to|s
me010|you know there's all sorts of god knows irony and stuff like|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|which you isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide.|s
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|yeah?|d
me010|uh|fh
fe004|mockery.|s
me010|right.|aa
me010|whatever.|bd
me010|so|fg
me010|uh no end of things that that you know we don't deal with.|s
mn015|but it|%--
me010|and|fh
me010|go ahead.|co
mn015|isn't that part easy though?|qy
mn015|because in terms of the simspec it would just mean you put one more set of brackets around it.|df
mn015|and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony.|e
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|no.|ar
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|or|%--
me045|right.|aa
me010|no.|ar
fe004|maybe.|am
fe004|yeah in model theory because the semantics is always like speaker believes.|fg
me010|no.|ar
fe004|you know?|d
fe004|like the speaker says p. and believes not p..|s
me010|right.|b
me045|we have a theoretical model of sarcasm now.|na
fe004|but|fh
me045|yeah right i mean|bk
fe004|right right but|aa
me010|right.|aa
me010|no no.|s
me010|anyway so so um i guess|fg
me010|uh let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that.|s
me010|which is that um|s
me010|it was keith's uh sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions.|s
me010|uh and my suggestion to keith is that you over the next couple weeks|fh
me045|huh.|b
me010|don't try to do them in detail or formally.|s
me010|but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have.|cs
me045|okay.|bk
me010|uh and then when robert gets back we'll look at the set of them.|s
me045|okay.|bk
me010|just just sort of you know define your space.|cs
me045|yeah okay.|bk
me010|and um so these are this is a set of things that i think we ought to deal with.|fh
me045|yeah.|bk
me010|and then we'll we'll we'll go back over it.|rt
me010|and people will will give feedback on it.|s
me045|okay.|b
me010|and then then we'll have a at least initial spec of of what we're actually trying to do.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|and that'll also be useful for anybody who's trying to write a parser.|df
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|knowing uh|%--
me045|in case there's any around.|bd
fe004|if we knew anybody like that.|bd
me010|right.|aa
me010|who might|e
me010|et cetera.|s
me010|so uh|fh
me045|okay.|b
me010|so and we get this this uh portals fixed.|s
me010|and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range.|s
me010|and then of course nancy you're going to have to uh do your set of|s
me010|but you have to do that anyway.|bd
fe004|for the same yeah data yeah uhhuh.|na
me010|so so we're going to get we're basically dealing with two domains.|s
me010|the tourist domain and the and the child language learning.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|and we'll see what we need for those two.|rt
me010|and then my proposal would be to um not totally cut off more general discussion.|cs
me010|but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we've we really want to get done.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and then as a kind of separate thread think about the more general things and and all that.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|well i also think the detailed discussion will hit you know bring us to problems that are of a general nature.|df
me010|uh without doubt.|na
mn015|and maybe even|s
fe004|yeah.|aa
me010|yeah.|aa
me010|but what i want to do is is is to to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for.|df
mn015|even suggest some solutions.|e
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|huh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that that we say these are the things we're really going to try do by the end of the summer.|df
me010|and other things we'll put on a list of of research problems or something.|s
me010|because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done.|df
me010|because every time you start to do something you say oh yeah but what about this case.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|this is this is called being a linguist.|j
mn015|huh.|b
me045|yeah.|aa
me010|and uh|fh
me045|basically.|na
fe004|or me.|na
me010|huh?|br
fe004|or me.|r
fe004|anyways.|bd
me003|there's that quote in jurafsky and martin where where it goes where some guy goes every time i fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|yeah.|bk
me045|exactly.|bk
me010|right.|b
me010|but anyway|bd
me010|so is is that does that make sense as a uh a general way to proceed?|qy
fe004|sure yeah.|aa
me045|yeah yeah we'll start with that.|aa
me045|just figuring out what needs to be done.|s
me045|then actually the next step is to start trying to do it.|s
me010|exactly right.|na
me045|got it.|bk
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|huh.|b
me045|okay.|bk
mn015|we have a little bit of news uh just minor stuff.|rt
mn015|the one big|s
me003|ooo can i ask a|fg
me045|you ran out of power.|s
mn015|huh?|br
me003|can i ask a quick question about this side?|qy
fe004|yes.|aa
mn015|yeah.|aa
me003|is this uh was it intentional to leave off things like inherits?|qy
me003|and|fh
fe004|oops.|fa
fe004|um|h
me045|no.|ar
fe004|not really.|nd
fe004|just on the constructions right?|bu
me003|yeah.|aa
fe004|um|fh
me003|like constructions can inherit from other things.|bu
me003|am i right?|rt
fe004|yeah.|aa
me003|yeah.|bk
fe004|i didn't want to think too much about that for for now.|s
me003|okay.|bk
fe004|so uh maybe it was subconsciously intentional.|rt
me010|yeah.|b
me010|yeah uh|fg
me045|um yeah there should be i i wanted to find out someday if there was going to be some way of dealing with uh if this is the right term multiple inheritance.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|where one construction is inheriting from uh from both parents.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|aa
fe004|yep.|aa
me045|uh or different ones.|e
me045|or three or four different ones.|e
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|because the problem is that then you have to|df
me010|so let me|s
fe004|refer to them.|2
me045|which of you know which are how they're getting bound together.|e
me010|yeah right right right.|aa
fe004|yeah and and there are certainly cases like that.|aa
me010|yeah yeah yeah.|aa
fe004|even with just semantic schemas we have some examples.|s
me010|right.|bk
fe004|so|fh
fe004|and we've been talking a little bit about that anyway.|s
me010|yeah so what i would like to do is separate that problem out.|fg
fe004|inherits.|s
me010|so um|fh
me045|okay.|bk
me010|my argument is there's nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more constructions.|s
me045|yeah yes.|bk
me010|it's uglier and it doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff.|ba
me045|that's right.|aa
me010|uh|fh
me045|but whatever.|bd
fe004|uh those are over rated.|na
me045|yeah no no no no.|aa
me010|right.|aa
me045|no by all means.|aa
me045|right uh sure.|bk
me010|and so i what i'd like to do is is in the short run focus on getting it right.|s
me010|and when we think we have it right then saying aha.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|can we make it more elegant?|qh
me045|yeah that's|bk
me045|yeah.|b
me010|can can we uh what are the generalizations and stuff?|e
me045|connect the dots.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|but rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we're doing.|df
me045|yep.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so i would say in the short run we're not going to|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|first of all we're not doing them yet at all.|s
me010|and and it could be that half way through we say aha.|s
me010|we we now see how we want to clean it up.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh and inheritance is only one i mean that's one way to organize it.|fh
me010|but there are others.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|and it may or may not be the best way.|s
me010|i'm sorry.|fa
me010|you had news.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|oh just small stuff.|bk
mn015|um thanks to eva on our web site we can now|fh
mn015|if you want to run javabayes uh you could see get download these classes.|rt
mn015|and then it will enable you|s
mn015|she modified the gui so it has now a a a button menu item for saving it into the embedded javabayes format.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
me003|huh.|b
mn015|so that's wonderful.|ba
me010|great.|ba
mn015|and um and she you tested it out.|s
mn015|do you want to say something about that that it works right?|qy
fn050|i was just checking like when we want to um get the posterior probability of like variables.|rt
mn015|with the|%--
fn050|you know how you asked whether we can like just observe all the variables like in the same list?|d
fn050|you can't.|s
fn050|you have to make separate queries every time.|df
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|okay that's that's a bit unfortunate.|bk
fn050|so|fh
fn050|yeah.|b
mn015|but|fh
mn015|for the time being it's it's it's fine to do it|s
fn050|you just have to have a long list of you know all the variables.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
fn050|basically.|e
mn015|but uh|fh
fe004|uh all the things you want to query you just have to like ask for separately.|bu
fn050|yeah yeah.|aa
mn015|well that's probably maybe in the long term that's good news.|s
mn015|because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how how we want to get an output.|df
mn015|um but that's a different discussion for a different time.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|i don't know.|no
mn015|we're really running late.|s
mn015|so i had uh an idea yesterday.|s
mn015|but uh i don't know whether we should even start discussing.|no
me010|what|%--
me010|yeah sure tell us what it is.|aa
mn015|um the construal bit that um has been pointed to but hasn't been um made precise by any means um may may work as follows.|h
mn015|i thought that we would uh|s
mn015|that the following thing would be incredibly nice.|df
mn015|and i have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing.|df
mn015|so that's just a tangent a couple of mental disclaimers here.|s
mn015|um imagine you you write a bayes-net.|fh
mn015|um|fh
fe004|bayes?|br
mn015|bayes-net.|m
fe004|okay.|bk
mn015|um completely from scratch every time you do construal.|s
mn015|so you have nothing.|s
mn015|just a white piece of paper.|s
me010|huh.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|you consult consult your ontology.|s
mn015|which will tell you a bunch of stuff and parts and properties uhuh uh|s
fe004|grout out the things that that you need.|2
me010|right.|aa
mn015|then you'd simply write uh these into onto your your white piece of paper.|s
mn015|and you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there.|s
mn015|you won't get you won't really get any c.p.t.'s.|df
mn015|therefore we need everything that that configures to what the situation is.|s
mn015|i.e. the context dependent stuff.|s
mn015|so you get whatever comes from discourse.|rt
mn015|but also filtered.|s
mn015|uh so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse.|rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|plus the situation and the user model.|s
mn015|and that fills in your c.p.t.'s with which you can then query um the the net that you just wrote.|s
mn015|and find out how thing x. is construed as an utterance u. .|s
mn015|and the embedded javabayes works exactly like that.|s
mn015|that once you|s
mn015|we have you know precise format in which to write it.|rt
mn015|so we write it down.|s
mn015|you query it.|s
mn015|you get the result.|s
mn015|and you throw it away.|s
mn015|and the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it.|s
mn015|you may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what so that will allow you to craft the the the initial notes.|s
mn015|but it's in that respect it's completely scalable.|s
mn015|because it doesn't have any prior um configuration.|df
mn015|it's just you need an ontology of the domain.|s
mn015|and you need the context dependent modules.|s
mn015|and if this can be made to work at all that'd be kind of funky.|s
me010|um it sounds to me like you want p.r.m.'s.|fg
mn015|p.r. uh p.r.|s
mn015|i mean since you can unfold a p.r.m. into a straightforward bayes-net.|df
me010|because it because|df
me010|no no you can't.|ar
me010|see the the critical thing about the p.r.m. is it gives these relations in general form.|s
me010|so once you have instantiated the p.r.m. with the instances and then you can then you can unfold it.|s
mn015|then you can.|2
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|bk
mn015|no i was using it generic.|ar
mn015|so uh probabilistic whatever relational models|s
mn015|whatever you write it|s
me010|well no but it matters a lot.|s
mn015|in|%--
me010|because you what you want are these generalized rules.|df
me010|about the way things relate|e
me010|that you then instantiate in each case.|e
mn015|and then then instantiate them.|2
me010|yeah and that's|aa
mn015|that's maybe the the way the only way it works.|am
me010|yeah that's the only way it could work.|aa
me010|i we have a our local expert on p.r.m.'s.|s
me010|uh but my guess is that they're not currently good enough to do that.|s
me010|but we'll we'll have to see.|s
me010|uh|fh
mn015|but uh|%--
me010|yes.|bk
me010|this is that's that would be a good thing to try.|ba
me010|it's related to the hobbs abduction story.|s
me010|in that you you throw everything into a pot.|s
me010|and you try to come up with the uh|s
mn015|except there's no no theorem prover involved.|arp
fe004|best explanation.|2
me010|no there isn't a theorem prover.|ar
me010|but there but but the um the the the p.r.m.'s are like rules of inference.|s
me010|and you're you're coupling a bunch of them together.|s
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|b
me010|and then instead of proving you're trying to you know compute the most likely.|s
me010|uh|fh
me010|tricky.|ba
me010|but you yeah it's a good it's a it's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal.|cs
mn015|what's it?|%
me010|so are you going to write something for us before you go?|rt
mn015|yes.|aa
mn015|um|fh
me010|oh you have something.|bu
mn015|in the process thereof or whatever.|aap
me010|okay.|bk
me010|so what's what when are we going to meet again?|qw
fe004|when are you leaving?|qw
fe004|thursday?|bu
mn015|uh|s
fe004|friday?|bu
mn015|thursday's my last day here.|s
fe004|okay.|bk
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|so|fh
mn015|i would suggest as soon as possible.|cs
mn015|do you mean by we the whole gang?|rt
me010|no i didn't mean just the two of us.|ar
me010|we obviously we can we can do this.|s
me010|but the question is do you want to for example send the little group uh a draft of your thesis proposal?|qy
me010|and get uh another session on feedback on that.|e
me010|or|fh
mn015|we can do it thursday again.|cs
mn015|yeah.|bk
me045|fine with me.|ba
me045|should we do the one p.m. time?|cs
me045|for thursday since we were on that before!|d
me045|or|qrr
mn015|sure.|aa
me045|okay.|bk
me010|all right.|bk
fn050|huh.|b
mn015|thursday at one?|bu
mn015|i can also maybe then sort of run through the uh the talk i have to give at e.m.l.|cs
mn015|which highlights all of our work.|cs
me010|okay.|bk
mn015|and we can make some last minute changes on that.|s
me010|okay.|bk
me003|you can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper.|cs
me010|that'll tell him exactly what's going on.|na
me010|yeah that|%--
fe004|can we do can we do one thirty?|qy
me010|all right.|fg
mn015|no.|ar
fe004|oh you already told me no.|bk
fe004|one.|s
mn015|but we can do four.|cs
fe004|okay it's fine.|bk
fe004|i can do one.|ba
fe004|it's fine.|ba
fe004|it's fine.|ba
mn015|one or four.|cs
mn015|i don't care.|bd
me045|to me this is equal.|na
me045|i don't care.|bd
mn015|if it's equal for all?|bu
mn015|what should we do?|qw
fe004|yeah it's fine.|aa
fe004|fine.|%
mn015|four?|d
fe004|yeah|aa
fe004|no no no uh i don't care.|ar
fe004|it's fine.|ba
mn015|it's equal to all of us.|df
mn015|so you can decide.|s
mn015|one or four.|e
me003|the pressure's on you nancy.|s
mn015|liz actually said she likes four.|s
mn015|because it forces the meeting recorder people to cut you know the discussions short.|df
fe004|okay.|bk
fe004|okay four.|bk
fe004|okay?|bu
fe004|okay i am.|s
me045|well if you insist then.|ba
