me001|if you're popular.|s
me018|one two three four five six i'm on seven.|z
me011|we're on.|s
mn014|it's probably the p z m's.|z
fe008|yeah.|z
me011|so i think we pre crashed.|s
me011|so i think we're okay.|s^ba
fe008|pre crashed.|s^bk^m
me011|so it should be a really short meeting i hope.|s^t^tc
me011|uh agenda items number one i want to talk since we were just discussing that is microphone issues.|s^t^tc
me011|what the heck are we going to do about microphones?|qh
me011|so uh i got passed on that the e d u group doesn't like the uh crown mikes.|s
fe008|oh.|s^ba
mn017|who does?|qw
me011|i do.|s
fe008|i do.|s
me011|i i think i find them very comfortable.|s^ba
fe008|yeah i do too.|s^aa|s
me011|uh but it seems to depend on your head shape.|s
me018|so you guys need to start going to the e d u meetings.|s^cs^j
mn017|i see.|s^bk
mn017|they don't work for me very well.|s^ba
me011|that's right.|b
me001|yeah right.|s^aa^j
mn017|i much prefer these.|s^ba
me011|yep.|s^bk
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|um|fh
me001|me too.|s^na
mn014|so do i.|s^na
me018|i prefer these.|s
me018|but i don't mind using those.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
me001|those are intimidating.|s^ba
me011|so apparently they they like|s.%--
me011|it has one good effect that people are trying to get there early.|s
me011|because the people who get there early get to pick the mike.|s^df
fe008|interesting.|s^ba
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me011|people who show up late have to use these.|s
me011|so um we should probably get different mikes.|s
me011|so the question is the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more um sony mikes.|s
me011|just two more of those.|s
me011|um and that that's easy.|s
me011|and that will certainly work.|s
me011|the other option is to try yet another mike.|s
me011|find one we like and potentially get six all the same.|s
fe008|i have a question about this.|s
fe008|are the auditory quality is it uh much different between this kind and the the fancy ones?|qr^rt
me011|um these are better if they're worn correctly.|s^na
fe008|they are?|qy^bh^d
me018|those are better than the sonys?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|okay.|s^bk
mn014|have you have you listened to to them?|qy^rt
me011|yeah yeah definitely.|s^aa|s^na
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|yeah?|qy^bu^m^rt
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|okay.|s^bk
me011|so i mean they're not a lot better.|s
me011|but they are a little better.|s
me001|are they more directional?|qr
me001|the microphones as far as|s^e.%-
me011|um they're more directional.|s^na
me011|a little better error uh noise cancellation.|s
me011|and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth like this.|s
me001|okay.|s^bk
me011|whereas that one to avoid breath noise you really have to put it at to the side.|s
me011|so you seem to get better signal with this one.|s
fe008|the other thing is is it just a few people who don't like them in the e d u group?|qy^rt
fe008|because|%-
me011|i don't know.|s^no
me011|but you know in in sort of random polling|s^rt.%-
mn017|liz liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them.|s
mn017|they are|s.%-
fe008|gosh!|s^ba^fe
fe008|because i much prefer them.|s
fe008|i think they're a whole lot multiple levels better.|s^ba^df
fe008|it seems a shame to discard discard them if if they're better auditory quality and there're only a few people who who object.|s^ba
me011|i mean so|s.%-
mn017|right.|s^aa
me018|yeah that's why i was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in.|fg|s^cs
me011|well i mean that's the other option is that we could switch the form so it's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike.|s^cs
mn017|you know pretty|s.%-
me011|um and then get duplicates.|s^cs
mn017|huh.|b
me011|i mean there's no problem with that.|s^ba
me011|it's just what should we get just more sony ones?|qy
me011|i hate the sony ones.|s^ba
me001|which ones are those?|qw
me011|the one you're wearing.|s
me001|the one i'm wearing?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn014|those.|s
me011|because it it pinches pinches the temples too much.|s^df
me001|oh.|s^bk
me001|oh.|s^bk
me011|i mean so if you wear it sort of around the back it's not too bad.|s^ba
fe008|and|%-
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
me001|yeah.|b
fe008|i hate it.|s^ba
me011|but i|%-
fe008|because it's hard to adjust the microphone.|s^df
me011|right.|b
fe008|i mean i spend all this time fumbling around with it.|s
fe008|and still not reasonable.|s^ba
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|right.|b
me011|so i mean we could try another mike.|s^cs
me011|but then we have the wiring issue.|s^df
me011|and so i i don't know what to do what do.|s^no
me011|what do people think?|qo
mn014|but the problem is again the the plug or|qr^bu^d.%--
me011|the plug is proprietary.|s
me011|so that's why i was saying getting more sony ones is trivial.|s^ba
mn014|okay okay.|s^bk
me011|because we can just go out and buy them.|s^df
mn014|okay.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired.|s
fe008|okay now maybe i just don't know this.|fg|s
fe008|but um are the only two possibilities from sony the two that we've tried?|qy^rt
fe008|or is there another|qrr.%-
me011|yes.|s^aa
me011|so the only possibilities from sony are that one and the lapel mike.|s
fe008|i see okay.|s^bk
fe008|okay.|b
fe008|oh i see.|s^bk
me011|so this isn't sony.|s
me011|this is crown.|s
me011|the one we're wearing.|s^e
fe008|isn't that something?|qy^bh
fe008|okay.|b
me011|and so we had these wired for us.|s
fe008|oh i see okay.|s^bk
me018|well it it seems like right now if if what they're complaining are those|s^rt.%--
me011|and so|fh
fe008|huh i remember that now.|s
me018|if we just got two more of these|s^cs.%-
me011|i think that's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately and have them available.|s^na
me018|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me018|and then they can just unplug those from the transmitter.|s^bu
me011|right and just make sure that you write down crown or sony on the mike number.|s^aa|s
me011|which i'll change to mike type or something like that.|s^cc
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|it might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too.|s^cs
fe008|because that would be an easy place for uh an error in the data.|s^df
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe008|for it to be forgotten.|s^e
me011|well it'll be me|s^ng.%--
me011|it'll be whoever's setting up the meeting.|s^ng
me011|who fills out the key file.|s
me011|so|fh
fe008|okay it's just i'm just thinking that if|fg|s^bk.%-
me011|it has the same potential for error as everything else.|s^df
fe008|it'd be|%--
fe008|yeah but i know but i mean to have the user fill it out wouldn't be as reliable as have the|s^bk|s^ba.%-
me011|no no we definitely would not have the user fill it out.|s^ar|s
fe008|good okay.|s^ba
me011|it would be me chuck or liz depending on which meeting it is.|s
fe008|perfect.|s^ba
fe008|perfect okay.|s^ba
me011|okay so we'll definitely go ahead and do that.|fg|s^cc
me018|how much is it just to buy the mike?|qw^rt
me011|couple hundred.|s
me018|really?|qy^bh
me011|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|is that more or less than you thought?|qr
me011|it depends on how good the mike is.|s
me018|oh that's way more than i thought.|s
me018|i|%-
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|oh okay.|s^bk
me001|for one of these?|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me011|well the crown ones were like two fifty.|s
me011|i think those are like one ninety.|s
me001|god!|s^ba^fe
mn014|oops!|s^ba^fe
me018|wow!|s^ba^fe
me011|but|fh
me018|is there any educational discount?|qy^rt
me011|yeah right.|s^aa^j
me011|no.|s^ar
mn014|student discount.|s^bk^j^m
me011|yeah good mikes are expensive.|fg|s^ba
me018|and when i was at computer motion we used shure.|s
me011|so|fh
me018|the s. m. ten a.'s.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me018|and i think they were only like eighty bucks or something.|s
me011|yeah eighty or ninety for the shures.|s^aa|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|so|fh
me018|but they were they seemed pretty good.|s^ba
me011|i mean the sony ones are expensive.|s
me011|because they're proprietary.|s^df
me011|so they can charge whatever they want.|s
me018|oh.|s^bk
me011|these are expensive.|s^ba
me011|because they're quite high quality.|s^df
me018|right right.|b
me011|so|fh
me011|so we should buzz that out if we send the data to sony.|s^cs
mn017|uh come on.|s.%
fe008|we should keep a list of things we're going to bleep out and the conditions under which|s^cs.%-
me011|well i'm just joking.|s^bd
me011|so you do not have to bleep that out.|s
me011|i don't mind if sony knows my opinion.|s^df
me011|so|fh
mn017|huh.|b
me011|um.|fg
me011|also we're i want to double check with morgan.|s^t^tc
me011|he did say yes before i went to japan on buying another wireless system.|s
me011|so that we can go all wireless instead of the mix of wired and wireless.|s
me011|and i think that's the right thing to do.|s^ba
me018|so then all those red channels there would become wireless ones?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|and i'm|%-
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|s^aa
me018|cool.|s^ba
me011|yep.|b
me001|uhhuh.|b
me011|four more wireless.|s
me011|um|fh
me011|and also i'm going to probably replace the andrea mike with a shure.|s
me011|but i'll test it uh sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the shure one really works.|s^cc
me011|because i have an extra shure in my office.|s^df
me018|the andrea mike?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
me011|yeah apparently it's had some problems.|s^aa|s^e
mn014|that's causing problems.|s^2
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|which one is the andrea mike?|qw
fe008|it was over here sometimes.|s
me018|a wired one?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn014|the yeah a wired one.|s^aa|s^na
me011|yeah it's uh|s^aa|s.%-
me018|well if you're going to go to all wireless|s.%--
me018|oh you mean in the meantime.|s^bu
me011|this one.|s
me011|in the meantime right.|s^m^na|s^aa
me018|uh i see.|s^bk
me011|because uh it'll it'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from sony anyway.|s^df
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|i haven't in the meetings that i recorded it's always been at most six people.|s
me011|so|fh
me018|so i've never had to|s.%--
me011|oh really?|qy^bh
me011|yeah.|s^bk
me018|recently i haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all.|s
me011|i guess because everyone's been out of town.|s^am
me011|probably over the summer it'll be the same.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|because it tends to be less fewer people.|s^df
me011|um|fh
me011|file|s.%--
me011|uh done with microphone issues i think?|qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc
fe008|should we close the door?|qy^rt
me011|if you want.|s^na^rt
fe008|oh i'm thinking i don't know about the acoustics.|s^df
fe008|that's that's all i was wondering about.|s^bd
me011|and this way we can get a door slam in the uh in the transcript file.|s^e^j
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|yeah that's right we got to get the obligatory door slam.|s^aa|s
me011|oh well.|s^ba
me011|not quite a slam.|s^ba
me018|there's some knocks.|s
mn017|get a special phone for that.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|uh the door slam phone?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|i guess|%--
fe008|right the door slam phone.|s^bk|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me018|you have a special phone?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|no we could add one.|s^ar|s^cs
me018|oh we could add one yeah.|s^bk^m|s^aa
me011|and then we could have the phone phone.|s^cs
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|for for when the phone rings.|s
fe008|that's an idea.|s^am
me011|um|fh
me011|uh file reorganization.|s^t^tc
me011|this is something we were talking about before i left.|s^rt
me011|and saying we should probably wait until after i'm back.|s^rt
me011|and now i'm back.|s^rt
me011|so we should do that at some point.|s^cs
me011|so we should get ourselves a list of everything we want to do to reorganize the file structure and anything else.|s^cs
mn017|can i can i just mention something?|qy^rt
me011|sure.|s^aa
mn017|um uh i think the file regards reorganization also um another issue there is disk space probably.|h|s^bu
mn017|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me011|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn017|um so|fh
mn017|i know that the files that you've been cutting up for us for the recognition experiments|s^rt.%--
me001|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uh one way one really brain uh brain dead way of of of not causing any trouble but saving disk space is to uh use the the sphere the nist uh w encode program to to encode you know to compress them.|s^cs
me011|shorten?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|is that the same as shorten?|qy^rt
mn017|uh yeah but it does it it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently.|s^aa|s
me001|yeah.|s^aa
me011|well okay you mean it's built into the s r i.|s^bk|s^bu
me011|because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools.|s
me011|so|fh
mn017|uh i guess.|s^am
mn017|but it|%--
mn017|um|fh
me011|so it's just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools.|s
mn017|well it's it's actually built into the sphere library that nist delivers.|s
me018|well like|%-
me011|oh really?|qy^bh
mn017|so|fh
me011|i didn't know that.|s^no
mn017|right.|s^aa
mn017|and actually the sound tools don't understand that for the|s.%-
me018|at least feacalc doesn't.|s^2
mn017|at least feacalc doesn't.|s^m^na
mn017|so|fh
me011|well that's not a sound tool.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
mn017|but since since these files are made to be used with the s r i recognizer|s.%--
mn017|uh and the s r i front end uses the sphere library which in turn does this transparently um uh that will be a quick and quick and easy way to just uh get you know uh be able to use more|s.%-
me001|yeah.|fg
me018|uhhuh.|b
me001|the other thing i could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything to my eighteen gig disk which is local.|s^cs
mn017|but that's going to be only temporary.|s^ng
me001|well i mean i don't know|s^df^no.%-
mn017|i mean you should do that too probably.|s^bd^cs
mn017|but but as you do that you can also just run the|s^cs.%-
me001|yeah it is kind of a temporary solution.|fg|s^na
me001|to shorten everything?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|well actually the what you do is you run|s^cs.%--
mn017|oh now i have another use for the|s^t1.%--
mn017|the way i recently used it|s.%--
mn017|and there might be better ways.|s^bd
mn017|so the program's called w encode.|s^rt
me001|huh.|b
mn017|and i think the type you say um i think dash t.|s^rt
mn017|and then there are different different encoding methods.|s
mn017|but if you want to use the shorten one you say minus t shorten.|s
mn017|and then the old uh wavefile and the new wavefile.|s
mn017|and then|s.%--
mn017|oops!|s^fe
mn017|and then i check you know if this works|s.%--
mn017|so you can use the the shell and operator or something.|s
mn017|then i just move the new wavefile to the you know to the old wavefile.|s
me011|right.|b
mn017|and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to decode it on the fly.|s
me001|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and that that just saved my butt.|s^ba
me001|okay.|b
mn017|because i actually was running on a different experiment.|s^df
mn017|i had segmented i was processing the whole switchboard two corpus.|s
mn017|which is two hundred eighty hours of speech.|s
mn017|and i was noticing as i was almost finishing the processing that i was running out of disk space.|s
mn017|and and so|fh
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|i uh had this flash of inspiration of just|s.%--
mn017|uh the same the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them.|s
me011|shortening everything on the fly.|s^2^rt
mn017|so i while this other thing was still going on i was i was running this this thing.|s
me011|you had another process running that was shortening it.|s^2
fe008|wow wow.|s^ba
me011|yep.|b
mn017|and low and behold i gained three three gig of space.|s
mn017|and um you know|%-
me018|wow.|s^ba
me011|did you have to re nice one of the processes to make sure that shorten?|qy
mn017|no no actually it was fast enough.|s^ar|s^nd
mn017|this is very fast this this really runs quickly.|s^ba
fe008|wow.|s^ba
mn017|and that's|%-
fe008|that must have been suspenseful.|s^ba
mn017|that was very suspenseful.|s^ba^m^na
me011|watching the disk meter.|s
mn017|that was that was the most excitement i had all weekend.|s^ba
mn017|uh uh boy!|s^fe
mn017|it uh came out just fine.|s^ba
me001|to be okay.|s^2
mn017|so|fh
me018|you know what would be a|%--
me018|i don't know if this would mess other things up.|s^bd
me018|but it seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around.|s^ba^rt
me018|what would be easier would be like pointers.|s^cs
me011|the list.|s^2
me011|yep.|b
me018|you know lists like original wavefile start end.|s:s
me011|start end.|s^2
me011|yep the way feacalc calc does it.|s^aa|s
me018|this is|%-
mn017|right the the only reason we do this is because the the s r i front end doesn't have a way to to um go into a a longer file with indices.|fg|s
mn017|um so i i suppose someone could try to put a hack like that into the|s^cs.%-
me001|and segment on the fly.|s^2
me011|it would be easy.|s^ba
me011|it wouldn't be hard at all.|s^ba
me011|someone just needs to sit down and do it who has some time.|s^rt
mn017|so|fh
mn017|but there's also some|s.%--
mn017|i guess|s.%--
me011|and that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around.|s
me011|about the only difficulty with that is if it's compressed then you really do have to decompress it first.|s
mn017|that's true.|s^aa
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|because the pointers are|s^df.%--
me011|you don't know how much it's|s.%-
me011|it doesn't compress it by a fixed amount.|s
mn017|exactly right right right right right.|s
me018|well is there is there is there a nist routine which can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices?|qy^rt
mn017|i don't think so.|s^no
me011|and yeah i mean that it|fh|s.%-
mn017|no no i mean if you|s^ar|s.%--
mn017|the the the|%--
mn017|if you can operate on the full|s^cs.%--
mn017|if you don't have to segment it then there would be less of a reason to do the compression.|s
mn017|because you don't have that wasted that extra copy.|s^df
me018|right right we i mean the original switchboard files are not compressed.|fg|s^bu
mn017|so|fh
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|right.|s^aa
me018|so we could leave those as they are.|s^cs
me011|well i mean it just depends on how much disk space is a problem.|s^aap
mn017|right.|b
me011|i mean the what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place.|s^cs
me011|and then operate on it and then delete it.|s^cs
me011|but|fh
mn017|i mean the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions.|s
mn014|just silences.|s^2
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|and if you have you know twenty channels and only five speakers then it's|s.%-
me011|that's true.|s^aa
me001|uhhuh.|b
me018|well assuming you'd yeah assuming that you then off load the original switchboard files.|s
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|so|fh
me001|huh|b
me011|yeah.|b
me011|well it seems like just shortening them is a good short term solution.|fg|s^ba^cs
me018|yeah yeah.|b
me011|so we don't have to do any coding.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me001|but i think kind of we've had there was a big disk crash when you were gone.|s
me011|so|fh
me001|and|%-
me011|no it was i was still here.|s^ar|s^nd
me011|it was the day i left.|s
me001|oh was that the day you left?|s^bk|qy^bu^m^rt
me001|that's suspicious.|s^ba^j
me018|he did it on purpose.|s^j
me001|yeah.|s^aa^j
me001|leave to japan the day the disk crashes.|s
me011|no if i if i had done it on purpose i would have timed it right after i left.|s^bd|s^df
me001|but um|fg
me001|yeah so chuck helped me out in uh regenerating all the the different channel files for like a few meetings.|fh|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me001|for like six meetings.|s^e
me001|so i think they're split up even further.|s^ba
me001|it's kind of even more disorganized now.|s^ba
me001|since we moved some of the meetings to different directories.|s^df
me001|they're on a different disk even.|s^bu
me001|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me001|i think you didn't you expand them to x e on abbott?|qy^rt
me018|are they?|qy^bu^rt
fe008|x f.|s
me001|no you the ones that you the ones that you put them on when you put them on x e.|s^ar|s
fe008|oh different ones?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|i don't remember where i put them now.|s^no
me001|i think you put them on x e.|s
me018|okay.|s^bk
me001|so|fh
fe008|well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was it with a with a meta disk allocation you had both transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on x e were on the same|s.%--
fe008|sorry.|s^fa
fe008|different partitions of the same physical disk.|s
me018|physical disk.|s^2
me001|huh.|b
fe008|and it's conceivable|s.%--
fe008|i mean i i don't|s^bd.%--
fe008|i mean so um i was told that it's possible that that might have uh caused additional wear on it maybe caused it to to go bad sooner.|s
me001|huh.|b
me011|well i think there was something else going on.|s
me011|because uh dave johnson said that d d was getting accessed frequently.|s^df
fe008|oh uhhuh.|b
me011|and it shouldn't be.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|that data never gets touched.|s
fe008|well why not?|qw
me011|because we write it once and then we never touch it again.|s
fe008|oh sure it does.|s
me011|just the backed up space.|s^df
me018|yeah after each meeting we copy the data to|fg|s.%-
fe008|except that|s.%-
fe008|well i mean so the wavefiles or or anything at all because the transcripts are there as well?|qr^bu^d
me011|the wave files.|s
me011|i mean he was saying gigabytes.|s
fe008|oh gigabytes i see.|s^bk^m|s^bk
me011|and so it has to be the wave files.|s
me018|yeah there was something weird about that.|fg|s
fe008|yeah that's right.|s^bk
me011|yeah so i asked dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet.|fg|s
me011|but we should definitely double check on it.|s^cs
me018|yeah like like the same meeting shortened files that we pull off of popcorn when we're done doing the recording looked to the backup software as if they had been written you know every single night for you know a week in a row.|fg|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|every night.|s^2
fe008|is that right?|qy^bh
fe008|that's very strange.|s^ba
me018|which is really weird.|s^ba
me001|wow!|s^fe
fe008|i didn't realize that.|s^no
fe008|okay.|b
me011|so at any rate so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we're going to do and then when we're going to do it.|s^cs^t^tc
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me011|so i'm not sure who isn't involved with that.|s^no
me011|i mean certainly me chuck and jane.|s
me011|anyone else care?|qo^rt
mn017|no.|s^ar
fe008|and i and i'd like in terms of the conventions to also uh you know send a bit to dan ellis to see if it's if there's any get his input on it.|s^cs
fe008|i don't think i don't think that'll be|s.%--
me011|right.|s^bk
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|so maybe we should do that|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|not during this meeting but another time.|s^cs
me018|yeah.|b
me011|and just get a list of everything we're going to do.|s^cs^e
fe008|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|fg
me018|maybe next week if we could.|s^cs
me011|okay.|s^bk
me018|i'm trying to finish up some stuff.|s^df
fe008|yeah sure i'd like to|s^aa|s.%--
me011|so just update all the naming conventions.|s
me011|and put all the files where they really belong on one disk.|s^cs
me018|that sounds like a good idea.|s^ba
me011|and then leave leave everything in place until the back up until the next full back up.|s^cs
me011|and then delete the old ones.|s^cs^e
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe008|okay now and you're just you're not talking about the the x disks the x uh partitions.|fg|s^bu
me011|so|fh
fe008|just the backed up space.|s
fe008|or|qrr.%--
me011|well both need to be reorganized.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me011|so um|fh
me011|various paths|s.%--
me011|i mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way.|s
me011|because um|s^df.%-
me018|i think we should also at the same time try to uh convert over to your new naming conventions.|s^cs
me011|yes exactly.|s^aa|s^na
me011|that too.|s^na
me018|that'd be good.|s^ba
me011|so that's what i was saying we need to get a list of all that stuff that we want to do.|s
me018|yeah.|b
fe008|okay.|b
me011|and so|fg
me011|i didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that i sent out.|s
me011|so i assume that's all right with everyone.|s
me018|i actually haven't looked at it yet i haven't had a chance.|s
fe008|i haven't either.|s
me011|oh.|s^bk
me001|no.|s^aa
mn014|huh.|b
fe008|sorry.|s^fa
me018|so|fh
fe008|i will by next week though.|s^cc
me011|and|%-
mn017|uh i don't know about the naming.|fg|s
me011|okay then i should have made that as an agenda item.|s^bk|s
mn017|i mean so these names that we've been using so far are with|s.%--
mn017|uh uh uh|fh
mn017|i wouldn't just want to change them you know without some advance notice.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
mn017|i mean that's all these segment names that we've been using|s.%--
me001|yeah.|b
mn017|i would rather not mess with them until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently dealing with.|s
me001|yeah i'm|s^aa|%-
me001|right.|b
me011|well i mean how you choose to do it the naming is up to you.|s
mn017|so|fh
me001|well|%-
mn017|right.|b
me011|so|fh
fe008|you're talking about different files.|s
me001|i mean it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you're doing.|s
me001|but|fh
me011|yep.|b.%
me001|yeah i kind of agree with andreas.|fh|s
me001|like i'm a little bit|s.%-
me018|i mean these|s.%-
me001|i looked at the naming conventions.|s
me001|and they look fine to me.|s^ba
me001|but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be|s^rt.%--
me018|well if we|%-
me018|if we change things it won't really affect what you're doing.|s^bu
me001|no but i think just to be consistent we should also i mean have the same conventions just in case you want|s^ar|s^df.%-
fe008|this|%-
me018|will it?|qy^g^rt
me011|right.|b
me018|yeah so you but you can switch that any time you want.|fg|s^bu
me001|yeah yeah i mean it's only going to affect my work.|s^aa|s
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me001|so|fh
me001|yeah it's not going to|s.%--
me018|i mean if we|%-
me001|i assume you're not going to go like into you know my directories and change my file names.|s
mn017|right.|b
me001|so|fh
me011|i actually i was going to do a global search replace on all entries at at icsi.|s
me018|everybody will use it.|s
me001|yeah.|b
me018|fine slash u slash star.|s^bk|s
me011|to change m r to m r m at all places at icsi.|s
me001|yeah.|b
me001|that'd be great.|s^ba
me001|really enjoy that.|s^ba
fe008|with no with no advance warning.|s^2
me011|you|%--
me011|well maybe i shouldn't say that on record.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me011|there was a typo in some of the contracts that morgan got that someone|s.%--
me011|one of our sponsors did a global search and replace for between sponsor and their name.|s:s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe008|oh no oh no.|s^ba
me011|and so it it was saying uh|s.%--
me011|well anyway.|s^bd^tc
me011|i won't|s.%-
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|i'm not sure whether that's right.|s
fe008|one one can imagine that that might be problematic.|s
me011|yeah one can imagine the problems that that would engender.|s^aa|s
fe008|but this this name change affects a subset.|s^bu
me011|so|fg
fe008|doesn't need to reflect everything.|s^bu
fe008|yeah.|b
me001|right.|s^aa
me011|right.|s^aa
me011|um|fg
me011|thilo you had you wanted to talk about the|s^t^tc.%-
mn014|yeah i had one one short point.|s^aa|s
mn014|i have just installed a transcriber version on one of our n t machines.|s^rt
mn014|so it's available under windows now.|s^rt
mn017|oh great!|s^ba^fe
mn017|actually someone i just got an email this week from someone|s.%-
fe008|isn't that great?|qy^bh
mn014|yeah i responded to i have already responded to him.|s^aa|s
mn014|i i don't know what what what he what the problem was.|s^no
mn017|to anant?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn014|it was really straightforward.|s^ba
mn014|really easy.|s^ba
fe008|and this is not|s.%-
mn017|oh i'm sorry.|s^fa
mn017|i i just|s.%--
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so who did you talk to?|qw^rt
mn014|there was some some guy from s r i who wanted to to install|s.%--
mn017|anant?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn014|yeah.|s^aa^rt
mn017|anant venkataraman?|qy^bu^d^e^rt
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|okay.|s^bk
mn014|and he sent an email that he couldn't couldn't install it.|s
mn017|yeah okay great.|b
mn014|and i i just described him well what i did.|s
mn017|yeah okay.|b
mn017|great great thanks thanks.|s^ba|s^ft
mn014|and it was really straightforward.|s^ba
mn014|so|fh
fe008|and this is not just the transcriber.|s^bu
fe008|this is the channeltrans.|s^bu
fe008|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn014|yeah it's the channeltrans.|s^aa|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn014|so the the things that dave gelbart|s.%-
fe008|yeah excellent.|s^bk
mn017|cool.|s^ba
fe008|excellent.|s^ba
me011|so you should probably talk to a sys admin and get it put in some central place.|s^cs
me011|so that it'll work on all the n t machines.|s^df
fe008|well i mean as it stands i i guess.|s
mn014|okay.|s^bk
fe008|yeah i see what you mean.|s
fe008|it'll it'll be on the on the unix side.|s^bu
mn014|i've|%-
fe008|but accessible through the h drive.|s^bu
me011|right.|s^aa
fe008|yeah.|s^bk
mn014|okay yeah i could do that.|s^bk|s
me011|so i assume tcl t k wasn't already on the machine so you had to install it.|s^bu
me011|yeah.|s^bk
mn014|i had to install it yeah.|s^na|s^aa
fe008|huh yeah.|b
mn017|uh|b
me018|so andreas would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going?|qy^rt^tc
me018|uh|fh
mn017|oh well yeah i i i actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it.|s^aa|s^no
mn017|because it has uh very little to do with with meeting recordings.|s^df
me011|huh.|b
mn017|but you know i did uh run um some recognition experiments with icsi front end.|s
mn017|um uh|fh
mn017|and and you know this is the joint work with chuck.|s
mn017|and uh um|fh
mn017|so first uh you know we had we figured out sometime last week how to um|s.%--
mn017|and and chuck wrote this really nice little script perl script that takes a uh waveform runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the into um a so-called uh cepstra file.|s
mn017|which is what the s r i system uses to read features.|s
mn017|it's essentially uh uh nist headered uh waveform.|s
mn017|you know it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have feature vectors following the header.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and um that's all done um by the script.|s^rt
mn017|and it works great.|s
mn017|and uh i first trained up two systems.|s
mn017|because it's you know the s r i system is gender dependent.|s^df
mn017|so to be comparable i trained uh um on a on a so-called short training set.|s
mn017|um a male system and a female system|fh|s.%--
mn017|and uh|fh
mn017|also for debugging purposes and for the heck of it i trained um trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the s r i front end from scratch.|s
mn017|um and compared the two.|s^rt
me011|so what features did you use?|qw^rt
mn017|well we used uh twelve p l p uh uh|s.%-
me011|so not rasta.|s^bu
me011|just p l p.|s^bu
me018|just p l p.|s^2
mn017|just p l p.|s^aa^m
mn017|and actually that uh one of the questions i had was what the rasta would possibly buy us.|s
mn017|but um we'll talk about that later.|s
mn017|so the uh so the baseline system the s r i system was uh used uh also uh uh used twelve uh mel uh mel cepstra um based on a twenty four filter bank um analysis.|s^rt
mn017|um|fh
mn017|i do not know what|s^no.%--
mn017|so the the bandwidth of the um s r i front end is from hundreds hertz to thirty|s.%-
me018|thirty seven fifty.|s^2
mn017|thirty seven fifty or something like that.|s^aa^m
mn017|and i do not know what the um icsi um front end would do.|s
mn017|i mean what the bandwidth is.|s
mn017|um|fh
mn017|but the results are such that|s.%--
mn017|uh let's see.|s^t1
me018|there's one other slight difference.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|or two two differences.|s^bsc
mn017|oh yeah.|s^aa
mn017|so the s r i system also does um vocal tract length normalization.|s
mn017|and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the icsi features.|s
mn017|so that's one difference.|s
mn017|and the other difference is that in the uh in the s r i system the uh the first the c zero the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest.|s
mn017|and what they do is they they subtract the maximum|s.%--
me011|huh.|b
mn017|for each waveform segment they subtract the maximum of of over that waveform segment from from the values of for that waveform.|s
mn017|which is a kind of automatic gain control that is localized|s.%-
me018|do they subtract the max from each one or do they subtract each one from the max?|qr
me011|who cares?|qo
mn017|they subtract|s.%-
me018|doesn't matter?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|no just would be a sign change.|s^ar|s
me018|except you get a lot of negatives the other way.|s
mn017|right right right.|s^aa
mn017|um and then after but after they done this waveform based normalization they then do a conversation length normalization just like all the other features.|s
mn017|so it's their kind of two stage normalization.|s
me018|oh oh!|s^bk^fe
mn017|um now i understand that the common practice here has been to just do standard uh mean subtraction um on the waveform.|s
mn017|um|fh
me018|for the c zero.|s^2^bu
mn017|right but in what we've done so far because we didn't have any special provision for c zero we just treat it as as any of the other features|s^aa|s.%--
mn017|we've done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side.|s
mn017|so um since both s r i and icsi use this sort of local normalization for c zero that's presumably you know someone has done some experiments to and found out that that works better.|s
mn017|um so that's another difference.|s
mn017|and that might account for some of the discrepancies in the results.|s
mn017|um but you know so the the results are|s.%--
mn017|um|fh
mn017|where should i start?|qw^t1
mn017|uh the|fh
mn017|so there's a two|s.%--
mn017|oh i tried it with and without|s.%--
mn017|uh|fh
mn017|so without and with adaptation.|s
me011|how many iterations?|qw
mn017|for the adaptation?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn017|well we always do three e m iterations to|s.%-
me011|okay.|s^bk
mn017|and it's it's this it's this quick and dirty|s.%--
mn017|the phone loop adaptation which doesn't actually require prior recognition paths|s.%--
mn017|and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation.|s^ba
mn017|but it gives you sort of a first idea of what you could gain with it.|s
mn017|and then you know so we have the the s r i front end.|s
mn017|and the icsi front end.|s
mn017|and other than that the system configuration was identical.|s
mn017|so it was the same|s.%--
mn017|they came up with um you know same number of uh gaussians per state cluster.|s
mn017|um same the clustering used the same information loss threshold.|s
mn017|which actually led to roughly the same number of gaussians overall.|s
mn017|so that the system configuration is is comparable.|s
mn017|um and the uh|fh
mn017|so without adaptation|s.%--
mn017|you had forty nine|%-
mn014|that's error rate or recognition rate?|qr^bu^d
mn017|this is error rate.|s
mn017|in percent.|s^e
mn017|and with adaptation it's forty seven point one.|s^rt
mn017|and this this was fifty two point six.|s
mn017|and fifty one point three.|s^rt
me011|huh!|s^ba^fe
mn017|and then when i combined them|s.%--
mn017|i can actually combine them with something like rover.|s
mn017|it's actually more sophisticated than rover.|s
mn017|but it's|s.%--
mn017|um here i got forty eight point five.|s
mn017|and here i got forty six point five.|s
me011|so this is just combination at the utterance level.|s^bu
mn017|um|fh
mn017|at the utterance level right.|s^m^na|s^aa
me011|why do you think the icsi front end is so much worse?|qw
mn017|good question.|s^ba
mn017|that's fine.|s^ba
me011|that seems really odd to me.|s^ba
mn017|um so one percent i would attribute to the lack of v t l.|s
mn017|about one percent.|s^e
me011|oh right right right right.|s^bk
mn017|okay.|b
mn014|okay uh okay.|s^bk
mn017|and then maybe another up|s.%--
mn017|i don't know how much the c zero normalization business really matters.|s^no
mn017|i can't it see i mean can't see it the|s.%-
me011|can you run the s r i just as an experiment run the s r i front end without vocal tract normalization and see how much difference it makes?|qy^rt
mn017|i could yeah.|s^na|s^aa
mn017|i could certainly do that yeah.|s^na^r|s^aa
mn017|um|fh
mn017|we could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the icsi features.|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|that's something we wanted to do.|s
me011|if we could figure out how.|s^2^am
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|we could i was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the m f c c's and just try them with the icsi uh front end.|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um to the p l p|s.%-
me018|yeah dan added that in.|fg|s
me011|yeah but the|fg|%-
me018|but|%-
mn017|uh dan added the|s.%--
mn017|so|fh
me011|they won't|%-
me011|they don't correspond one to one though.|s
mn017|no but they should be close since this|s^aa|s.%--
mn017|i mean the|s.%--
mn017|anyway but i can certainly try the s r i front end without uh v t l.|s
mn017|that that's that's certainly quick to do.|s
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|um and so|fh
mn017|yeah and and then there's all these|fg|s.%--
mn017|um|fh
mn017|you know the number of um|s.%--
mn017|you know this front end had a fair amount of experimentation going into it.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|you know how many filter banks do you use?|qh
mn017|what what bandwidth do you use and stuff like that?|qh
mn017|and uh we could play the same kind of games with the icsi front end.|s^cs
me011|right.|b
mn017|uh actually the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role.|s^ba
mn017|we used to use a narrow bandwidth.|s
mn017|and uh|fh
mn017|uh that hurt us.|s^ba
mn017|so this is um and this is we've now used roughly what everybody else is using.|s
mn017|so|fh
me011|huh!|s^ba^fe
mn017|um there's some room for improvements i figure in this in the icsi front end.|s^cs
mn017|um so|fh
mn017|but the good news is that even with this with the icsi system being that much worse you still get a win out of combining the two.|s
mn017|so that gives some hope for the future.|s
mn017|um|fh
mn017|unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation.|s
mn017|so .um.|fh
mn017|also interestingly the um the difference actually widens.|s^ba
mn017|i would actually expect it or or hope that the adaptation reduces the difference.|s^rt
mn017|because it might um for instance um remove some of the|s^df.%--
mn017|um|fh
mn017|you know if you if you have some some difference in the front end processing that uh is suboptimal but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the um moving the models around|s.%--
mn017|but but apparently that doesn't doesn't really|s.%--
mn017|actually the difference becomes larger.|s^ba
mn017|so|fh
mn017|um anyway so right now what i'm doing is um|s.%--
mn017|uh well there's several things going on.|s
mn017|one is that chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem the system on the tandem features.|s
mn017|so that would actually be the more interesting experiment.|s^ba
mn017|um the other thing is i'm training uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models.|s
me011|right.|b
mn017|and then we can|s^cs.%--
mn017|and i actually want to do the system combination um with our eval system um on some subset of the data at least.|s
mn017|probably only for the males.|s
mn017|because i don't have time to train both males and females.|s^df
mn017|but um uh and um|fh
me018|what about concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one?|qw^cs
me011|it gets pretty big.|s^ba^ng
mn017|it does get pretty big yeah.|s^m^na|s^aa
me018|huh.|s^bk
me011|and my experience with that in broadcast news was usually combining at other levels works better.|s^ba
me018|huh.|s^bk
me011|so|fh
me011|for for whatever that's worth.|s^bd
mn017|oh you tried that on broadcast news?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|oh yeah.|s^aa
mn017|concatenating.|s^rt
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|so|%-
mn017|different feature sets.|s^e
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|did you try uh|qy.%-
me011|it was mostly m s g p l p rasta.|s^rt
mn017|i see.|s^bk
me011|so you know the feature sets we had available.|s^e
mn017|i see.|b
me011|and it was almost always better to combine at the probability level.|s^ba
me011|you know so we'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities.|s
mn017|okay.|b
mn017|all right.|b
mn017|oh.|b
mn017|yeah and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors.|fg|s
me011|yep.|b
mn017|and that would blow up the|%--
me011|you'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards so that they're uh orthogonal.|s
mn017|uh|fh
mn017|right.|s^bk
me011|so you'd want to do a linear transform also.|s
mn017|right.|s^aa
mn017|um so the|fh
mn017|yeah and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the icsi front end to perform better.|s^cs
mn017|um and and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can i can certainly run a s r i system without v t l.|s
me011|yep.|b
mn017|just uh to get|s^e.%-
fe008|without what without v t l.|s^bu^m
mn014|just|%-
me011|vocal tract thing.|s
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|okay.|b
me011|yeah.|b
mn017|and that that's quick to do.|s
mn017|so|fh
me011|i was thinking about tandem system.|s
me011|well let's not talk about it here.|s^bd
me011|but i had some thoughts about the tandem system.|s
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|so but things are moving ahead.|s^t
mn017|so|fh
me011|okay should we do digits?|fg|qy^rt^t^tc
mn017|digits sure.|s^bk^m|s^aa^rt
me011|do we have any other topics?|qy^rt
me011|okay let's do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time.|s^cs
mn017|poetic reading of digits.|s^cs^j
mn014|oh no.|s^bk
me011|why don't we let don go first before his battery dies?|z
me001|huh okay.|z
fe008|do you want to say that one again?|z
fe008|that last one?|z
mn014|um why?|z
fe008|or did did you correct the whole one?|z
mn014|i yeah sure.|z
mn014|yeah no i i got to write so i think.|z
fe008|oh he did?|z
fe008|never mind.|z
mn014|yeah.|z
fe008|okay good.|z
fe008|all right.|z
fe008|so|z
me011|you can really tell from the prosody where it goes.|s^ba
mn017|meeting.|s
mn017|i actually have one more thing that|s.%--
mn017|i don't know if it's if if it's allowed to to bring up after the|s^no.%-
me011|after digits?|qy^d^rt
me011|i don't know.|s^no
mn017|anyway.|fg
mn017|but it might be important for um|s^df.%-
me011|go ahead.|s^co
mn017|so liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where it was later found that several of the microphones were turned off.|s^rt
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|um|fh
mn017|and this must become a problem especially with non speech meetings.|s
mn017|so um|fh
mn017|is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from some of the channels?|qy^rt
mn017|or|qrr.%--
me011|probably we could probably build that in to the front end.|s^am|s^rt
mn017|because it you know it's really annoying if you go through all that trouble.|s^df
mn017|and then basically the meetings aren't useable.|s^df
mn017|because uh even|s^df.%-
me018|what are people doing?|qw
me018|they're switching their mikes off or something?|qr^bu^rt
mn017|i don't know what they do.|s^no
mn017|maybe the batteries went dead.|s^am^cs
mn017|or they just didn't they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the on position or whatever.|s^am^cs^e
me011|i don't know.|s^no
me011|uh uh fff!|s^fe
me011|what would you like it to do when that happens?|qw
mn017|well no if if you um|s^bd|s.%--
mn017|i mean obviously you always|s.%--
mn017|i mean there's never going to be a signal from all the channels.|s
mn017|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|because|s^df.%--
mn017|or rarely.|s^bsc
mn017|um but uh|fh
me011|well if an unblacked out channel is zero is actually spitting out zeros you can be pretty sure it's off.|s
mn017|right.|s^bk
me011|because it doesn't spit out zeros.|s^df
me011|it spits out epsilons.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|because there's little background noise.|s^df
me011|the question is when the software detects it what do you want it to do?|qw
mn017|exactly.|s^aa
mn017|that's a good question.|s^ba
mn017|i don't know.|s^no
mn017|but is there some we can collectively think of some of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of of just|s^cs.%-
me011|i mean it it it|s.%-
me011|we we already have visual feedback.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|you can see whether your mike is working or not.|s^e
mn017|right.|s^aa
mn017|right.|fg
me011|um.|fh
mn017|so maybe it's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal.|s^cs^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
me018|test|%-
me011|turn off the screen saver during the meeting.|s^cs^rt
me018|tell them to test their mikes or|s^cs.%--
mn017|yeah something.|s^am
fe008|i think they|s.%-
me011|yeah i i don't know what to do other than|s.%-
me001|it it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording.|s^cs
me011|there's no sound out right now.|s^ng
me001|oh.|s^bk
me001|never mind.|s^bd
fe008|it should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting.|s^cs^j
me011|yep yep yeah yeah that would be good.|s^aa|s^ba
mn017|oh yeah that's a good one.|s^bk|s^ba
me001|wow!|s^fe
me001|that's not a bad idea.|s^ba
me011|well we can think about what to do about it.|s^cs^t^tc
mn017|yeah okay.|s^bk
me011|but it it's pretty clear we can detect it|%-
me011|so|fh
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me011|okay are we done?|fg|qy^rt^t^tc
mn017|all right.|s^bk
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
