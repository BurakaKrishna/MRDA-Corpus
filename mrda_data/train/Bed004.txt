me003|hey you're not supposed to be drinking in here dude.|z
mn015|okay.|z
me003|do we have to read them that slowly?|z
me003|okay.|z
me003|sounded like a robot.|z
me003|um this is|z
me012|okay.|z
me003|when you read the numbers it kind of reminded me of beat poetry.|z
mn015|i tried to go for the e e cummings sort of feeling.|z
mn015|but|z
me003|three three six zero zero.|z
me003|four two zero zero.|z
me003|one seven.|z
me003|that's what i think of when i think of beat poetry.|z
me012|beat poetry.|z
me003|you ever seen so i married an axe murderer?|z
me012|uh parts of it.|z
mn015|uhhuh.|z
me003|there's a part there's parts when he's doing beat poetry.|z
me012|oh yeah?|z
me003|and he talks like that.|z
me003|that's why i|z
me003|that uh probably is why i think of it that way.|z
mn015|huh.|z
mn015|no i didn't see that movie.|z
mn015|who did who made that?|z
me003|mike meyers is the guy.|z
mn015|oh.|z
mn015|okay.|z
me003|it's his uh it's his cute romantic comedy.|z
me003|that's that's|z
me003|that's his cute romantic comedy yeah.|z
me003|the other thing that's real funny i'll spoil it for you.|z
me003|is when he's he works in a coffee shop.|z
me003|in san francisco.|z
me003|and uh he's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso.|z
me003|and he's like excuse me i ordered the large espresso.|z
mn015|uh we're having a|z
mn015|tiramisu tasting contest this weekend.|z
me003|wait.|z
me003|do are|z
me003|so you're trying to decide who's the best taster of tiramisu?|z
mn015|no.|z
mn015|um there was a a a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best.|z
mn015|and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them.|z
me003|uh|z
mn015|and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste do a blind taste and then vote.|z
me003|huh.|z
mn015|should be fun.|z
me003|seems like|z
me003|seems like you could put a magic special ingredient in so that everyone know which one was yours.|z
me003|then if you were to bribe them you could uh|z
mn015|uhhuh.|z
mn015|well i was thinking if um|z
mn015|you guys have plans for sunday?|z
mn015|we're we're not|z
mn015|it's probably going to be this sunday but um we're sort of working with the weather here.|z
mn015|because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what whoever brings whatever you know can throw it on there.|z
mn015|so only the tiramisu is free nothing else.|z
me003|well i'm going back to visit my parents this weekend.|z
me003|so i'll be out of town.|z
mn015|so you're going to the west bay then?|z
mn015|no.|z
mn015|south bay?|z
me003|no the south bay.|z
me003|yeah.|z
mn015|south bay.|z
me012|well i should be free.|z
me012|so|z
mn015|okay i'll let you know.|z
me012|okay.|z
me003|we are.|z
me003|is nancy uh going to show up?|z
me003|huh.|z
me003|wonder if these things ever emit a very like piercing screech right in your ear.|z
mn015|they are going to get more comfortable headsets.|z
mn015|they already ordered them.|z
mn015|okay.|fh
me012|uh|b
mn015|let's get started.|s^co^t
mn015|the uh|%--
mn015|should i go first with the uh um data?|qy
mn015|can i have the remote control?|qy
mn015|thank you.|s^ft
mn015|okay.|b
mn015|so on friday we had our wizard test data test and um these are some of the results.|fh|s
mn015|this was the introduction.|s^rt
mn015|i actually uh even though liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject i sort of felt that she knew too much.|s^rt
mn015|so i asked uh litonya just on the spur of the moment and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject.|s^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|so this is what she saw as part of as uh for introduction.|s^rt
mn015|this is what she had to read aloud.|s
mn015|uh that was really difficult for her.|s
mn015|and uh|%-
me012|because of all the names you mean?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|the names and um|s^na^rt.%--
mn015|this was the uh first three tasks she had to to master after she called the system.|s^rt
mn015|and um then of course the system broke down.|fh|s
mn015|and those were the uh uh|s.%--
mn015|i should say the system was supposed to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve with a human.|s^rt
mn015|um|fh
mn015|there are here are uh the results.|s
mn015|huh.|fh
mn015|and i will not|s.%--
mn015|we will skip the reading now.|s^t
mn015|um|fh
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|the reading was five minutes exactly.|s^rt
mn015|and now comes the|s.%--
mn015|this is the phone in phase of|s.%--
me012|wait can i i have a question.|fg|s
me012|so so there's no system.|fh|s
me012|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me012|like there was a wizard for both uh both parts.|fh|s
me012|is this right?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|it was it both times the same person.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn015|one time pretending to be a system.|s
mn015|one time to pretending to be a human which is actually not pretending.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|and she didn't|s.%--
mn015|i should|%--
me012|i mean|s.%--
me012|well isn't this kind of obvious when it says okay now you're talking to a human and then the human has the same voice?|fh|qy^rt
mn015|no no no.|s^ar
mn015|we wait.|s^co
mn015|okay good question but uh|s^ba.%--
mn015|you you just wait and see.|s^co
mn015|it's you're going to learn.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and um the wizard sometimes will not be audible.|fh|s^rt
mn015|because she was actually they there was some uh lapse in the um wireless.|s^df
mn015|we have to move her closer.|s
me003|is she mispronouncing anlage?|qy^rt
me003|is it anlaga or anlunga?|qy
mn015|they're mispronouncing everything.|s
mn015|but it's|%--
me003|okay.|s^bk
mn015|this is the system breaking down actually.|s
mn015|did i call europe?|qy^rt
mn015|so this is it.|fh|s
mn015|well if we we um|s.%--
me010|so are are you trying to record this meeting?|qy^rt
mn015|there was a strange reflex.|s^rt
mn015|i have a headache.|s
mn015|i'm really sort of out of it.|s
mn015|okay the uh lessons learned.|s^t^tc
mn015|the reading needs to be shorter.|s^cs
mn015|five minutes is just too long.|s
mn015|um that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here they're going to not they're subjects are probably not going to going to follow the order.|fh|s
mn015|and uh she did not.|s
mn015|she|%-
me012|really?|qh
mn015|no.|s^ar
mn015|she she jumped around quite a bit.|s^rt
me012|oh it's surprising.|s
me010|so if you just number them one two three it's|s^bu.%--
mn015|yeah and make it sort of clear in the uh|s^aa|s.%--
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|right.|s^bk
mn015|um we need to so that's one thing.|fh|s^rt
mn015|and we need a better introduction for the wizard.|fh|s^cs^rt
mn015|that is something that fey actually thought of a in the last second that the system should introduce itself when it's called.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me010|true.|s^aa
mn015|and um um another suggestion by liz was that we uh through subjects switch the tasks.|fg|s^cs
mn015|so when when they have task one with the computer the next person should have task one with a human and so forth.|s^e^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|so we get nice um data for that.|s^rt
mn015|um we have to refine the tasks more and more which of course we haven't done at all so far in order to avoid this rephrasing.|fh|s^cs
mn015|so where even though we don't tell the person ask blah blah blah blah blah.|s
mn015|they still try or at least litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible.|s
me012|say exactly what's on there?|qy^2^rt
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|and uh my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard because i think she did a wonderful job.|s^cs^rt
me010|great.|b
mn015|in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for.|s^rt
mn015|how much is a a bus ticket and a transfer?|qw
mn015|so this is going to happen all the time we you can never be sure.|fh|s^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|um johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard.|fh|s^rt
mn015|so um|fh
me003|yes.|s^aa
me003|i wasn't wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for uh not a man.|s
mn015|but uh|fg
me012|there's no female equivalent of|s.%--
me003|are you sure?|qy^bu^rt
me012|no i don't know.|s^no
me012|not that i know of.|s^no
me010|right.|b
mn015|well there is witch and warlock.|s
mn015|and uh|fh
me012|yeah that's what i was thinking but|s^aa|s.%--
me003|yeah that's so|s.%-
me010|right.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|okay.|fg
me010|uh|fg
mn015|and um|fg
mn015|so some some work needs to be done but i think we can uh|fh|s.%--
mn015|and this and in case no you hadn't seen it this is what litonya looked at during the uh um while taking the while partaking in the data collection.|s
me012|uh.|b
me010|okay.|fg
me010|great.|fg
me010|so first of all i agree that um we should hire fey and start paying her.|fh|s^t
me010|probably pay for the time she's put in as well.|s
me010|um do you know exactly how to do that?|fh|qy
me010|or is uh lila|qrr.%--
me010|i mean you know what exactly do we do to to put her on the payroll in some way?|qw
mn015|i'm completely clueless but i'm willing to learn.|s^ng
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|well you'll have to|s^co.%--
me010|right.|fh
me010|so anyway|fh
me010|um|fh
me010|so why don't you uh ask lila?|qh^co
me010|and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in|s.%-
mn015|student type worker.|s^2
mn015|or|fh
me010|well yeah she's she's not a a student.|s^ng
me010|she just graduated.|s
me010|but anyway|fh
mn015|huh.|b
me010|so if|%--
me010|yeah i agree.|s^tc
me010|she sounded fine.|s
me010|she actually was uh more uh present and stuff than than she was in conversation.|s
me010|so she did a better job than i would have guessed from just talking to her.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|so i think that's great.|s^ba
mn015|this is sort of what i gave her so this is for example how to get to the student prison.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|and i didn't even spell it out here.|s
mn015|and in some cases i i spelled it out a little bit um more thoroughly.|s^rt
me010|right.|b
mn015|this is the information on on the low sunken castle and the amphitheater that never came up.|s
mn015|and um so if we give her even more um instruments to work with i think the results are going to be even better.|fh|s^cs
me010|oh yeah.|s^aa
me010|and then of course as she does it she'll she'll learn.|s
me010|so that's great.|s^ba
me010|um and also if she's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful.|fh|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|and uh she's actually she's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm.|fh|s
me010|so i think this is all just fine in terms of her learning things she's going to need to know uh to do her career.|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|so i my guess is she'll be quite happy to take on that job.|s
me010|and so|fh
mn015|yep.|b
mn015|yeah she she didn't explicitly state that.|s
mn015|so|fh
me010|great.|s^ba
mn015|and um i told her that we going to um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and look for the potential sources to find people.|fh|s
mn015|she also agrees that you know if it's all just going to be students the data is going to be less valuable because of that.|s
mn015|so|fh
me010|well as i say there is this set of people next door it's not hard to|s.%-
mn015|we're already|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|uh|fg
mn015|however we may run into a problem with a reading task there.|s^ng
mn015|and um we'll see.|fh|s
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|we could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there's a task pays ten bucks or something.|s^cs^rt
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff.|fh|s^e
me010|and and there'll probably be self selection to some extent.|fh|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|yep.|b
me010|uh so that's good.|fh|s^ba^tc
me010|um now i signed us up for the wednesday slot and part of what we should do is this.|fh|s^cs^t
mn015|okay.|b^rt
me010|so|fh
me010|my idea on that was uh partly we'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists.|s
me010|but partly i did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all um you know what the dialogue is and what's going on linguistically.|s
me010|because to the extent that we can get them contributing.|s
me010|that will be good.|s^ba
mn015|yep.|b
me010|so this issue about you know re formulating things.|s
me010|maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they'll help us with it.|s^cs
me010|uh other linguists if you're a linguist.|fh|s^bc
me010|but in any case.|s
mn015|yep.|b
me010|um the linguistics students and stuff.|fh|s
me010|so my idea on on wednesday is partly to uh|s^t.%--
me010|you i mean what you did today would is just fine.|s
me010|you just uh do this is what we did and here's the thing and here's some of the dialogue and and so forth.|s
me010|but then the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of of what's going on with the system design.|s^co
me010|and where we think the belief nets fit in.|fh|s
me010|and where the pieces are and stuff like that.|s
mn015|yep.|b
me010|is is this make sense to everybody?|qy^rt
me010|yeah.|fh.%
me010|so i don't i don't think it's worth a lot of work particularly on your part to to to make a big presentation.|s^rt
me010|i don't think you should|s.%--
me010|you don't have to make any new uh powerpoint or anything.|s
me010|i think we got plenty of stuff to talk about.|s
me010|and then um just see how a discussion goes.|fh|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|sounds good.|s^ba
mn015|the uh other two things is um|s^t.%--
mn015|we've can have johno tell us a little about this.|s^cs^rt^t
me010|great.|s^ba
mn015|and we also have a little bit on the interface.|s^rt^t
mn015|m three l enhancement.|s^e^rt^t
mn015|and then um that was it i think.|fh|s
me003|so what i did for this this is uh a pedagogical belief net.|s
me003|because i was i i took i tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out.|s^df
me003|so what i did was i took|s.%--
me003|i made these dummy nodes called trajector-in and trajector-out that would isolate the things related to the trajector.|s
me010|yep.|b
me003|and then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal.|s
me010|yep.|b
me003|and i separated them out.|s
me003|and then i um did similar things for our our net to uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot.|s
me003|um so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer.|fh|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and then the bottom layer is just the mode.|s
me003|so|fh
me010|so let's let's|s^co.%--
me010|yeah i don't understand it.|s^no
me010|let's go|s^co.%--
me010|slide all the way up so we see what the the very bottom looks like.|s^co
me010|or is that it?|qy^rt
me003|yeah there's just one more node and it says mode which is the decision between the|s^aa|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|okay great.|s^bk
me010|all right.|s^bk
me010|so|fh
me003|so basically all i did was i took the last belief net.|s^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and i grouped things according to what how i thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related.|s
me003|and the two that i came up with were trajector-landmark and then source path goal as initial ones.|s
me010|yep.|b
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and then i said well uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|yep.|s^aa
me003|um you know we have we have the concept of what their intention was whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever.|h|s
me010|right.|b
me003|or they were hurried.|s
me003|that's kind of related to that.|s
me003|and then um in terms of the source the things uh the only things that we had on there i believe were whether|fh|s.%--
me003|oh actually i kind of i might have added these because i don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one.|s^bc
me003|but uh whether the where i'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether|fh|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|or the landmark-iness of where i'm currently at.|s^bc
me003|and usefulness is basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that's not something that you'd visit for tourist's tourism's sake or whatever.|s
me003|travel constraints would be something like you know maybe they said they can they only want to take a bus or something like that.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me003|and then those are somewhat related to the path.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|so that would determine whether we'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly.|s^e
me003|um goal.|fh|s
me003|similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed.|s
me003|and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination.|s
me003|um and then if you go up|fh|s.%--
me003|robert.|s
me003|yeah so um in terms of context what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person.|fh|s
me003|um discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours.|fh|s
me003|or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee or something along those lines.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|uh prosody i don't really i'm not really sure what prosody means in this context.|fh|s^rt
me003|so i just made up you know whether whether what they say is or how they say it is is that.|s
me010|right okay.|s^bk
me003|um the parse would be what verb they chose.|fh|s
me003|and then maybe how they modified it in the sense of whether they said i need to get there quickly or whatever.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and um in terms of world knowledge this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things the time of day it is and whatnot.|fh|s
mn015|what's tourbook?|qw
me003|tourbook|s^m.%--
me003|that would be i don't know the landmark-iness of things.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|whether it's in the tourbook or not.|s^e
me010|ch-ch-ch-ch|h
me010|now.|s^tc
me010|all right so i understand what's what you got.|s
me010|i don't yet understand how you would use it.|s^no
me010|so let me see if i can ask.|s
me010|a|%-
me003|well this is not a working bayes-net.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|no i understand that.|s^arp
me010|but but um|fh
me010|so what|qw.%--
me010|let's slide back up again.|s^co
me010|and see|%--
me010|start at the at the bottom.|s
me010|and|%--
me010|oop-bo-doop-boop-boop.|b
me010|yeah.|b
me010|so you could imagine|fg|s^cs.%--
me010|uh go ahead you were about to go up there and point to something.|fh|s^co
me003|well i okay i just|s^nd.%--
me003|say what you were going to say.|s^co
me010|good do it.|s^co
me010|no no.|s^co
me003|okay.|s^aa
me010|go do it.|s^co^r
me003|uh i i'd no i was going to wait until|s^nd.%-
me010|oh okay.|s^bk
me010|so so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh bayes-net.|fg|s
me010|that is you know with fill|s^e.%--
me010|you know actually uh fill it in then uh|s.%--
me003|so we'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the mode.|s^bu
me010|well i don't|s^ng.%--
me010|that's an issue.|s
me010|so um|fh
me003|because i don't understand how it would work otherwise.|s^df
me010|well here's the problem.|s
me010|and and uh bhaskara and i was talking about this a little earlier today.|s
me010|is if we just do this we could wind up with a huge uh combinatoric input to the mode thing.|s^cs
me010|and uh|fh
me003|well i oh yeah i i understand that.|s^na
me003|i just uh it's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that.|s
me010|well but that's what we have to do.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay so so|fg
me010|uh|fh
me010|there there are a variety of ways of doing it.|s
me010|uh let me just mention something that i don't want to pursue today.|fh|s^co^t
me010|which is there are technical ways of doing it.|s^e
me010|uh i slipped a paper to bhaskara and about noisy-or's and noisy-maxes.|s
me010|and|fh
me010|there're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your bayes-net-edness.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|uh so if you you could and|fh|s.%--
me010|now i don't know that any of those actually apply in this case.|s^no
me010|but there is some technology you could try to apply.|s
me003|so it's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that|s^bu.%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|b
me010|and um|fh
me010|so|fh
me003|so in that case the we'd have we|s^bu.%--
me003|i mean these wouldn't be the summary nodes.|s
me003|we'd have the summary nodes like|s.%--
me003|where the things were i guess maybe if if things were related to business or some other|s.%-
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|so what i was going to say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally|s^cs.%--
me003|yeah.|b
me010|i mean not necessarily in in this meeting but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are.|s^cs^e
me010|so if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode.|fh|s
me010|you know what are the most relevant things.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|and the other trick which is not a technical trick it's kind of a knowledge engineering trick is to make the each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics.|s
me010|so that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a tradeoff between three factors whatever they may be.|fh|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me010|then you could say aha let's have these three factors.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me010|and maybe a binary version for each or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one.|s^cs
me003|huh.|b
me010|and then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about.|s
me010|so that so that you know you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing.|s^cs
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|given that we're not going to screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox bayes nets then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|and|fh
me003|so what i kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|uh uh uh|%
me010|yeah.|b
me003|so that|%-
me010|well huh something.|h|s^aap
me010|i mean so uh robert has thought about this problem for a long time because he's had these examples kicking around.|fh|s
me010|so he may have some good intuition about you know what are the crucial things.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|and um i understand where this the uh|fh|s.%--
me010|this is a way of playing with this source path goal trajector uh uh abstraction and and sort of displaying it in a particular way.|s
me003|yeah.|b
me010|uh i don't think our friends uh on wednesday are going to be able to|h|s.%--
me010|well maybe they will.|s^bc
me010|well let me think about whether whether i think we can present this to them or not.|s^co
me010|um|fh
me010|uh|fh
mn015|well i think this is still i mean ad hoc.|s
mn015|this is sort of the second version and i i i look at this maybe just as a you know a a whatever u m l diagram or you know as just a uh screen shot not really as a bayes net as john johno said.|s
me003|we could actually yeah draw it in a different way in the sense that it would make it more abstract.|s^cs
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|but the uh the the nice thing is that you know it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has clearly have to be specified more carefully.|s
mn015|and uh|%-
me010|all right well let me think about this some more.|fg|s^co
me010|and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them.|fh|s
mn015|i mean ultimately we we may|fg|s.%--
mn015|we regard this as sort of an exercise in in thinking about the problem.|s
mn015|and maybe a first version of uh a module if you want to call it that that you can ask|s.%--
mn015|that you can give input.|s
mn015|and it'll uh throw the dice for you.|s
mn015|uh throw the die for you.|s^bc
mn015|because um i integrated this into the existing smartkom system in in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh this thing.|s^df
mn015|close this down.|s^t1
mn015|so if this is what m three l um will look like and what it'll give us.|s
mn015|um|fh
mn015|and a very simple thing.|s
mn015|we have an action that he wants to go from somewhere which is some type of object to someplace.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|and this these uh this changed now only um um|s.%--
mn015|it's doing it twice now because it already did it once.|s
mn015|um we'll add some action type which in this case is approach and could be you know more refined uh in many ways.|fh|s^cc
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me010|good.|b
mn015|or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place.|s
mn015|and it will give us then of course an action type of the type enter.|s
mn015|so this is just based on this one um on this one feature.|s^bs
mn015|and that's that's about all you can do.|s
mn015|and so in the|s.%--
mn015|if this if the object type um here is is a is a landmark of course it'll be um vista.|s
mn015|and um this is about as much as we can do if we don't if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify okay if it's this and this but that is not the case and so forth it just gets really really messy.|fh|s
me010|okay i'm sorry.|fg
me010|you're you're|%--
mn015|huh?|qw
me010|it was much too quick for me.|s
me010|okay so let me see if i understand what you're saying.|s^co
me010|so i i do understand that uh you can take the m three l and add not and it|fh|s^bs.%--
me010|and you need to do this for sure.|s^co
me010|we have to add you know not too much about um object types and stuff.|s^cc
me010|and what i think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say if it's of type landmark then you take you're going to take a picture of it.|s^bu
mn015|exactly.|s^aa
me010|full stop.|s
me010|i mean that's what you do.|s
me010|every landmark you take a picture of.|s
mn015|every public place you enter and statue you want to go as near as possible.|s
me010|you enter.|s
me010|you approach.|s^2
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|uh and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing smartkom system.|fh|s
me010|and you just did.|s
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and it it would do us no good.|s
mn015|that.|s
me010|uh|h
mn015|ultimately.|s
me010|well so well and let's think about this.|fg|s^co
me010|um that's a that's another kind of baseline case.|fh|s
me010|that's another sort of thing okay here's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this.|s
me010|add extra properties|s.%--
me010|a deterministic rule for every property.|s
me010|you have an action pppt.|s
me010|you do that.|s
me010|um then the question would be|fh|s.%--
me010|uh now if that's all you're doing then you can get the types from the ontology.|fh|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me010|because that's all you're all you're using is this type the types in the ontology and you're done.|s^df
mn015|huh?|qw^rt
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|so we don't we don't use the discourse we don't use the context we don't do any of those things.|s
mn015|no.|s^aa
me010|all right but that's but that's okay and i mean it's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things.|s
me010|and that's something the uh smartkom people themselves would|s.%--
me010|they'd say sure that's no problem.|s
me010|you know no problem to add types to the|s.%--
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|no.|s^ar
mn015|and|%--
mn015|this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very very easily is um|s.%--
mn015|we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw and we have our content.|s
mn015|now the content|s.%--
me010|huh.|b
mn015|i which is sort of what what we see here which is sort of the vista schema source path goal whatever.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|this will um be um a job to find ways of writing down image schema x schema constructions in some some form.|s
mn015|and have this be in a in a in the content.|s
mn015|loosely called constructicon.|s
mn015|and the rules we want to throw away completely.|s
mn015|and um and here is exactly where what's going to be replaced with our bayes net.|fh|s
mn015|which is exactly getting the input feeding into here.|s
mn015|this decides whether it's whether action|s.%--
mn015|the the enter.|s
mn015|the vista.|s
mn015|or the whatever.|s
me010|uh approach you called it i think this time.|s^bsc
mn015|uh approach um construction should be activated i e just pasted in.|s
me010|that's what you said.|s
me010|yeah that's fine.|s^ba
me010|yeah but|fg
me010|right.|fg
me010|but it's not construction there it's action.|s^nd
me010|construction is a is a different story.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me003|right.|b
me003|this is uh|s.%--
me003|so what we'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the for the x schema?|qy^d^rt
me010|for for for|s^2.%-
me010|yes.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|b
me010|so that that uh|s.%--
me010|if you had the generalized go x schema.|s
me010|and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones then you would have to supply the parameters.|s
me003|right.|b
me010|and then uh although we haven't worried about this yet you might want to worry about something that would go to the g i s.|s^cs
me010|and use that to actually get you know detailed route planning.|s^cs
me010|so you know where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that.|fh|s^e
me003|uhhuh.|b
me010|but that's not it's not the immediate problem.|s
me003|right.|b
me010|but presumably that that that functionality's there when when we|fh|s.%--
me003|so the immediate problem is just deciding which|s^bu.%-
mn015|aspects of the x schema to add.|s^2
me010|yeah so the the immediate problem is is back to what you were what you are doing with the belief net.|fg|s
me003|yeah.|b
me010|you know uh what are we going to use to make this decision?|fh|qh
me003|right and then once we've made the decision how do we put that into the content?|qh
me010|yeah.|b
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|well that that actually is relatively easy in this case.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|the harder problem is we decide what we want to use how are we going to get it.|s
me010|and that the the that's the hardest problem.|s
me010|so the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology.|s
me010|the|%--
me010|so i think that's the hardest problem at the moment is is|s.%--
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|where are you going to|s.%--
me010|how are you going to get this information.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|and that's so getting back to here.|s^t^tc
me010|uh we have a a technical problem with the belief nets that we we don't want all the|fh|s.%--
me003|there's just too many factors right now.|s^2
me010|too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially.|s^m
me003|right.|b
me010|so we want to think about which ones we really care about.|s
me010|and what they really most depend on.|s
me010|and can we you know clean this this up to the point where it|s.%-
me003|so what we really want to do|s^bu.%--
me003|because this is really just the three layer net we want to make it expand it out into more layers basically?|qy^bu^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|we might.|s^am
me010|uh i mean that that's certainly one thing we can do.|fh|s
me010|uh it's true that the way you have this a lot of the times you have|fh|s.%--
me010|what you're having is the values rather than the variable.|s
me010|so uh|fh
me003|right.|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
me003|so instead of instead it should really be just be intention as a node instead of intention business or intention tour.|s^bu
me010|so you|%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|fg
me010|and then it would have values uh tour business or uh hurried.|s^e
me003|right.|s^aa
me010|but then but it still some knowledge design to do about how do you want to break this up what really matters.|s
me003|right.|b
me010|i mean it's fine.|s^ba
me010|you know we have to it's it's iterative.|s
me010|we're going to have to work with it some.|s^cc
me003|i think what was going through my mind when i did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention.|s
me003|and|fh
me003|the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time|s.%-
me010|well you you could do that.|s
me010|and it's perfectly okay to uh insist that that you know um they add up to one.|s
me010|but that there's uh that that it doesn't have to be one zero zero.|s^e
me003|huh.|s^bk
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me010|so you could have the conditional|s^cs.%--
me010|so|fh
me010|the each of these things is going to be a a a probability.|s
me010|so whenever there's a choice|s.%--
me010|uh|fh
me010|so like landmark ness and usefulness.|s
me003|well see i don't think those would be mutually|s^nd.%--
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me003|it seems like something could both be|s.%-
me010|absolutely right.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|and so that you might want to then have those|s^cs.%--
me010|then they may have to be separate.|s
me010|they may not be able to be values of the same variable.|s
mn015|object type.|s^2
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that's|%--
me010|but again this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|it's you know it's great is is you know as one step toward uh toward where we want to go.|s
mn015|also it strikes me that we we may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a uh a specification for some interface here that um takes the normal m three l looks at it.|s^cs
mn015|then we discussed in our pre edu e d u meeting um how to ask the ontology what to ask the ontology.|s
mn015|um the fact that we can pretend we have one make a dummy until we get the real one.|fh|s
mn015|and so um we we may want to decide we can do this from here.|fh|s^cs
mn015|but we also could do it um you know if we have a a a belief net interface.|s^e
mn015|so the belief net takes as input a vector.|s
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|of stuff.|s^e
mn015|and it|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|and um it output is whatever as well.|s^rt
mn015|but this information is just m three l.|fh|s^rt
mn015|and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology.|s
mn015|and we want to look up some more stuff in the|s.%--
mn015|maybe we want to ask the real world.|s^cs
mn015|maybe you want to look something up in the g r s.|s^cs^rt
mn015|but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some some stuff.|s
mn015|based on|%--
mn015|we we have uh|s.%--
mn015|i was just made some examples from the ontology.|s
mn015|and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a a a building and it has doors and stuff like this.|s
mn015|but it is also an institution so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth.|s
mn015|and we get relations out of it and once we have them we can use that information to look in the dialogue history.|s
mn015|were any of these things that that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned?|qy^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b
mn015|were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned?|qy^rt
me012|right.|b
mn015|and so forth.|s
mn015|and maybe draw some inferences on that.|s^cs
mn015|so this may be a a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector that we feed into the belief net.|s^rt
mn015|and then|%-
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|i think that's i think that's exactly right.|s
me010|there will be rules but they aren't rules that come to final decisions they're rules that gather information for a decision process.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|no i think that's that's just fine.|s^ba
me010|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
me010|so they'll they presumably there'll be a thread or process or something that|s.%-
me010|agent yeah agent whatever you want to say yeah.|s^m^na
me010|that uh is rule driven and can can uh can do things like that.|s^e
me010|and um there's an issue about whether there will be that'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision.|fh|s
me010|so it probably will.|s
me010|my guess is it'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information run it through a a this belief net that|s.%-
me010|turn a crank in the belief net.|s^m
me010|that'll come out with uh more another vector.|s
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end.|s
me010|so you now know what you're going to do.|s
me010|and that may actually involve getting more information.|fh|s
me010|so once you pull that out it could be that that says uh.|s:s^fe
me010|now that we know that we going to go ask the ontology something else.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me010|now that we know that it's a bus trip.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me010|we didn't we didn't need to know beforehand uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever but but now that we know that's the way it's coming out then we got to go find out more.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|so i think that's okay.|s^ba
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so this is actually if if we were to build something that is um|s.%--
mn015|and uh i had one more thing.|h|s
mn015|the it needs to do|s.%--
mn015|yeah|fh
mn015|i think we i i can come up with a a code for a module that we call the cognitive dispatcher which does nothing.|s^cc
me010|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn015|but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out.|s
mn015|there's this is maybe something that this module can do something that this module can do.|s
mn015|and then collect uh sub objects and then recombine them and put them together.|s
mn015|so maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it and uh get this part.|s^cs
me010|oh okay.|s^bk
me010|uh|fg
mn015|then|%--
mn015|yeah.|s
me010|i confess i'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story.|s
me010|um|h
me010|this this is not a complaint this is a promise to do more work.|s^cc
me010|so i'm going to have to think about it some more.|s
me010|um in particular|fh|s.%--
me010|see what we'd like to do and and this has been implicit in the discussion is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of reuse.|s
me010|so what you're trying to get out of this deep cognitive linguistics is the fact that if you know about source source paths and goals and nnn all this sort of stuff that a lot of this is the same for different tasks.|fh|s
me010|and that uh there's there's some some important generalities that you're getting.|s
me010|so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and have to redo it.|s
me010|and i don't yet see how that goes.|s
me010|all right.|s.%
mn015|there're no primitives upon which uh|s.%-
me010|what are the primitives and how do you break this|qw.%--
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|so i i'm just just there saying eee well you i know how to do any individual case.|s
me010|right?|qy^d^g
me010|but i don't yet|s.%--
me010|see what's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to get powerful generalizations.|s
me010|and|fh
mn015|yep.|b
me010|um|fh
mn015|maybe we|s^cs.%--
mn015|should we add then the what's this domain?|qy:qw^rt
mn015|i mean we have to.|s
mn015|how do i get to x.|s:qw
mn015|then we also have the what's this domain where we get some slightly different|s.%--:qw.%--
me012|right.|b
me010|could uh|qy.%-
mn015|um johno actually does not allow us to call them intentions anymore.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|so he he dislikes the term.|s
me010|well i i don't like the term either so i have|s.%--
me010|uh|fg
me010|it uh|%--
mn015|but um i'm sure the what's this questions also create some interesting x schema aspects.|fg|s
me010|could be.|s^am
mn015|so|fh
me010|i'm not a i'm not particularly opposed to adding that or any other task.|s
me010|i mean eventually we're going to want a whole range of them.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
me012|that's right.|s^aa
me010|uh|h
me010|i'm just saying that i'm going to have to do some sort of first principles thinking about this.|s^cc
me010|i just at the moment don't know.|s^no
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|no.|s^ar
me010|well no the bayes the bayes nets|s^ar|s.%-
me010|the bayes nets will be specific for each decision.|s^m
me010|but what i'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties that will go into different bayes nets be the uh general.|s
me010|so that if you have sources you have trajectors and stuff like that.|s
me010|and there's a language for talking about trajectors.|s^e
me010|you shouldn't have to do that differently.|s
me010|for uh uh going to something than for circling it.|s
me010|for uh telling someone else how to go there.|s
mn015|getting out of|s^2.%-
me010|whatever it is.|s
me010|so that that the the decision processes are going to be different.|s
me010|what you'd really like of course is the same thing you'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs.|s
me010|so all sorts of different tasks and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on.|fh|s
me010|and that's that would be the really pretty result.|fh|s
me010|and pushing it one step further when you get to construction grammar and stuff what you'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh smartkom.|fh|s
me010|that that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there's uh something about the intent.|s
me010|you know the actual what people want to do or what they're referring to and stuff.|s
me010|independent of whether it about what is this or where is it or something that you could tell from the construction you could pull out deep semantic information which you're going to use in a general way.|s
me010|so that's the|s.%-
me010|you might.|s^am
me010|you might.|s^am^r
me010|you might be able to to uh|s.%--
me010|say that this this is the kind of construction in which the|s.%--
me010|there's let's say there's a uh|s.%--
me010|there the the the construction implies the there's a this thing is being viewed as a container.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|so just from this local construction you know that you're going to have to treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information.|s
me010|and that may effect the way you process everything else.|s
me010|so if you say how do i get into the castle.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|then um|%--
me010|or you know what is there in the castle or|s.%--
me010|so there's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container.|s
me010|and you'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle's referred to as a container you crank up the appropriate stuff.|s
me010|independent of what the goal is and independent of what the surrounding language is.|s^e
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|all right so that's that's the that's the thesis level.|s^tc
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh|fh
mn015|it's unfortunate also that english has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs.|s
mn015|because they're really fancy then in in for these kinds of analysis.|s^df
mn015|but uh|fh
me010|well you have prepositional phrases that|s^ng.%-
mn015|yeah but they're they're easier for parsers.|s^aap
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|parsers can pick those up but but the with the spatial adverbs they have a tough time.|s
mn015|because the the semantics are very complex in that.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|okay yeah.|b
mn015|i had one more thing.|s^t1
mn015|i don't remember.|s^no
mn015|i just forgot it again.|s
mn015|no.|h
mn015|oh yeah!|s^fe
mn015|but an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else or whatever.|s
mn015|so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we're we're we're talking about that are independent of the problem.|s
mn015|that generalize over those problems and are oh of a higher quality than any actual whatever um belief net or x that we may use for the decision making ultimately.|s
mn015|should be decoupled yeah.|s
mn015|okay.|b
me010|right.|b
me010|so are we going to be meeting here from now on?|fg|qy^rt
me010|i'm i'm happy to do that.|s
me010|we we had talked about it because you have the display and everything that seems fine.|s
mn015|yeah um liz also asks whether we're going to have presentations every time.|s
mn015|i don't think we will need to do that but it's|s.%-
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|so far i think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and and|s.%-
me010|oh yeah!|s^fe
me010|no i i think it's worth it to to meet here to bring this and assume that something may come up that we want to look at.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|i mean why not.|s
mn015|and um|h
mn015|yeah that was my|fh|s.%-
me010|she was good.|s^ba
me010|litonya was good.|s^ba^rt
mn015|yeah?|qh
mn015|the uh um she she was definitely good in the sense that she she showed us some of the weaknesses.|fh|s^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|and um also the um the fact that she was a real subject you know is is|fh|s.%-
me010|right.|fg
me010|yeah and and and yeah and and she took it seriously and stuff.|fh|s
me010|no it was great.|s^ba
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|so i think that um i mean|s.%--
mn015|looking just looking at this data listening to it what can we get out of it in terms of our problem.|s
mn015|for example is you know she actually said you know she never just spoke about entering she just wanted to get someplace and she said for buying stuff.|s
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|so this is definitely interesting and|s.%--
me012|yeah right.|s^aa
mn015|um and in the other case where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti.|fh|s^rt
mn015|also of course not in the sentence how do you get there was pretty standard.|s
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|except that there was a nice anaphora you know for pointing at what she talked about before.|s
mn015|and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls.|s
mn015|so|fh
me012|right.|b
mn015|actually you'd need a lot of world knowledge.|s
mn015|this would have been a classical um uh tango actually.|s
mn015|um because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside.|fh|s^df
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|but|fh
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so the mistake would have make a mistake the system would have made a mistake here.|s
me012|yep.|b
me010|click.|s
me010|all right.|b
