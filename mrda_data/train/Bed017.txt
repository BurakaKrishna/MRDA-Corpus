fe004|why?|z
me003|i'm known i|z
fn050|um.|z
fe004|no because she already told me it before she told you.|z
me003|no she told me a long time ago she told me she told me like two weeks ago.|z
fe004|oh well it doesn't matter what time.|z
mn015|okay.|z
mn015|you know how to toggle the display width function|z
fn050|wow.|z
fe004|well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet.|z
fe004|anyway.|z
fn050|what is it?|z
me003|let me explain something to you.|z
fn050|um|z
me003|my laugh is better than yours.|z
fn050|there.|z
mn015|yo.|z
fe004|i beg to differ.|z
fn050|um okay.|z
fe004|but you have to say something genuinely funny before you'll get an example.|z
me003|yeah.|z
fn050|the thing is i don't know how to get to the next page here.|z
me003|no.|z
me003|you should be at least be self satisfied enough to laugh at your own jokes.|z
fn050|actually i thought|z
fn050|there.|z
fe004|no it's a different laugh.|z
fn050|how weird.|z
fe004|ooh wow!|z
me003|oh holy mackerel.|z
fe004|wow whoa!|z
fn050|what?!|z
fn050|oh.|z
fn050|okay i|z
fn050|wasn't even doing anything okay.|z
fe004|uh.|z
me003|eva's got a laptop she's trying to show it off.|z
fn050|that was actually robert's idea but anyhow.|z
fn050|um|z
me010|okay so here we are.|fg|s^t^tc
me003|once again.|s^2
me010|once again.|s^m
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|together.|s
me010|um so we haven't had a meeting for a while.|fh|s
me010|and and probably won't have one next week.|s^e
me010|i think a number of people are gone.|s^df
me010|um so robert why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with e d u?|fh|qh^co^t
mn015|um|h
mn015|uh in a in a smaller group we had uh talked and decided about continuation of the data collection.|s^rt
mn015|so fey's time with us is almost officially over.|s
mn015|and she brought us some thirty subjects and collected the data.|fh|s
mn015|and ten dialogues have been transcribed.|s
mn015|and can be looked at.|s^rt
mn015|if you're interested in that talk to me.|s^co^rt
mn015|um and we found another uh cogsci student who's interested in playing wizard for us.|fh|s
mn015|here we're going to make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects uh this round.|s
mn015|she's actually suggested to look um at the psychology department students.|s^cs
mn015|because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements.|s^df
mn015|so they have to be subjected before they can actually graduate.|s^df^e
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time.|s
mn015|two days for example.|s^e
mn015|to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time.|s^e
mn015|and|fh
mn015|um sort of package the whole thing in a in a in a few more complicated um structure.|fh|s^e
mn015|that's for the data collection.|s^rt
mn015|as for smartkom i'm the last smartkom meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis.|s
mn015|which as of this morning should be resolved.|s^rt
me010|good.|s^ba
mn015|and so|fh
mn015|should be means they aren't yet.|s:s
mn015|but but i think i have the info now that i need.|s^rt
mn015|plus johno and i are meeting tomorrow.|s
mn015|so maybe uh uh when tomorrow is over we're done.|s^am
mn015|and we'll never have to look at it again.|s
mn015|maybe it'll take some more time.|s^am
mn015|to be realistic.|s^e
mn015|but at least we're we're seeing the end of the tunnel there.|s
mn015|that was that.|s^rt^tc
mn015|um|fh
mn015|the uh|%--
mn015|uh i don't think we need to discuss the formalism.|fh|s
mn015|that'll be done officially once we're done.|s^df^rt
mn015|um|fh
mn015|something happened in on eva's side with the p r m that we're going to look at today.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|we have a visitor from bruchsal from the international university.|s^rt
mn015|andreas i think you've met everyone except nancy.|s
fe004|sorry.|fg
mn059|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|hi hi.|s
mn015|hi hi.|s^m
mn015|and um|fh
fe004|so when you said andreas i thought you were talking about stolcke.|s
fe004|now i know that we aren't.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|andy you actually go by andy.|s^bu
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn059|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|oh okay.|s^bk
mn059|because there is another andreas around.|s
mn015|uh|fh.%
fe004|huh.|b
mn059|so to avoid some confusion.|s
mn015|that will be reuter?|qy^bu^rt
mn059|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|oh okay.|s^bk
mn015|so my scientific director of the e m l is also the dean of the international university.|s
mn015|one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|the|%--
mn015|um he might tell us a little bit about what he's actually doing.|fh|s^t
mn015|and why it is somewhat related.|s
mn015|and by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using.|s^df
mn015|and um was that enough of an update?|fh|qy^rt
me010|i think so.|s^aa
mn015|in what order shall we proceed?|qy^t^tc
fn050|okay.|s
mn015|maybe you have your online|s^cs.%--
fn050|uh|h
fn050|yeah sure.|s^aa
fn050|um so i've just been looking at um|fg|s.%--
fn050|ack!|s^fe
fn050|what are you doing?|qh
fn050|yeah.|b
fn050|okay.|fh
fn050|um|fh
fn050|i've been looking at the p r m stuff.|s
fn050|um|fh
fn050|so this is sort of like the latest thing i have on it.|s
fn050|and|fh
fn050|i sort of constructed a couple of classes.|s
fn050|like a user class a site class and and you know a time a route and then and a query class.|s^e
fn050|and i tried to simplify it down a little bit.|s
fn050|so that i can actually um look at it more.|s^df
fn050|it's the same paper that i gave to jerry last time.|s
fn050|um|fh
fn050|so basically i took out a lot of stuff a lot of the decision nodes.|s
fn050|and then tried to|s.%--
fn050|the red lines on the um graph are the um relations between the different um classes.|s
fn050|like a user has like a query.|s
fn050|and then also has you know um reference slots to its preferences.|s
fn050|um the special needs and you know money and the user interest.|fh|s^e
fn050|and so|fh
fn050|this is more or less similar to the flat bayes net that i have you know with the input nodes and all that.|s
fn050|and|fh
fn050|so i tried to construct the dependency models.|s
fn050|and|fh
fn050|a lot of these stuff i got from the flat bayes net.|s^rt
fn050|and what they depend on.|s^e^rt
fn050|and it turns out you know the c p t's are really big if i do that.|s^df
fn050|so i tried to see how i can do um put in the computational nodes in between.|s
fn050|and what that would look like in a p r m.|s^e
fn050|and so i ended up making several classes.|s
fn050|actually you know a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes.|s^bc
fn050|and one of them is like time affordability money affordability site availability and the travel compatibility.|s^e
fn050|and so some of these classes are|s.%--
fn050|some of these attributes only depend on stuff from say the user.|s^rt
fn050|or just from i don't know like the site.|s^e
fn050|like um these here.|s
fn050|it's only like user.|s^e
fn050|but if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors you need to look at a pair of you know what the um preference of the user is.|s
fn050|versus you know what type of an event it is.|s^e
fn050|or you know which form of transportation the user has.|s^e
fn050|and whether you know the onsite parking matters to the user in that case.|s^e
fn050|and that makes the scenario a little different in a p r m.|fh|s
fn050|because um then you have one user objects.|s^df
fn050|and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind.|s
fn050|and so|fh
fn050|for each of the site you'll come up with this rating of travel compatibility.|s
fn050|and they all depend on the same users but different sites.|fh|s
fn050|and that makes a|s.%--
fn050|i'm i i have been trying to see whether the p r m would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that.|s
fn050|and so|fh
fn050|i guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat bayes net.|s
fn050|because otherwise you would|s^df.%--
fn050|well it's probably the same.|s
fn050|but um|fh
fn050|no you would definitely have|s.%--
fn050|be able to re use like um all the user stuff.|s^bc
fn050|and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff.|s
fn050|because it's all from the user side.|s^df
fn050|so if you changed sites you you can you know save some work on that.|s
fn050|but|fh
fn050|you know in the case where it depends on both the user and the site then i'm still having a hard time trying to see how um using the p r m will help.|s
fn050|um so anyhow using those intermediate nodes then this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes.|fh|s
fn050|and that would basically it's just another class in the model.|s
fn050|with you know references to the user and the site and the time.|s^e
fn050|and then after you group them together this|s.%--
fn050|the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this.|s
fn050|and so you know it's easier to specify the c p t and all.|s
fn050|um so i think that's about as far as i've gone on the p r m stuff.|fh|s
me010|well|s^ar.%--
fn050|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|no.|s^ar^rt
me010|so you didn't yet tell us what the output is.|s^df
fn050|the output.|s^m
me010|so what decisions does this make?|qw
fn050|okay so it only makes two decisions in this model.|fg|s
fn050|and one is basically how desirable a site is.|s
fn050|meaning um how good it matches the needs of a user.|s^e
fn050|and the other is the mode of the visit.|s
fn050|whether it's the e v a decision.|s^e
fn050|um|fh
fn050|so instead of um doing a lot of you know computation about you know which one site it wants of the user wants to visit i'll come well try to come up with like sort of a list of sites.|s^cc^rt
fn050|and for each site you know where how how well it fits.|s
fn050|and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it.|s
fn050|so|fh
fn050|anything else i missed?|qy^t
me010|so that was pretty quick.|s
me010|she's uh uh eva's got a little write up on it.|s
me010|that uh probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|so|fh
me010|the you you didn't look at all yet to see if there's anybody has a implementation?|qy^bu^d
fn050|no not yet.|s^aa
fn050|um|fh
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so one so one of the questions you know about these p r m's is|s.%--
fn050|uhhuh.|b^rt
me010|uh we aren't going to build our own interpreter.|h|s^cc
me010|so if if we can't find one then we uh go off and do something else and wait until one appears.|s^cs
me010|uh so one of the things that eva's going to do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down.|fh|s
me010|uh|fh
me010|the people at stanford write papers as if they had one.|s
me010|but um we'll see.|fh|s^am
me010|so anyway so that's a a major open issue.|s
me010|if there is an interpreter it looks like you know what eva's got should run.|s
me010|and we should be able to actually um try to solve you know the problems.|s
me010|to actually take the data and do it.|s^e
me010|uh and we'll see.|fh|s^am
me010|uh i actually think it is cleaner.|s
me010|and the ability to instantiate you know instance of people and sites and stuff um will help in the expression.|s
me010|whether the inference gets any faster or not i don't know.|s^no
me010|uh it wouldn't surprise me if it if it doesn't.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
me010|you know it's the same kind of information.|s
me010|i think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief net.|s
me010|uh without going to some incredible hacking.|fh|s^e
me010|of sort of rebuilding it on the fly.|s^e
me010|i mean the notion of instantiating your elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief net.|s
me010|so that was one of the main reasons for doing it.|s^df
me010|um|fh
me010|i don't know.|s^tc
me010|so uh people who have thought about the problem like robert|fh|s.%--
me010|it looked to me like if eva were able to come up with a you know value for each of a number of uh sites plus its e v a thing.|s^cs
me010|that a travel planner should be able to take it from there.|s^e
me010|and you know with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever.|fh|s
me010|and then plan a route.|s
mn015|uhhuh um well first of all uh uh great looks much cleaner.|s
mn015|nnn nnn|%
mn015|certain certain beauty in it.|s
mn015|so um if beauty is truth then uh we're in good shape.|s
mn015|but|fh
mn015|the um|%--
mn015|as uh mentioned before we probably should look at the details.|s^cs
mn015|so if you have a write up then uh i'd love to read it.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and uh|fh
mn015|because um|s.%--
mn015|can you go all the way back to the the very top?|qy^rt
fn050|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|um uh these these when these are instantiated they take on the same values that we had before?|fh|qy^rt
fn050|i can't really see the whole thing.|s^t3
mn015|or are they have they changed in a sense?|qrr
fn050|well i think i basically leave them to similar things.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fn050|some of the things might that might be different maybe like are that the hours for the site.|s
mn015|huh|b
fn050|and eventually i meant that to mean whether they're open at this hour or not.|fh|s
fn050|and status would be you know more or less like whether they're under construction.|s:s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fn050|and and or stuff like that.|fh|s
mn015|and the uh other question i would have is that presumably from the way the stanford people talk about it you can put the probabilities also on the relations.|s
mn015|if|%-
fn050|which is the structural uncertainty?|qy^bu^rt
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah i that's|fg|%--
me010|that i think was actually in the previous the ubenth stuff.|s
me010|i don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not.|s^no
fe004|huh|b
me010|uh structural uncertainty.|fh|s
mn015|it's sort of in the definition or in the in daphne's definition of a p r m.|s
mn015|is that classes and relations.|s^e
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and you're going to have c p t's over the classes and their relations.|s^e
me010|all right.|fg
mn015|more uncertainty or or|s.%-
me010|uh|fh
fn050|i remember them learning when you know you don't know the structure for sure.|s
mn015|i should say|s.%-
me010|yeah.|b
fn050|but i don't remember reading how you specify.|s^no
me010|right.|b
mn015|yeah that would be exactly my question.|s
fn050|to start with.|s^e
fn050|yeah.|b
mn015|well|fh
me010|yeah.|b
fn050|yeah.|b
me010|so uh the the plan is is when daphne gets back we'll get in touch.|s^cc
me010|and supposedly um we'll actually get deep seriously connected to to their work.|s
me010|and|fh
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me010|somebody will uh you know if it's a group meeting once a week probably someone will go down and whatever.|s^cs
me010|so we'll actually figure all this out.|s^cc
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn015|then i think the long term perspective is is pretty clear.|s
mn015|we get rocking and rolling on this again once we get a package.|s^co
mn015|if when and how.|s^e:qw
mn015|then this becomes foregrounded.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
mn015|profiled.|s^e
mn015|focused again.|s^e
me003|designated?|qy^rt
fe004|of course.|s^aa
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|until then we'll come up with a something that's that's way more complicated for you.|s^cc^rt
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fn050|okay.|s^aa
mn015|because this was laughingly easy.|s^df
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fn050|actually i had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff.|s^ng
fn050|because i i made it really complicated in the beginning.|s^df
fn050|and jerry was like this is just too much.|fh|s:s
me010|yeah so um|fg
me010|you could from this go on and say suppose there's a group of people traveling together.|s^cs
me010|and you wanted to plan something that somehow with some pareto optimal uh uh thing for|fh|s.%-
fe004|that's good.|s^ba
fe004|that's definitely a job for artificial intelligence.|s^j
me010|uh or|%-
mn015|well that's not not even something humans|s^na.%-
fe004|except for humans can't really solve it either so.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|right.|b
me010|well that's the that would that would be a uh you could sell it as a|s^cs^j.%--
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|okay uh you don't have to fight about this just give your preferences to the|s.%--:s
fe004|and then you can blame the computer.|s
me010|exactly.|s^aa
mn015|huh|b
fe004|so|fh
mn015|but what does it uh would a potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again?|qw^j^rt
mn015|you know.|b
fe004|that should be one of them.|s^j^na
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah right.|s^aa
me003|that'd be nice.|s^ba
fe004|huh|b
me010|anyway.|fg
me010|so so there there are some some uh you know uh elaborations of this.|s
me010|that you could try to put in to this structure.|s^cs^e
me010|but i don't think it's worth it now.|s
me010|because we're going to see what what else uh what else we're going to do.|s^df
me010|anyway.|s^tc
me010|but uh|fh
me010|it's good yeah.|s^ba
me010|and and there were a couple other ideas of of uh things for eva to look at.|s
me010|in in the interim.|s^e
mn015|good then we can move on and see what andreas has got out his sleeve.|fg|s^t^tc
mn015|or andy for that matter.|s^e
mn059|okay so uh uh well thanks for having me here first of all.|fg|s^ft
mn059|um so maybe just a a little background on on my visit.|fh|s
mn059|so uh i'm not really involved in any project that's uh that's relevant to you uh at the moment.|s
mn059|uh the the reason is really for me uh to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field.|s
mn059|and and so i'll just sort of give you a real quick introduction to what i'm working on.|s
mn059|and um i just hope that you have some comments.|fh|s
mn059|or maybe you're interested in it to find out more.|s
mn059|and and so i'll be uh happy to talk to you.|s
mn059|and and uh i'd also like to find out some more.|s
mn059|and and maybe i'll just walk around the office.|s
mn059|and|fh
mn059|and then and ask some some questions uh in a couple days.|s
mn059|so i'll be here for uh tomorrow and then uh the remainder of uh next week.|s
mn059|okay so um what i started looking at uh to begin with is just uh content management systems uh in general.|s
mn059|so|fh
mn059|um uh what's uh sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects.|s
mn059|um and you store meta data uh associate to them.|s
mn059|so there's some international standards.|s
mn059|like the i triple e uh there's an i triple e l o n standard.|s^e
mn059|and um these fields are pretty straightforward you have uh author information you have uh size information format information and so on.|s
mn059|uh but they're two uh fields that are um more interesting.|s
mn059|one is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document.|s^e
mn059|and one is uh you have sort of a um|s^e.%--
mn059|well what is the document about so it's some sort of taxonomic uh ordering of of the of the units.|s
mn059|now if you sort of put on your semantic glasses uh you say well that's not all that easy.|s
mn059|because there's an implicit um uh assumption behind that.|s^df
mn059|is that uh all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh whichever taxonomy is used.|s^e
mn059|and uh|fh
mn059|i think that's a that's a very that's a key point of these systems.|s
mn059|and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that.|s
mn059|and uh as a matter of fact the only thing that apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes.|s
mn059|which are very very coarse grain.|s^e
mn059|so you have some like science biology and then|s.%--
mn059|but that's really all that we have at the moment.|s
mn059|so i think there's a huge um uh need for improvement there.|s
mn059|now what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um sort of uh with a search engine just query uh different repositories all over the world.|s
mn059|but we can't really|s.%--
mn059|um so what i'm what i try to do is um to have um|fh|s.%--
mn059|uh so so the scenario is the following you're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem.|s
mn059|now what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh students um try to program a certain assignment for example.|s^df
mn059|they always run into the same problems.|s^df^e
mn059|uh and they always come running to us.|s^df^e
mn059|and they'll say why's it not it's not working.|s^df^e
mn059|and we always give out the same answer.|s^df^e
mn059|so we thought well it'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this.|s:s
mn059|and so what i want to build is basically a a smart f a q system.|s
mn059|now what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information.|s^co
mn059|which is more elaborate than i'm looking for this and this and this keyword.|s^e:s
mn059|so|fh
mn059|and i think that i don't need to tell you this.|s
mn059|i'm i'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain uh context.|s
mn059|it and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference.|s
mn059|so i want to be able to model information like um so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems of at a computer science school.|fh|s^cs
mn059|um what kind of software is the person using.|fh|s:qw
mn059|which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment.|s:qw
mn059|um maybe what's the background of that student's.|s:qw
mn059|um which um which error message was encountered.|fh|s:qw
mn059|so this sort of information i think should be transmitted uh when a certain document is retrieved.|s
mn059|now|fh
mn059|um|fh
mn059|basically giving this um uh|s.%--
mn059|so we somehow need to have a formalized um way of writing this down basically.|s^cs
mn059|and that's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again.|s
mn059|and using this and some some uh knowledge about the domain i think you can do some some simple inferences.|fh|s
mn059|like you know that when somebody's working about uh working on on servlets for example.|s
mn059|he's using java because servlets are used are written in java.|s^e
mn059|so some some inferences like that.|s
mn059|now um using this you can infer more information.|fh|s
mn059|and you could then match this to the meta data of um off the documents you're you're searching against.|s^cs
mn059|so uh what i want to do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs.|s^cs
mn059|and then i can compute how many documents match.|s^rt
mn059|and use this as a metric in the search.|s
mn059|now what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results.|s^cs
mn059|and i want to do this by having a depth uh um um steepest descent approach.|s
mn059|so if i knew which operating system the person was working on would this improve my search result.|s:qw
mn059|and and having uh uh a symbolic formalized model of this i could simply compute that.|s
mn059|and find out which um which questions are worth um asking.|s
mn059|and that's what i then propagate back to the user.|s
mn059|and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way.|s
mn059|now the big problem that i'm facing right now is um it's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly that that works in the small domain.|s
mn059|but the problem is obviously the scalability.|s
mn059|and uh uh so robert was mentioning uh earlier today is that uh microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a bayesian network.|fh|s
mn059|which does exactly this.|s^e
mn059|but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend.|s
mn059|and so uh what i'm what i try to do is basically try to model this uh in a way that you could really combine uh knowledge from very different sources.|s
mn059|and and um sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh came up with.|fh|s
mn059|trying to to have uh an approach how to integrate uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules.|s
mn059|um what you can do with those.|s^e
mn059|um|fh
mn059|what i'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this.|s
mn059|because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure.|s^df
mn059|so it's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh computational model.|s^ba
mn059|that that probably isn't expressive enough.|s^e
mn059|so so that's another thing.|s
mn059|um which i think you're also uh uh looking into right now.|s^rt
mn059|and then um uh sort of as an add on to this whole idea um uh that would be|s.%--
mn059|now depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which um uh which uh rules and which ontologies it it uses or basically its view of the world uh you can get very different results.|s^df
mn059|so it might make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines.|s
mn059|and there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach.|s
mn059|where we're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves.|s^e
mn059|and um if you have a question about a homework it's probably makes sense to ask somebody who's in your class with you sort of the guru in the certain area.|s
mn059|rather than going to some yahoo like uh search engine.|s^e
mn059|so these are some of the just in a nutshell some of the ideas.|s
mn059|and i think a lot of the even though it's a it's a very different domain but i think a lot of the um issues are are fairly similar.|s
mn059|so|fh
mn059|okay.|s^rt^tc
fe004|and so some of the i don't know how much you know about the larger heidelberg project.|s
fe004|i are you|qy.%-
mn059|uh i know yeah i know about it.|s
fe004|so it seems like a lot of some of the issues are the same.|s
fe004|it's like um you know the context based factors that influence how you interpret|s.%--
mn059|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
fe004|um how to interpret|fh|s.%--
fe004|in in this case in knowing wanting to know what kinds of things to ask.|s
fe004|we've kind of talked about that.|s
fe004|but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe004|but maybe you guys had that in the previous models.|s
mn015|well in a in one one huh small difference in a in a way is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer.|s
mn015|but he wants to point to the places|s.%-
mn059|yeah so so i'm i'm not i'm not building an expert.|fg|s
fe004|documents that have the answers.|s^2
mn059|uh i want to build a smart librarian basically.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn059|that can point you to the right reference.|s^e
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn059|i don't want to compute the answer.|s
mn059|so it's a little bit easier for me.|s^ba
mn015|well uh you have to still understand what the content says about itself and then match it to what you think the informational needs.|s^ng
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn059|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so you also don't have to figure out what the content is.|s^bu
fe004|you're just taking the keywords as a topic text.|s^bu
mn059|i i assume that that there will be learning systems that that tag their their content.|s^na
fe004|as|%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn059|and um um|fh
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn059|and basically what i what i envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an f a q for example you could state sort of like a logic condition when this document applies.|s^cs
mn059|so this document explains how to set up your uh mail account on linux or something like this.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn059|so so something something very specific that you can then|s.%--
mn059|but the i think that the key point with these uh learning systems is that uh a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries.|s
fe004|huh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn059|you can have the best learning system with the best search interface.|s
mn059|if there's no content inside of it it's not very useful.|s
mn059|so i think ultimately because um uh developing these these rules and these inference uh inferences i think is very costly.|s
mn059|so um uh i think you must be able to reuse some some existing um domain domain information or or or ontologies that that uh other people wrote.|fh|s^cs
mn059|and then try to integrate them.|s^e
mn059|and then also search the entire web basically rather than just the small uh content management system.|s^e
fe004|okay.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn059|so i think that's that's crucial for for the success of or|s.%-
fe004|so you're not|s.%--
fe004|i guess i'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we've talked about in this group and actually associated groups.|s
mn059|uhhuh.|b
fe004|because some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses.|s^df
fe004|and i'm guessing that you you won't be doing that.|s^bu^rt
mn059|no.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|just checking.|s^df
fe004|so okay|fh
mn015|huh|b
mn059|no.|s^aa^r
fe004|so you take the query and and|s.%--
me010|on the other hand uh framenet could well be useful.|s^cs
me010|so do you know the framenet story?|qy^rt
mn059|um yeah.|h|s^aa
mn059|uh not not too much.|h|s^aap
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn059|but uh|%--
me010|oh that's another thing you might want to look into while you're here.|s^cs
mn059|i have a rough overview.|s^e
me010|because um you know the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames and the frames may well give you additional keywords.|s^df
me010|or uh if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords uh indicate a frame then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame rather than just uh individual|s.%--
mn059|huh huh|b
me010|so there's a lot of stuff.|s
me010|and people are looking at that.|s
me010|most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right.|s
me010|there's linguists and stuff.|s^e
me010|and there's a lot of it.|s^e
me010|and they're they're busily working away.|s
me010|but there are some application efforts trying to exploit it.|s
me010|and this looks it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that.|s^cs
mn059|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn059|yeah i'm sure i could learn a lot about um yeah just how to how to come up with these structures.|s
fe004|huh|b
mn059|because it's it's very easy to whip up something quickly.|s
mn059|but it maybe then makes sense to to me but not to anybody else.|s
mn059|and and if we want to share and integrate things they must well they must be well designed really.|s
mn015|remember the uh prashant story?|qy^d^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|the absolutely no no linguistic background person that the i u sent over here.|s^e
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|and andreas and i tried to come up or we had come up actually with a uh with him working on an interface for framenet as it was back then that would do some of the work for this machine.|s^e
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|which uh never got done because prashant found a happy occupation.|s^e
me010|yeah i know i mean it it he he did what what he did was much more sensible for him.|s
mn015|which in the|s^e.%-
me010|i think uh|s.%-
mn015|absolutely yeah.|s^aa
mn015|but so i'm just saying the uh we had that idea.|s
me010|you know|fg
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|the idea was there yeah okay.|s^aa
mn015|uh to to exploit framenet there as well.|s^e
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|huh|b
mn015|and um|fh
me010|yeah actually you guys never|s.%-
mn015|and srini's doing information extraction also.|s^bu
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|with that framenet base.|s^e
mn059|huh|b
me010|yeah.|b
me010|so you you guys never sent anybody else from i u.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|you were no|s.%-
mn059|except except prashant?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|uh this was supposedly an exchange program.|fh|s
mn059|um|fh
me010|and i we you know it's fine we don't care.|s
me010|but it just i'm a little surprised that uh andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send.|s
me010|all right.|b
mn059|uh i don't know i mean the uh|s.%-
me010|i mean i had forgotten i to be honest with you i'd totally forgotten we had a program.|s
fe004|huh|b
mn015|uh it's in the program?|qy^d^rt
mn059|uh i i think it's it's really the lack of students uh at i u at the moment.|s^df
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|no no there was a whole there was a little contract signed.|s
me010|it was|%--
me010|yeah.|b
mn059|yeah yeah i think it's it's more the lack of of students really.|s^df^r
mn059|and we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams.|s^df^e
me010|yeah i know.|s^bk
fe004|huh|b
me010|right.|s^aa
mn059|but|fh
me010|right.|b
mn059|well i mean if if i were a student i'd love to come here rather than work for some german company or|s.%--
me010|yeah.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|you are being recorded right now so beware.|s^co
me010|oh right!|s^fe
mn059|well i didn't say anybody to anything to offend.|s
mn059|well except for the sponsors maybe.|s^e
mn059|but|fh
me010|right.|b
me010|anyway.|b
me010|right so i that's that's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you're here.|s^cs
mn059|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh unfortunately srini who is heavily involved in daml and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town.|fh|s
mn059|uhhuh.|b
mn059|well i'll go to the uh semantic web workshop uh in two weeks.|s^cc
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|and|fh
me010|yeah for for some reason he's not doing that.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me010|i don't know why he|s^no.%--
fe004|well he had other things to do.|s^df
me010|oh i who knows?|qh
me010|yeah you'll see you'll certainly see a lot of the people there.|s
fe004|the uh|%-
fe004|the other person i thought of is dan gildea.|s^cs^rt
fe004|because he did some work on topic spotting|s^df.%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|statistical stuff.|s^2
me010|that would be a very good idea.|s^ba
fe004|um which is i mean you i mean i don't depending on how well you want to integrate with that end|fh|s.%--
mn059|uhhuh.|b
fe004|you know like taking the data and you said the learning systems that figure out|s.%--
fe004|we there's someone in icsi who actually has been working on has worked on that kind of stuff.|s^df
fe004|and he's worked with frame net.|s^df
fe004|so you could talk to him about you know both of those things at once.|s
mn059|uhhuh uhhuh|b
fe004|so|fh
fe004|and he just finished writing a draft of his thesis.|s^e
fe004|so|fh
mn059|so uh who is that again?|qw^rt
fe004|dan gildea g i l d e a.|s
fe004|and he's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff.|s^e
mn015|who?|qw^rt
mn015|i can take you to his office.|s^cc
mn015|it's just around the corner.|s
fe004|and|fh
mn059|okay great.|s^bk
fe004|huh|b
fe004|well if you solve the problem hope you can do one for us too.|s
me010|all right was there anything else for this?|fg|qy^rt^t
me010|one of these times soon we're going to hear about construal.|s
mn015|yeah i'm sure.|s^aa
mn015|i have um i think it was november two thousand three or some|s.%--
mn015|no i had something in my calendar.|s
me010|oh okay right.|s^bk
mn015|um|fh
me003|wait a second.|s^co
me003|that's a long way away.|s^df
me010|good thinking!|s^ba^fe
mn015|uh well maybe i can i can bribe my way out of this.|s^j
mn015|so|fh
mn015|so i did some double checking.|s
mn015|and it seems like spring break in two thousand one|s.%-
fe004|talk about changing the topic.|s^j
mn015|no.|s^ar
me010|well no but he's he's he's he's as you said he's like the state legislature he's trying to offer us bribes.|s^df^ng
fe004|at least this is a private meeting.|s^df
fe004|right exactly.|s^aa
fe004|okay that's the link.|s
mn015|this uh oh they refused the budget again?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|is it so about citris?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yeah still nothing.|s^e
me010|uh this this this the|h|s.%--
me010|we're uh involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh program.|s
me010|uh with the state of california.|fh|s^e
me010|and the state of california is now a month and a half behind its its legally required date to approve a budget.|s^df
me010|so the budget has not been approved.|s
me010|and two days ago there's two you know so two branches of legislature one branch approved it.|s
mn059|uhhuh.|b
me010|and um|fh
me010|yesterday day there was this uh uh i thought that the other branch would just approve it.|s
me010|but now there's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there.|s
me010|uh anyway.|s
me010|so um|fh
me010|oh i have to tell you a wonderful story about this.|s^cc
me010|okay?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|and then we'll go.|s^cc
me010|so i it turns out i wound up having lunch today with a guy named tom kalil.|s
me010|k i l l.|s^e
me010|k a l i l.|s^bsc
me010|and uh he now works at berkeley.|fh|s
me010|in fact he's hired to run a lot of citris.|s
me010|even though we don't have the money they so they've been hiring people right and left.|s^e
me010|so uh they think the money's coming.|fh|s
me010|so and he was i think the chief staffer to clinton on technology matters.|s
me010|he was in the white house.|s^e
me010|i don't remember what he was saying.|s^no
me010|anyway like that.|s
me010|and is now doing all the politics for citris.|s
me010|but also has a uh a lot of interest in uh actually doing things for society.|s
me010|so digital divide and stuff like that.|s^e
me010|so that's interesting to me but maybe not to you.|s
me010|but the really interesting thing was he he he said something about you know i'm interested in things that have high social multiplier.|s:s
me010|something that is of great social value.|s^e:s
me010|he said for example|s.%--:s
me010|this was his only example.|s
me010|if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor.|s:s
me010|and as compelling as a video game.|s^e:s
me010|then that would have a huge social impact.|s^e:s
me010|i said oh great that's a good problem to work on.|s:s
me010|anyway so it was nice that uh he's got this view of a that's what you should try to do and b   uh language would be a good way to do it.|fh|s^ba:s
me010|so that's|s.%-
fe004|huh definitely.|s^aa
me010|so anyway that's the end of the story.|s
fe004|but for adults and not for the children.|s
me010|this was|%--
me010|yeah i didn't push him on the on the child thing.|s^na
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but uh|fh
me010|you know again if if you if you|s.%--
fe004|oh.|s^bk
me010|um|fh
me010|and this was this was literacy.|s
me010|which actually is somewhat different problem.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|maybe easier.|s^am
me010|i don't know.|s^no
me010|so this is reading rather than teaching.|s
me010|another project we started on and and didn't get funded for was uh to try to build an automatic tutoring program for kids whose first language wasn't english.|s
me010|which is like half the school population in california.|s^e
me010|something like that.|s^e
me010|isn't it?|qy^d^g^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|so|fh
me010|enormous problem in california.|s
me010|and the idea was if we're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding couldn't we build uh programs that would be tutors for the kids.|fh|s^cs
me010|we think we could.|s
me010|anyway so so but this is a slightly different problem.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and|fh
me010|um|fh
me010|i know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now.|s
me010|but it it's it's interesting.|s^e
me010|and i may um talk to him some more about is somebody already doing this and stuff like that.|s:qy
me010|so anyway that was that was today's little story.|s^tc
me003|huh|b
mn015|okay so i i did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into citris.|fg|s
me010|no no.|s^ar
mn015|but uh or temporarily putting it out of the sling.|s^bsc
me010|right.|b
mn015|but i i'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that i am uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings.|s
me010|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|and also revising|s^e.%--
mn015|thanks for all the comments.|s^ft
mn015|the the original construal proposal.|s^e
mn015|and if i put one and one together i may end up with a number that's greater than one and that i i can potentially present once you get back.|s
fe004|greater than two?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|you're good.|s^ba
mn015|nnn sometimes you know the sum is not uh less than the|s^nd.%-
fe004|uh right right.|s^aa
me010|right.|b
me010|right.|b
me010|anyway yeah so okay so that'd be great.|fg|s^ba
me010|but i'd i think it's it's time again.|s
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|absolutely yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah okay.|s^bk
mn015|but um and hopefully all sidetracking um other things will have disappeared soon.|s
me010|good.|s^bk
me010|yep.|s^bk
me010|done?|qy^d^rt
