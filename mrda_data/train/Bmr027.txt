me011|okay.|z
me018|adam what is the mike that uh jeremy's wearing?|z
me011|it's the ear plug mike.|z
me018|okay.|z
fe016|that's good.|z
fe008|ear plug.|z
me018|is that a wireless?|z
me018|or|z
me011|no.|z
me018|oh.|z
me051|it's wired.|z
me013|oh!|z
fe008|is that does that mean you can't hear anything during the meeting?|z
me001|it's old school.|z
me011|huh what huh?|z
me013|should we uh close the door maybe?|z
me011|it it's a fairly good mike actually.|z
me013|so it's|z
me013|yeah.|z
me013|huh|z
me011|well i shouldn't say it's a good mike.|z
me011|all i really know is that the signal level is okay.|z
me011|i don't know if it's a|z
me011|the quality.|z
me013|well that's a|z
me011|ugh!|fe
me011|so i didn't send out agenda items.|t
me011|because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item.|s
me011|and now we have two.|s
me011|so and uh|fh
me013|okay.|bk
me013|so just to repeat the thing that we said last week|t
me013|it was there's this suggestion of alternating weeks on more uh automatic speech recognition related or not.|bu
me011|right.|aa
me013|was that sort of the division?|rt
me013|so which week are we in?|qw
me011|well we haven't really started.|s
me011|but i thought we more we more or less did meeting recorder stuff last week.|df
me011|so i thought we could do uh|cs
me013|i thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too.|arp
me011|but i figure also if they're short agenda items we could also do a little bit of each.|cs
me018|yeah.|aa
me013|yeah.|aa
me011|so|fh
me011|i seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted.|t3
me011|here we go.|t3
me013|okay.|bk
me011|so uh as most of you should know i did send out the consent form thingies.|s
me011|and uh|fh
me011|so far no one has made any ach any comments on them.|s
me011|so no no one has bleeped out anything.|s
me013|um yeah|fg
me011|so|fh
me011|i don't expect anyone to.|s
me011|but.|fh
me013|so what follows|qw
me013|at some point you go around and get people to sign something?|bu
me011|no.|ar
me011|we had spoken about this before.|s
me011|and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once.|s
me013|yeah but i've forgotten.|aa
me011|and the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity.|s
me011|so as long as we do that we're covered.|s
me013|and how long of an opportunity did you tell them?|rt
me011|uh july fifteenth.|s
me013|july fifteenth.|bk
me013|oh so they have plenty of time.|bk
me011|yep.|aa
me013|and|%--
me013|given that it's that long|s
me013|um um|fh
me013|why was that date chosen?|rt
me013|you just felt you wanted to|bu
me011|jane told me july fifteenth.|rt
me011|so that's what i set it.|s
me013|oh okay.|bk
fe008|oh i just meant that that was the release date that you had on the data.|bd
me011|oh i i didn't understand that there was something specific.|bk
fe008|i uh|%--
fe008|i thought|%--
me011|you you had|%--
me013|i don't|%--
me011|i had heard july fifteenth.|df
me011|so that's what i put.|s
me013|no the only the only mention i recall about that was just that july fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts.|ar
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|so|fh
fe008|that's right.|aa
fe008|that's why.|na
me013|oh i see.|bk
fe008|you said you wanted it to be available then.|s
me013|okay.|bk
me013|right.|bk
fe008|i didn't mean it to be the hard deadline.|bd
fe008|it's fine with me if it is.|s
fe008|or we|cs
fe008|but i thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that.|s
fe008|in case uh you know by the way this is your last|s
me013|right.|bk
fe008|uh yeah|fh
me013|we probably should have talked about it.|cs
me013|because because if we want to be able to give it to people july fifteenth|df
me013|if somebody's going to come back and say okay i don't want this and this and this used uh clearly we need some time to respond to that.|bu
me013|right?|d
me011|yeah as i said we i just got one date.|aa
mn017|damn!|fe
me013|yeah.|bk
me011|and that's the one i used.|s
me011|so but i can send a follow up.|cs
me013|yeah.|b
me011|i mean it's almost all us.|df
me011|i mean the people who are in the this meeting was uh these the meetings that in are in set one.|s
me018|was my was my response okay?|rt
fe008|that's right.|aa
me018|i just wrote you replied to the email saying they're all fine.|s
me011|right i mean that's fine.|bk
me018|okay good.|bk
me011|i we don't my understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that uh we don't actually need a reply.|s
me018|that makes it easy.|ba
me011|we just need to tell them that they can do it if they want.|e
me013|okay.|b
me013|i just didn't remember.|df
me013|but|fh
me011|and so no reply is no changes.|s
fe008|and he's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is okay.|s
me013|okay.|b
fe008|so that's very clear.|s
fe008|all the way down the page okay.|s
fe008|and they have two options.|s
fe008|they can change it to one of them is censor and the other one is incorrect.|s
fe008|is it is your word is incorrect?|qh
me011|right.|b
fe008|which means also we get feedback on if um there's something that they that needs to be adjusted.|s
fe008|because i mean these are very highly technical things.|df
fe008|i mean it's an added uh level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription as i see it.|s
fe008|but in any case people can agree to things that are wrong.|s
me011|well|fg
fe008|so|fh
me011|yeah the reason i did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly.|fg
fe008|and the reason i liked it was because|s
me011|as opposed to uh|s
fe008|was because it um it gives them the option of uh being able to correct it.|s
me011|right.|bk
fe008|approve it and correct it.|s
fe008|and um|fh
fe008|so you have it nicely set up so they email you.|s
fe008|and uh|%--
me011|when they submit the form it gets processed and emailed to me.|aap
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|fg
me011|so|fh
fe008|and i wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are robustness and meeting recorder.|rt
fe008|the german ones will be ready for next week.|s
fe008|those are three three of those.|s
fe008|a different set of people.|s
fe008|and we can impose|cs
me018|the german ones?|bu
fe008|uh well|%--
mn017|yeah those uh|aa
me013|n s a.|s
fe008|okay i spoke loosely.|bk
fe008|the the german french sorry the german dutch and spanish ones.|s
fe016|spanish|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|uhhuh.|b
me018|oh those are the n s a meetings?|bu
mn017|those are|%--
fe016|the non native|s
fe008|yeah uhhuh.|aa
me018|oh oh okay.|bk
me013|german dutch swiss and spanish.|s
fe016|the all non native|r
fe008|that's that's that's|%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me018|okay i'd i|bk
fe008|yeah it's the other group.|bk
me013|it was the network network services group.|s
me018|okay.|bk
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah exactly yeah.|aa
fe008|i didn't mean to isolate them.|bd
me013|otherwise known as the german dutch and spanish.|j
fe008|yeah sorry.|bk
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|it was it was not the best characterization.|ba
fe008|but what what i meant to say was that it's the other group that's not no no overlap with our present members.|s
fe008|and then maybe it'd be good to set an explicit deadline.|s
fe008|something like a week before that.|s
fe008|uh july fifteenth date.|s
fe008|or two weeks before.|s
me013|i mean i would suggest we discuss|cs
me013|i mean if we're going to have a policy on it|df
me013|that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people.|cs
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|so that we have a uniform thing.|df
me013|so that's a month.|s
me013|which is fine.|ba
me018|twelve hours.|s
me011|well the only thing i said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth.|s
me013|i mean it seems|%--
me011|i didn't give any other deadline.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|bk
me011|so my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says wow i suddenly found something we'll delete it from our record.|s
me011|we just won't delete it from whatever's already been released.|s
fe008|huh that's a little bit difficult.|ba
me011|what else can we do?|qo
fe008|yeah.|bk
me011|if someone says hey look i found something in this meeting and it's libelous and i want it removed what can we do?|qo
me011|we have to remove it.|df
fe008|well that's true.|aa
fe008|i i agree with that part.|aap
fe008|but i think that it would it uh we need to have uh a a a message to them very clearly that beyond this date you can't make additional changes.|cs
me013|i mean|s
me013|um|fh
me013|i i i i think that somebody might request something.|s
me013|even though we say that.|rt
me013|but i think it's good to at least start some place like that.|df
me013|so if we agreed okay how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have?|qw
fe008|uhhuh good.|b
me013|if we say two weeks or if we say a month|s
me013|i think we should just say that|cs
me013|say that you know as um per the the the uh page you signed you have the ability to look over this stuff and so forth.|cs
me013|and uh because we these uh|s
me013|i would i would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say because we uh will continually be making these things available to other researchers uh this can't be open ended.|cs
me013|and so uh uh please give us back your response within this you know within this amount of time whatever time we agree upon.|cs
me011|well did you read the email and look at the pages i sent?|rt
me013|did i?|rt
me013|no i haven't yet.|s
me011|no okay well why don't you do that?|bk
me013|no just|%--
me011|and then make comments on what you want me to change.|cs
me013|no no i'm not saying that you should change anything.|ar
me013|i'm what i'm what i'm i'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it.|s
me013|so that that you can you can uh decide on something.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i'm not telling you what to decide.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|i'm just saying you should decide something.|df
me011|i already did decide something.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me013|and then|%--
me011|and that's what's in the email.|s
fe008|yeah yeah okay so|fg
me011|and if you disagree with it why don't you read it and give me comments on it?|cs
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|well|fg
fe008|i i think that there's one missing line.|s
me013|well the one thing that i did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of july fifteenth.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|and you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you.|s
me011|right.|aa
me013|so what i'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough.|cs
me013|and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere.|cs
me013|that's all i'm saying.|bd
me011|okay.|bk
me013|okay.|bk
fe008|i i have one question.|s
fe008|this is in the summer period.|s
fe008|and presumably people may be out of town.|s
fe008|but we can make the assumption can't we that um they will be receiving email uh most of the month.|bu
fe008|right?|d
fe008|because if someone|df
me013|it well it well you're right sometimes somebody will be away.|s
me013|and uh you know there's uh for any length of time that you uh choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it.|s
fe008|okay.|bk
me013|that's it's you know just a certain risk to take.|s
mn017|so maybe when|s
mn017|am i on by the way?|rt
me011|i don't know.|no
mn017|oh.|bk
me011|you should be.|am
mn017|hello hello?|qh
me011|you should be channel b.|s
mn017|oh okay all right so the|bk
mn017|um|fh
mn017|maybe we should say in|cs
mn017|you know when the whole thing starts when they sign the agreement that|cs
mn017|you know specify exactly uh what you know how how they will be contacted.|cs
mn017|and they can you know they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address or both.|s
mn017|and um then|%--
fe008|we did that i i believe.|na
mn017|right.|bk
mn017|so and then you know say very clearly that if they don't if we don't hear from them you know as morgan suggested by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement.|fg
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|well they've already signed a form.|s
mn017|right.|bk
fe008|and the form says|s
fe016|and nobody nobody really reads it anyway.|s
me011|so|fh
me011|and the and the form was approved by human subjects.|df
mn017|says that.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|well if that's if that's already if|s
fe008|uh the|%--
me011|so uh that's going to be a little hard to modify.|ba
fe008|well the form well the form doesn't say if uh you know if you don't respond by x number of days or x number of weeks|s
mn017|i see.|bk
mn017|uh|fh
mn017|oh okay.|bk
mn017|so what does it say about the the the process of of uh the review process?|qw
fe008|it doesn't have a time limit.|s
fe008|that you'll be provided access to the transcripts.|rt
mn017|oh okay.|bk
fe008|and then uh allowed to remove things that you'd like to remove before it goes to the general uh larger audience.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|oh.|bk
me011|here.|s
me011|you can read what you already signed.|s
fe008|there you go.|s
fe016|i guess when i read it um|s
mn017|okay.|bk
fe016|i'm not as diligent as chuck.|s
fe016|but i had the feeling i should probably respond.|s
fe016|and tell adam like i got this and i will do it by this date.|s
fe016|and if you don't hear from me by then you know in other words responding to your email once right away saying as soon as you get this could you please respond.|cs
me011|right.|bk
fe016|and then if you if the person thinks they'll need more time because they're out of town or whatever they can tell you at that point.|cs
fe016|because|%--
me011|oh i just i didn't want to do that.|nd
me011|because i don't want to have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it.|df
fe016|well it's|%--
me011|so what i wanted to do was just send it out.|cs
me011|and say on the fifteenth the data is released.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|if you want to do something about it do something about it.|s
me011|but that's it.|s
fe008|i i kind of like this.|ba
fe016|well|%--
fe016|okay so we're assuming that|bk
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|well that's that would be great if|s
mn017|but you should probably have a legal person look at this.|cs
mn017|and make sure it's okay.|e
mn017|because if you if you uh do this and you then there's a dispute later and uh some you know someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have uh you know enough opportunity to actually exercise their their right|df
fe016|or they they might never have gotten the email.|s
fe016|because although they signed this they don't know by which date to expect your email.|df
fe016|and so someone whose machine is down or whatever|s
fe016|i mean we have no|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|internally we know that people are there.|s
me011|well okay let me let me reverse this.|bk
fe016|but we have no confirmation that they got the mail.|s
me011|so let's say someone i send this out.|s
me011|and someone doesn't respond.|rt
me011|do we delete every meeting that they were in?|rt
me011|i don't think so.|s
fe016|well then|%--
mn017|no.|ar
fe016|it we're hoping that doesn't happen.|s
fe016|but that's why there's such a thing as registered mail.|s
me011|that will happen.|s
fe016|or|%--
mn017|that will happen.|m
me011|that will absolutely happen.|r
fe016|right.|b
me011|because people don't read their email.|df
me011|or they'll read and say i don't care about that.|s
me011|i'm not going to delete anything.|s
me011|and they just won't reply to it.|s
mn017|maybe uh do we have mailing addresses for these people?|rt
me011|no.|ar
mn017|no.|bk
me011|we have what they put on the speaker form.|s
mn017|oh.|bk
me011|which was just generic contact information.|s
fe008|most|%--
fe008|but the ones that we're dealing with now are all local.|s
mn017|well then|%--
fe008|except the ones who|s
fe008|i mean we we're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|okay.|bk
fe008|so maybe uh i you know that's not that many people.|ba
fe008|and if i if uh|%--
fe008|there is an advantage to having them admit.|s
fe008|and if i can help with with processing that i will.|s
fe008|it's it's there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating|df
me011|yeah i mean i thought we had discussed this like a year ago.|fg
fe008|yes we did.|na
me011|and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again.|s
fe008|you're right.|na
fe008|well i you know but sometimes|s
me013|well we we haven't experienced it before.|s
me011|so|fh
fe008|that's right.|aa
me013|right?|d
me013|so|fh
fe016|you'll either wonder at the beginning or you'll wonder at the end.|s
fe008|need to get it right.|s
fe016|i mean there's no way to get around|s
fe016|it's pretty much the same amount of work.|s
fe016|except for an additional email just saying they got the email.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|and maybe it's better legally to wonder before|am
fe016|you know a little bit earlier than|s
me011|well|fg
fe008|it's much easier to explain this way.|s
me011|okay well why don't you talk|fg
fe008|to have it on record.|s
me011|morgan can you talk to our lawyer about it?|rt
me011|and find out what the status is on this.|e
me011|because i don't want to do something that we don't need to.|df
fe008|yeah but huh|fg
me011|because|%--
me011|what i'm telling you people won't respond to the email.|s
me011|no matter what you do there're going to be people who you're going to have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with.|s
me001|i mean it's|%--
mn017|huh.|b
fe008|well then we make the effort.|s
me011|and do we want to spend that effort?|qh
me001|it's kind of like signing up for a mailing list.|s
fe008|we make the effort.|r
me001|they have opt in and opt out.|s
me001|and there are two different ways.|s
me001|i mean and either way works.|s
me001|probably i mean.|bd
fe008|except i really think in this case|arp
fe008|i i'm i agree with liz that we need to be in the clear.|s
fe008|and not have to after the fact say oh but i assumed|s
fe008|and oh i'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you.|s
me013|if this is a purely administrative task we can actually have administration do it.|cs
fe008|you know.|f
fe008|oh excellent.|ba
me013|but the thing is that you know i i i think without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers from my previous conversations with them my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this.|s
fe008|yes.|b
me011|well we had talked about this before.|s
me011|and i thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|and they said you have to they've already signed away the with that form.|s
me011|that they've already signed once.|s
fe008|i don't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered.|no
me011|yeah.|b
me011|okay.|bk
me013|yeah we never really talked about that.|aa
fe016|or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you.|2
me013|yeah.|aa
fe008|or or how they would indicate|2
fe016|they probably forgot all about it.|s
me013|we certainly didn't talk uh about with them at all about uh the manner of them being made the uh uh materials available.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|we do it like with these|s
me013|that was something that was sort of just within our implementation.|s
mn017|we can use it we can use a a ploy.|cs
me011|okay.|b
mn017|like they use to um|s
mn017|you know that when they serve like|s
mn017|uh uh uh uh|fh
mn017|you know like dead beat dads.|s
mn017|they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery.|s
mn017|and then they open the envelope.|s
mn017|and that|%--
me001|and they're served.|2
mn017|right?|d
mn017|because and then the the the the thing is served.|rt
mn017|so you just make it you know oh you won.|s
mn017|you know go to this web site.|s
mn017|and you've uh you're|%--
fe016|that's why you never open these things that come in the mail.|j
fe008|that one.|j
me013|yeah.|b
me011|well it's just we've gone from one extreme to the other where at one point a few months ago morgan was you were saying let's not do anything.|s
mn017|right no i it might|fg
fe008|well it doesn't matter.|ba
mn017|it it might well be the case|s
me011|and now we're|s
mn017|it might|%--
me011|we're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature.|bu
mn017|right.|b
me011|i mean what are we going to doing here?|qw
mn017|it might well be the case that that this is perfectly you know this is enough to give us a basis to just uh assume their consent if they don't reply.|s
me013|well|%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|but i'm not you know me not being a lawyer i wouldn't just want to do that without having the the expert uh opinion on that.|df
fe008|and how many people|qw
me011|then i think we had better find out.|cs
fe008|altogether we've got twenty people these people are people who read their email almost all the time.|s
me011|so that we can find a|df
mn017|yeah.|aa
me013|let me look at this again.|cc
me011|right.|aa
fe008|i i really don't see that it's a problem.|ba
fe008|i i think that it's a common courtesy to ask them uh to expect for them to uh be able to have us try to contact them.|cs
me011|for for|%--
fe008|just in case they hadn't gotten their email.|s
fe008|i think they'd appreciate it.|s
me013|yeah my adam my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation.|fg
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|of of how my my|%--
me013|the things that we're questioning were along the lines of how easy|qh
me013|uh|fh
me013|how how much implication would there be that it's likely you're going to be changing something as opposed to|qh
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|that was the kind of dispute i was making before.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|i remember that.|bk
me013|but um the attorneys i uh i can guarantee you the attorneys will always come back with|s
me013|and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things.|s
me013|but they will always come back with saying that um you need to you want to have some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have uh in fact okay'd it.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|so um|fh
me013|i think that if you if we send the email as you have.|cs
me013|and if there's half the people say who don't respond at all by you know some period of time we can just make a list of these people.|cs
me013|and hand it to uh|s
me013|you know just give it to me.|s
me013|and i'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|and they'll just call them up and say you know have you|s
me013|is is this okay and would you please mail you know mail adam that it is if if it you know is or not.|cs
me013|so you know we can we can do that.|s
fe016|the other thing that there's a psychological effect that at least for most people that if they've responded to your email saying yes i will do it or yes i got your email they're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and of course we don't want them to bleep things out.|s
fe016|but it it's a little bit better if we're getting the their uh final response once they've answered you once than if they never answer you'd at at all.|s
fe016|that's how these mailing houses work.|s
fe016|so i mean it's not completely lost work.|s
fe016|because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|you know an official okay from somebody is better than no answer even if they responded that they got your email.|s
fe016|and they're probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email.|s
fe008|i also think they'd just simply appreciate it.|s
fe008|i think it's a good a good way of of fostering goodwill among our subjects.|e
fe008|well our participants.|bsc
me013|i think the main thing is i mean what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases.|s
me011|sending lots of spam.|s
me013|so they so so that's what they're paid to do.|s
me011|yep.|aa
me013|and so it is certainly possible that uh somebody's server would be down or something.|s
me013|and they wouldn't actually hear from us.|s
me013|and then they find this thing is in there.|s
me013|and we've already distributed it to someone.|s
me013|so what it says in there in fact is that they will be given an opportunity to blah blah blah.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason um then we haven't given them that.|s
me011|well so how far do we have to go?|fg
me011|do we need to get someone's signature?|rt
me011|or is email enough?|qrr
me011|do we have to have it notarized?|j
me013|email is enough.|na
me011|i mean|fh
me011|okay.|bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|i mean i've been through this|df
me013|i mean i'm not a lawyer.|bd
me013|but i've been through these things a things like this a few times with lawyers now.|df
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i i i'm pretty comfortable with that.|df
me018|do you track um when people log in?|tc
me018|to look at the|e
me011|uh if they submit the form i get it.|h
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|if they don't submit the form it goes in the general web log.|s
me011|but that's not sufficient.|s
me018|huh|b
me011|right?|d
me011|because if someone just visits the web site that doesn't imply anything in particular.|df
me018|except that you know they got the mail.|2
fe008|uhhuh that's right.|aa
me011|right.|aa
fe008|i i could get you on the notify list if you want me to.|cs
me011|i'm already on it.|ng
fe008|for that directory?|bu
me011|uhhuh.|aa
fe008|okay great.|bk
me013|so again hopefully um this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way.|s
me013|uh in any of the extremes we've talked about.|s
me013|because uh we're talking a pretty small number of people.|df
me011|for this set i'm not worried.|s
me011|because we basically know everyone on it.|df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|huh|%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|you know they're all more or less here.|s
me011|or it's it's eric and dan and so on.|s
me011|but for some of the others you're talking about visitors who are gone from icsi whose email addresses may or may not work.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|oh.|b
me011|and|fh
me011|so what are we going to do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with?|qw
fe008|i don't think uh they're so recent these visitors.|s
fe008|i and and i they're also so|%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|they're prominent enough that they're easy to find through|s
fe008|i i mean i i i'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them i really think i could find them.|s
me011|other methods?|2
me011|okay.|bk
me013|yeah because it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission.|fg
me013|um and i think you know if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they're not there it doesn't seem that|s
me013|that's the intent of uh meaning here.|s
me013|so|fh
me011|well the the question is just whether how active it has to be.|s
me011|i mean because they they filled out a contact information.|s
me011|and that's where i'm sending the information.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|and so far everyone has done email.|s
me011|there isn't anyone who did uh any other contact method.|s
me013|well the way icsi goes people uh who uh were here ten years ago still have have forwards to other accounts and so on.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me013|so it's unusual that that they uh|%--
me011|so my original impression was that that was sufficient.|s
me011|that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that we fulfilled our burden.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|then they just come back.|2
me018|all my files were still here.|s
fe016|same as us.|s
fe008|i just|%--
me013|so if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it.|s
me018|yeah.|bk
me011|okay.|bk
me013|but you know hopefully we won't need to.|s
fe008|i i just don't think we will.|s
me011|all right.|bk
fe008|for all the reasons that we've discussed.|s
me013|so we'll we'll see if we do or not.|s
me011|yep and we'll see how many people respond to that email.|fg
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|so far two people have.|s
me013|yeah i think very few people will.|fg
me011|so|fh
me013|and and and you know people people see long emails about things that they don't think is going to be high priority they typically uh don't don't read it or half read it.|s
me011|right.|aa
me013|because people are swamped.|df
me013|but|fh
fe008|and actually|s
fe008|um i i didn't anticipate this.|fh
fe008|so i that's why i didn't give this comment.|df
fe008|and it i this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow up email within the next couple of days saying by the way you know we want to hear back from you by x date.|cs
fe008|and please|cs
fe008|and then add what liz said.|cs
fe008|please uh respond to please indicate you received this mail.|s
me013|uh or well maybe even additionally uh um|s
me013|even if you've decided you have no changes you'd like to make if you could tell us that.|cs
me011|respond to the email yep.|2
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right that would that would definitely work on me.|aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|it is the first time through the cycle.|s
fe016|you know it makes you feel like|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|if you were going to if you're predicting that you might not answer you have a chance now to say that.|s
fe016|whereas i i mean i would be much more likely myself|s
me018|and the other|%--
fe016|given all my email to respond at that point saying you know what i'm probably not going to get to it or whatever.|s
fe016|rather than just having seen the email thinking i might get to it.|s
fe016|and never really uh pushing myself to actually do it until it's too late.|s
me018|yeah i was|%--
me018|i was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this.|s
fe016|right right that's true.|aa
me013|right.|aa
me018|i mean i i|s
me018|yeah.|fh
me018|so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say i got it no changes they're off the hook.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|they don't have to go to the web page.|s
me018|and|fh
me013|i mean the other thing i've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth uh is um if you say you've got three months to do this review um people do it you know two and seven eighths months from now.|s
fe016|yeah that's true.|aa
me011|right.|b
me013|if you say you've got three weeks to do this review they do do it you know two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review.|s
me013|and um so|fh
me013|if we make it a little less time i don't think it'll be that much|cs
me011|well and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth that means we better give them deadline of the first.|fg
me011|if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time.|s
me013|there's the responding part.|na
me013|and there's also what if|qh
me013|uh i mean i hope this doesn't happen.|bd
me013|what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes?|qh
me011|right.|b
me013|then we actually have to deal with that.|s
fe008|uhhuh some lead time.|na
me013|if we want it to|%--
me011|ugh!|fe
me011|disk space.|s
me011|oh my god!|fe
fe008|by the way has has jeremy signed the form?|rt
me011|i hadn't thought about that.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me011|that for every meeting|s
me011|any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of.|s
mn017|oh.|bk
me018|just that channel?|bu
me001|can't you just do that channel?|rt
me018|oh no we have to do|ar
me011|no of course not.|ar
me011|you need all the channels.|e
fe016|yeah you have to do all of them.|aa
me001|oh.|bk
me018|do you have to do the other close talking?|rt
fe016|as well as all of these.|e
me001|yeah.|bk
me051|wow.|bk
me011|yes absolutely there's a lot of cross talk.|aa
fe016|you have to do all you could just do it in that time period though.|cs
fe008|well|fg
fe016|but i guess it's a pain.|bd
me011|well but you have to copy the whole file.|ng
fe016|yeah.|bk
me011|right?|d
me011|because we're going to be releasing the whole file.|df
fe016|yeah you're right.|aa
fe008|well i you know i think at a certain point that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy.|s
me011|yeah it's just i hate deleting any data.|am
me011|so i i don't want i really would rather make a copy of it rather than bleep it out.|s
me013|are you are you bleeping it by adding?|rt
me011|and then|%--
me011|overlapping.|s
me011|so it's it's exactly a censor bleep.|fh
me011|so what i really think is bleep|cs
me013|i understand.|bk
me011|and then i want to|cs
me013|but is is it summing signals?|rt
me013|or do you delete the old one and put the new one in?|qrr
me011|i delete the old one put the new one in.|s
me013|oh okay.|bk
me011|there's nothing left of the original signal.|s
me013|because|%--
me013|oh because if you were summing you could|fg
me013|no but anyway|ar
me011|yeah it would be quite easy to get it back again.|aa
fe008|and then i was going to say also that they don't have to stay on the system as you know.|cs
me013|yeah.|bk
fe016|then someday we can sell the unedited versions.|cs
fe008|because because the the ones|df
me011|say again?|br
fe008|once it's been successfully bleeped can't you rely on the|qy
me018|or we'll tell people the frequency of the beep.|cs
me013|encrypt it.|cs
me001|you can hide it yeah.|cs
me018|and then they could subtract the beep out.|cs
mn017|oh yeah.|aa
fe008|can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version?|r
fe016|right exactly i see.|aa
me001|it wouldn't be that hard to hide it.|ba
me011|yeah that's true yeah yep that's true.|aa
fe016|see this is good.|ba
fe016|i wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings.|rt
me013|yeah you could encrypt it.|fg
fe008|okay.|bk
me001|you can use spread spectrum.|cs
me013|you know with a with a two hundred bit thousand bit uh|cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so|fh
me001|hide it.|cs
me018|here we go.|s
fe016|yeah yeah.|aa
me001|yeah there you go.|j
fe016|because we don't have enough asides.|ba
mn017|i have an idea.|s
mn017|you reverse the signal.|cs
mn017|so it it lets people say what they said backwards.|s
me001|there you go.|s
me011|backwards.|s
me001|then you have like subliminal uh messages.|s
me011|but|%--
me011|you've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments?|qy
mn017|yeah.|b
me001|like|%--
me011|did you read that paper?|rt
mn017|no.|ar
me011|it wouldn't work.|s
me011|the speech recognizer still works.|s
fe016|yeah and if you do it backward then|aa
me013|yeah.|b
me018|that's because they use forward backward.|s
fe016|h good old h m m.|ba
me011|forward but backward that's right.|bk
fe016|no it's backward forward.|ar
me011|good point.|ba
me011|a point.|aap
me011|uh well i'm sorry if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing.|fg
me011|it's just we've had meeting after meeting after meeting on this.|df
me011|and it seems like we've never gotten it resolved.|s
me013|well but we never also we've also never done it.|s
fe008|huh.|b
fe016|uh|%--
me011|so|fh
me011|yeah.|aa
fe008|this is the first cycle.|s
fe016|if it makes|%--
fe008|there're bound to be some glitches the first time through.|s
me013|and uh and i'm sorry responding without uh having much knowledge.|fa
me013|but the thing is uh i am like one of these people who gets a gazillion mails.|df
me013|and and stuff comes in as|s
me011|well and that's exactly why i did it the way i did it.|df
me011|which is the default is if you do nothing we're going to release it.|s
me011|because you know i have my stack of emails of to to be done.|rt
me013|yeah.|b
me011|that you know fifty or sixty long.|rt
me011|and the ones at the top i'm never going to get to.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|and uh so so|fg
me018|move them to the bottom.|cs
me011|yeah right.|aa
me013|so so the only thing we're missing is is some way to respond to easily to say uh okay go ahead or something.|s
me011|so this is going to mean|qy
me018|just re mail them to yourself and then they're at the bottom.|cs
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yeah.|aa
me011|yeah that's actually definitely a good point.|fg
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|the email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email as as opposed to going to the form.|s
mn017|in|%--
fe008|uhhuh.|rt
fe016|right.|aa
me011|and|%--
fe008|and it also doesn't give a a specific i didn't think of it.|s
fe008|i think it's a good idea an explicit time by which this will be considered definite.|cs
me011|yeah release.|fg
fe008|and and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint.|co
me013|yeah it's converging.|bk
mn017|this um i've seen this recently.|s
fe008|yeah that's right.|aa
mn017|uh i got email.|s
mn017|and it if i use a mime capable mail reader it actually says you know click on this button to confirm receipt of the of the mail.|rt
me001|huh.|b
fe008|oh that's interesting.|ba
mn017|so|fh
me011|you you can|%--
me011|a lot of mailers support return receipt.|bd
me001|it's like certified mail.|s
fe008|could do that.|cs
mn017|right.|aa
me011|but it doesn't confirm that they've read it.|bd
mn017|no no no this is different.|ar
mn017|this is not so i i know you can tell you know the uh mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox.|s
fe008|huh.|b
me011|right.|b
mn017|but but no this was different.|s
mn017|in the mail there was a|s
me011|oh just a button.|2
mn017|uh there was a button that when you clicked on it it would send uh you know a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail.|s
me011|oh yeah.|b
me011|yeah yeah we could do that.|bk
me011|but i hate that.|ba
mn017|but it but it only works for you know mime capable.|s
mn017|you know if you use netscape or something like that for your|s
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|you might as well just respond to the mail.|cs
me013|and|%--
me013|and we actually need a third thing.|s
mn017|right.|aa
fe016|i mean|%--
me013|it's not that you've looked at it.|s
me013|it's that you've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions.|s
mn017|no no you can do that.|ar
me013|right?|d
mn017|you know you can put this button anywhere you want.|s
me013|oh?|bh
mn017|and you can put it the bottom of the message and say here by you know by clicking on this i i agree uh you know i acknowledge|s
me013|oh i see.|bk
me013|that my first born children are yours.|2
me013|and|fh
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|quick question.|tc
fe016|are um|qy
me011|well i could put a u r l in there without any difficulty.|cs
me011|and even pretty simple mime readers can do that.|s
fe008|but why shouldn't they just email back?|qh
me011|so|fh
me011|yeah reply.|fg
me013|yeah.|bk
fe008|i don't see there's a problem.|ba
mn017|right.|b
fe008|it's very nice.|ba
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|i i like the high-tech aspect of it.|s
mn017|no no no i actually don't.|ar
fe008|but i think|s
fe008|i appreciate it.|ba
mn017|i'm just saying that.|s
me011|well i because i use a text mail reader.|s
mn017|if but i'm|s
fe016|don't you use v i?|rt
fe016|for your|e
mn017|yeah.|aa
me013|wow that's that's my guy.|ba
me013|all right.|bk
me011|you you read email in v i?|bu
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|so i|%--
fe008|i like v i.|ba
mn017|there's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page like powered by v i.|s
me001|yeah.|b
me013|wow!|fe
fe016|anyway quick question.|r
me011|you could put wed bugs in the email.|cs
me001|i see.|bk
fe016|how|qw
mn017|yeah.|bk
fe016|like there were three meetings this time or|s
fe016|or how many?|qw
fe008|six.|s
fe016|six.|bk
fe016|but of different people.|s
fe016|so i guess if you're in both these types of meetings you'd have a lot.|ba
fe016|but how|qw
fe016|i mean it also depends on how many|s
fe016|like if we release this time it's a fairly small number of meetings.|ba
fe016|but what if we release like twenty five meetings to people?|cs
me011|well what my expectation is is that we'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready.|s
fe016|in|%--
fe016|i don't know.|bd
fe016|oh oh okay.|bk
me011|so that was my intention.|s
fe016|so this time was just the first chunk okay.|s
me011|it's just|s
me011|yeah.|aa
me011|that we just happened to have a bunch all at once.|df
fe016|well that's a good idea.|ba
me011|i mean maybe|s
me011|is that the way it's going to be you think jane?|rt
fe008|i agree with you.|s
fe008|it's we could do it uh i could i'd be happy with either way.|s
fe008|batch wise|s
fe008|what i was thinking|s
fe008|uh so this one|s
fe008|that was exactly right.|s
fe008|that we had a uh uh|s
fe008|i i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready.|rt
fe008|don't have it.|s
fe008|but uh this was the biggest clump i could do by a time where i thought it was reasonable.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|people would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.|s
fe008|my um i was thinking that with the n s a meetings i'd like there are three of them.|s
fe008|and they're uh i i will have them done by monday.|s
fe008|uh unfortunately the time is later.|bd
fe008|and i don't know how that's going to work out.|bd
fe008|but i thought it'd be good to have that released as a clump too.|cs
fe008|because then you know they're they they have a it's in a category.|bu
fe008|it's not quite so distracting to them is what i was thinking.|s
fe008|and it's all in one|s
fe008|but after that when we're caught up a bit on this process then um i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available.|s
fe016|okay.|bk
fe008|i could do it either way.|cs
fe008|i mean it's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking.|s
me013|we heard anything from i b m?|bu
me013|at all.|e
me018|uh let's see.|h
me018|we|%--
me018|yeah right.|bk
me018|so we got the transcript back from that one meeting.|s
me018|everything seemed fine.|ba
me018|adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was well there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix.|s
me018|and then um we uh i sent him a pointer to three more.|s
me018|and so he's off and working on those.|s
me011|yeah now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting to see whether the transcript is correct.|fg
me011|and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff.|s
fe008|that's on my list.|na
me011|so at some point we need to do that.|cs
me018|yeah.|b
fe008|well that's on my list.|r
me018|yeah it's going to have to go through our regular process.|fg
me011|i mean the one thing i noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels.|s
me011|there are a fair number of yeahs and uhhuh that it's just that aren't in there.|s
me011|so|fh
fe008|huh.|b
me013|but i think yeah like you said i mean that's that's going to be our standard|s
me013|that's what the transcribers are going to be spending most of their time doing i would imagine.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me013|once once we|%--
me011|yes absolutely yeah.|bk
fe008|one question about the backchannels.|s
me013|it's going to|s
fe008|do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre segmenter?|rt
me011|yes absolutely absolutely.|aa
fe008|oh interesting.|ba
fe008|oh interesting okay.|ba
me011|yeah they're they're not in the segmented.|fg
me011|it's not that the i b m people didn't do it.|s
fe008|okay.|bk
fe008|okay.|bk
me011|just they didn't get marked.|s
fe008|okay so maybe when the detector for that gets better or something|bk
fe008|i i|%--
fe008|there's another issue which is this|s
fe008|we've been uh contacted by university of washington now of course to um|s
fe008|we sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings.|rt
fe008|and they're downloading the audio files.|s
fe008|so they'll be doing that.|s
fe008|chuck's chuck's uh put that in.|s
me018|uhhuh yeah i pointed them to the set that andreas put uh on the web.|aa
me018|so if they want to compare directly with his results they can.|s
me018|and um then once uh|s
me018|we can also point them at the um uh the original meetings.|s
me018|and they can grab those too with s c p.|s
fe016|wait so you put the reference files|bu
me018|no no they they wanted the audio.|ar
fe016|or the|qrr
me018|jane sent them the uh transcripts.|s
fe016|no i mean of the transcripts.|ar
fe016|um|fh
fe016|well we can talk about it off line.|cs
me011|there's another meeting in here what at four?|rt
me018|uhhuh.|aa
me011|right?|d
me011|yeah so we have to finish by three forty five.|co
mn017|so does does does u w want to do this want to use this data for recognition or for something else?|qr
me018|uh for recognition.|s
mn017|oh.|bk
fe016|i think they're doing|s
fe016|didn't they want to do language modeling on you know recognition compatible transcripts?|bu
mn017|oh i see.|bk
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|or|qrr
fe008|this is to show you uh some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure.|s
fe008|so this is from one of the n s a meetings.|s
fe008|and uh if you're familiar with the diff format the arrow to the left is what it was.|s
fe008|and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to.|s
fe008|so|fh
fe008|and now the first one.|s
fe008|okay so then we started a weekly meeting.|s
fe008|the last time uh and the transcriber thought little too much.|ba
fe008|but uh|fh
fe008|really um it was we learned too much.|s
fe008|which makes more sense syntactically as well.|ba
mn017|and these the parentheses were from|bu
fe008|then|%--
fe008|oh this that's the convention for indicating uncertain.|bk
me011|uncertains.|s
fe008|so the transcriber was right.|s
fe008|you know she was uncertain about that.|s
mn017|okay.|bk
fe008|so she's right to be uncertain.|s
mn017|oh okay.|b
fe008|and it's also a a good indication of the of that.|s
fe008|the next one this was about uh claudia.|s
fe008|and she'd been really busy with stuff such as waivers.|s
fe008|uh okay.|bk
fe008|um next one.|s
fe008|um this was an interesting one.|s
fe008|so the original was so that's not so claudia's not the bad master here.|s
fe008|and then he laughs.|s
me011|web master.|s
fe008|but it really web master.|s
me001|oh uhoh.|bk
fe008|and then you see another type of uncertainty which is you know they just didn't know what to make out of that.|s
fe008|so instead of split upon unknown it's split in principle.|s
me011|yep.|b
me001|jane these are from i b m?|bu
me011|spit upon?|bu
me001|the top lines.|e
fe008|no no these are these are our local transcriptions of the n s a meetings.|ar
me011|no these are ours.|ar
me001|oh.|bk
fe008|the transcribers transcriber's version versus the checked version.|e
me001|oh i see.|bk
fe008|my my checked version after i go through it.|e
me001|okay.|bk
fe008|um then you get down here.|s
fe008|um|fh
fe008|sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms.|s
fe008|that's the next example.|s
fe008|the next one.|s
fe008|the uh version beyond this is|s
fe008|so instead of saying or|s
fe008|especially those words also and oder and some other ones.|s
fe008|those sneak in.|s
fe008|um the next one|s
mn017|discourse markers.|s
me011|that's cool.|ba
mn017|discourse markers.|r
fe008|sorry what?|fa
fe008|discourse markers?|bu
mn017|discourse markers.|r
fe008|sure sure sure sure.|aa
mn017|yeah yeah.|aa
fe008|and it's and it makes sense.|ba
fe008|because it's like below this it's a little subliminal there.|df
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah yeah.|aa
fe008|um okay the next one.|fg
fe008|uh this is a term.|rt
fe008|the problem with terminology.|s
fe008|description with the transcriber has x as an advance.|s
fe008|but really it's q s in advance.|s
fe008|i mean i i've benefited from some of these uh cross group meetings.|s
fe008|okay then you got|fg
fe008|um uh|fh
fe008|instead of from something or other cards it's for multicast.|s
fe008|and instead of ann system related it's end system related.|s
fe008|this was changed to an acronym initially.|s
fe008|and it shouldn't have been.|s
fe008|and then you can see here g p s was misinterpreted.|s
fe008|it's just totally|by
fe008|this is this is a lot of jargon.|s
fe008|um and the final one|s
fe008|the transcriber had in the core network itself|s
fe008|or the exit unknown.|s
fe008|not the internet unknown.|s
fe008|and it it comes through as in the core network itself of the access provider.|s
fe008|not the internet backbone core.|s
fe008|now this is a lot of terminology.|ba
mn017|huh.|aa
fe008|and they're generally extremely good|ba
fe008|but you know in this this area it really does pay to um to double check.|s
fe008|and i'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you'll see substantial improvements in performance.|s
fe008|because the you know there're a lot of these in there.|s
mn017|yeah so how often|fg
me011|yeah but i bet i bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway though.|fg
me001|huh.|b
fe008|no actually no.|ar
me011|oh really?|bh
fe008|huh uh.|aa
me011|uh it's|%--
me011|oh so it's just jargon.|bk
fe008|it's jargon yeah.|bk
fe008|i mean this is because you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top down influences in what you're hearing.|df
mn017|well but|%--
mn017|but but|%--
fe008|and it's it's jargon coupled with a foreign accent.|s
mn017|but we don't i mean our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow.|s
mn017|so|fh
mn017|you know until you actually get a decent language model adam's right.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|it probably won't do any better.|2
mn017|you probably won't notice a difference.|s
mn017|but it's i mean it's definitely good that these are fixed.|ba
mn017|i mean obviously.|bd
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|well also from the standpoint of getting people's approval.|s
fe008|because if someone sees a page full of uh um barely decipherable you know sentences and then is asked to approve of it or not it's uh uh|s
me011|did i say that?|rt
me013|yeah.|aa
me013|yeah that would be a shame if people said well i don't approve it because the it's not what i said.|fg
fe008|okay.|b
me011|well that's exactly why i put the extra option in|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|exactly that's why we discussed that.|aa
me011|is that i was afraid people would say let's censor that because it's wrong.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and i don't want them to do that.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|and then i also the final thing i have for transcription is that i made a purchase of some other headphones.|s
fe008|because of the problem of low gain in the originals.|df
fe008|and and they very much they much prefer the new ones.|s
fe008|and actually i i mean i i think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice.|s
fe008|we'd originally chosen uh very expensive headsets.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me011|ugh!|fe
fe008|but um they're just not as good as these um in this with this respect to this particular task.|ba
mn017|well return the old ones.|s
me011|it's probably impedance matching problems.|s
me011|but|fh
fe008|i don't know exactly.|s
fe008|but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription.|df
me013|could be.|am
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|so it we had every reason to think they would work.|s
mn017|so you have spare headsets?|bu
fe008|sorry what?|fa
mn017|you have spare headsets?|bu
me011|they're just earphones.|ng
me011|they're not headsets.|e
me011|they're not microphones.|e
mn017|no no i mean just earphones.|ar
fe016|right.|b
mn017|um|fh
mn017|because i uh i could use one on my workstation.|df
mn017|just to|%--
mn017|because sometimes i have to listen to audio files.|df
mn017|and i don't have to go borrow it from someone.|s
mn017|and|fh
fe008|we have actually i have|s
fe008|well the thing is that if we have four people come to work for a day i was i was hanging on to the others for uh for spares.|s
mn017|oh okay.|bk
mn017|sure no problem.|bk
me013|no but you'd if you yeah we should get it.|cs
fe008|but i can tell you what i recommend.|cs
me011|but if you need it just get it.|s
mn017|i just|%--
me011|come on.|s
mn017|right.|bk
me013|yeah if you need it.|e
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me001|yeah i still i still need to get a pair too.|fg
fe008|it'd just have to be a a separate order an added order.|s
me013|they're they're they're they're pretty inexpensive.|ba
fe016|yeah that|%--
fe016|we should order a uh two or three or four actually.|cs
me001|i'm using one of these.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me001|yeah.|b
mn017|i think i have a pair that i brought from home.|s
fe016|we have|%--
mn017|but it's just for music listening.|s
me013|no just just just just buy them.|co
mn017|and it's not|s
fe016|just get the model number.|cs
mn017|nnn yeah.|b
fe016|and|%--
me013|just buy them.|co
fe016|where do you buy these from?|rt
mn017|yeah.|b
fe008|cambridge soundworks just down the street.|s
fe016|like|%--
fe016|you just go and|s
fe016|oh.|bk
fe008|yeah they always have them in stock.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|anyway.|tc
fe016|that'd be a good idea.|ba
me011|uh could you email out the brand?|rt
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|oh sure yeah okay.|aa
me011|because i think sounds like people are interested.|df
me001|yeah.|aa
me011|so|fh
me001|definitely.|aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|it's made a difference in in how easy|ba
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|i realized something i should talk about.|t
me013|so what's the other thing on the agenda actually?|t
me011|uh the only one was don wanted to uh talk about disk space yet again.|s
me001|yeah.|aa
me001|it's short.|ba
me001|i mean if you want to go we can just throw it in at the end.|s
me013|no no why don't you why don't you go ahead?|ar
me013|since it's short.|df
me001|um well uh|h
me011|oh i thought you meant the disk space.|s
mn017|the disk space was short.|s
me011|yeah we know disk space is short.|aa
mn017|yeah that's what i thought too.|aa
fe016|that's a great ambiguity.|ba
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|it's one of these|s
fe016|it's it's social.|s
me013|it's|%--
fe016|and uh discourse level.|e
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|and|fh
me013|yeah it's great.|fg
fe016|sorry.|fa
me013|yeah.|b
me013|double double|%--
me011|yeah it was really|fg
fe016|see if i had that little scratch pad i would have made an x there.|s
me001|thank you thank you.|ft
me011|uh well we'll give you one then.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me001|um so um|fg
me001|without thinking about it when i offered up my hard drive last week|s
me011|oh no!|by
fe016|it was while i was out of town.|s
me001|um this is always a suspect phrase.|s
me001|but um no i uh i realized that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments um for this uh paper we're writing.|fg
me001|so we're probably going to need a lot more.|s
me001|we're probably going to need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive.|s
me001|but um we also have someone else coming in that's going to help us out with some stuff.|df
me001|so|fh
me013|we've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.|df
fe016|i think we need like another eighteen gig disk to be safe.|cs
me001|okay we just need to|bk
me013|well we're getting three thirty thirty sixes.|s
fe016|so|%--
me001|okay.|bk
me013|right?|d
me013|that are going into the main file server.|e
fe016|okay.|bk
me018|markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon.|s
me001|well so so|fg
me013|so|fh
me011|soon?|m
me001|yeah i mean i guess the thing is is all i need is to hang it off like the person who's coming in sonali's computer.|fg
mn017|oh so so you mean the the internal the disks on the machines that we just got?|bk
me001|whew!|fe
me001|or we can move them.|cs
me011|no.|ar
mn017|or extra disk?|qrr
me018|these are going to go onto abbott.|s
me011|new disks.|s
me013|onto abbott.|s
me001|so are we going to move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in?|rt
me013|the file server.|s
mn017|oh oh okay.|bk
me011|on|%--
me011|yeah.|aa
me011|once they come in sure.|s
fe016|uh|%--
me001|okay that's fine.|bk
fe016|do when when is this planned for roughly?|qw
me018|they should be i i imagine next week or something.|rt
fe016|okay.|bk
me001|okay.|bk
me011|if you're if you're desperate i have some space on my drive.|cs
fe016|so|fg
me001|i think if i'm|s
me011|but i i vacillate between no space free and a few gig free.|s
fe016|yeah.|bk
me001|yeah i think i can find something if i'm desperate.|fg
me011|so|fh
me001|and um in the meantime i'll just hold out.|s
me011|okay.|bk
me001|that was the only thing i wanted to bring up.|s
me018|it should be soon.|s
me018|we we should|s
me001|okay.|bk
me013|so there's another hundred gig.|s
me013|so|fh
me001|all right great.|ba
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay.|bk
me001|that's it.|tc
me013|it's great to be able to do it.|ba
fe016|good.|b
me013|just say oh yeah a hundred gig.|s
me001|yeah.|b
me011|yeah.|b
me013|no big deal.|s
me011|a hundred gig here.|s
me011|a hundred gig there.|s
fe016|well each meeting is like a gig or something.|s
me011|it's eventually real disk space.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so it's really|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|um yeah i was just going to comment that i'm going to uh be on the phone with mari tomorrow late afternoon.|fg
me011|oh yeah.|b
me013|we're supposed to get together and talk about uh where we are on things.|s
me013|uh there's this meeting coming up.|rt
me013|uh and there's also an annual report now.|s
me013|i never actually|s
me013|i i was asking about this.|s
me013|i don't really quite understand this.|s
me013|she was she was referring to it as|s
me013|i think this actually didn't just come from her.|s
me013|but this is what uh darpa had asked for.|s
me013|um she's referring to it as the annual report for the fiscal year.|s
me013|but of course the fiscal year starts in october.|s
me013|so i don't quite understand why we do an annual report that we're writing in july.|s
me018|she's either really late or really early.|ba
me011|huh.|b
me011|or she's getting a good early start.|2
me013|uh i think basically it's none of those.|s
me013|it's that the meeting is in july.|s
me013|so they so darpa just said do an annual report.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|so anyway i'll be putting together stuff.|fh
me013|i'll do it uh you know as much as i can without bothering people.|s
me013|just by looking at at papers and status reports.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|i mean the status reports you do are very helpful.|ba
me013|uh so i can grab stuff there.|s
me013|and if uh if i have some questions i'll|s
me011|when we remember to fill them out.|2
me013|yeah if people could do it as soon as as you can if you haven't done one recently.|aa
me013|uh uh|fh
me013|but you know i'm i'm sure before it's all done i'll end up bugging people for for more clarification about stuff.|s
me013|um but um|fh
me013|i don't know.|bd
me013|i guess i guess i know pretty much what people have been doing.|rt
me013|we have these meetings and and there's the status reports.|s
me013|uh but um um|fh
me013|yeah so that wasn't a long one just to tell you that and if something hasn't uh|fg
me013|i'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon.|s
me013|and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it's important thing to mention on this kind of thing uh uh just pop me a one liner.|s
me013|and and and i'll i'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation.|s
mn017|okay.|bk
me013|uh.|fh
me013|i guess uh you're still pecking away at the demos and all that probably.|t
me011|yep.|aa
me011|and don is going to be helping out with that.|s
me013|oh that's right.|bk
me011|so|fh
me013|okay.|bk
me011|did you want to talk about that this afternoon?|rt
me001|um|fh
me011|not here but later today.|e
me001|we should probably talk off line about when we're going to talk off line.|cs
me011|okay okay.|bk
me013|okay.|bk
me013|yeah i might want to get updated about it in about a week.|fg
me013|because um i'm actually going to have a a few days off the following week.|df
me013|after the after the picnic.|e
me013|so|fh
me011|oh okay.|bk
me013|that's all i had.|t
me011|so we were going to do sort of status of speech transcription.|s
me011|automatic transcription.|bsc
me011|but we're kind of running late.|s
me011|so|fh
fe016|how long does it take you to save the data?|qw
me011|fifteen minutes.|s
fe016|yeah.|bk
me011|so|fh
me011|if you want to do a quick|s
fe016|yeah.|aa
me011|ten minute.|s
fe016|guess we should stop like twenty of at the latest.|cs
me013|uh|%--
fe016|we we have another meeting coming in that they want to record.|s
fe016|so|fh
me013|and there's the digits to do.|2
me013|so maybe maybe maybe|s
me011|yeah well we can skip the digits.|bk
me013|we could.|am
me013|five minute report or something.|cs
fe016|it's up to you.|rt
fe016|i don't|s
me011|whatever you want.|s
me013|yeah yeah.|aa
me013|well i would love to hear about it.|na
me011|what do you have to say?|qw
me011|i'm interested.|na
me013|especially since|df
me011|so|fh
me013|yeah well i'm going to be on the phone tomorrow.|fg
me013|so this is just a good example of the sort of thing i'd like to hear about.|ba
fe016|wait why is everybody looking at me?|rt
me011|sorry.|fa
me018|i don't know.|no
me013|because he looked at you.|s
mn017|what?|qw
me013|and says you're sketching.|s
fe016|uh i'm not sure what you were referring to.|h
mn017|i i i i'm not actually i'm not sure what|no
mn017|are we supposed to have done something?|rt
me011|no we were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting.|ar
mn017|oh.|bk
mn017|alternating.|bk
fe016|uhhuh.|bk
me011|and this week we were going to try to do automatic transcription status.|s
fe016|i wasn't here last week.|df
mn017|oh!|bk
fe016|sorry.|fa
fe016|oh.|bk
mn017|we did that last week.|bu
me011|but we sort of failed.|s
mn017|right?|d
fe016|hhh.|b
me011|no.|ar
me013|i thought we did.|am
me011|did we?|rt
mn017|yeah we did.|aa
me011|okay.|bk
me011|okay so now now we have the schedule.|bk
me011|so next week we'll do automatic transcription status.|cc
me011|plus anything that's real timely.|s
mn017|okay.|bk
fe016|oh .okay.|bk
fe008|okay.|bk
me013|okay whew!|bk
me011|whew!|ba
me018|good update.|ba
me013|that was|%--
me011|dodged that bullet.|j
me013|yeah nicely done liz.|ba
fe008|a woman of few words.|s
me013|but but lots of prosody.|2
me013|okay okay.|bk
mn017|uh i mean we we really haven't done anything.|s
me011|excuse me?|br
mn017|sorry.|fa
fe008|well since last week.|2
fe016|yeah we're|fg
mn017|i mean the the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the um the automatic alignments.|s
mn017|because uh i got some|s
mn017|i i i learned from thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech.|s
