fe016|we're i mean we we didn't have a house before.|z
me013|yeah.|z
me013|yeah.|z
mn005|okay.|z
me013|we're on again?|z
me013|okay.|z
me018|uhhuh.|z
me018|that is really great.|z
me011|yeah so if uh so if anyone hasn't signed the consent form please do so.|z
fe016|oh yeah!|z
me018|that's terrific.|z
me011|the new consent form.|z
me011|the new and improved consent form.|z
me018|now you won't be able to walk or ride your bike huh?|z
fe008|uh.|z
me013|okay.|z
me013|okay.|z
fe016|right.|z
me011|and uh shall i go ahead and do some digits?|qy^rt
me013|uh we were going to do that at the end.|h|s^ng
me013|remember?|qy^d^rt
me011|okay whatever you want.|s^bk|s
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|just just to be consistent from here on in at least that that we'll do it at the end.|s^co^df
fe016|the new consent form.|s.%
me011|it's uh yeah it doesn't matter.|s^bd
me011|okay.|s^aa
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe008|testing one two three.|z
me013|um well it i mean it might be that someone here has to go.|fh|s
me013|and|%--
me013|right?|qy^d^g.%
me013|that was that was sort of the point.|s
me013|so uh i had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda to send it to me and no one did.|fh|s^t^tc
me013|so|fh
me011|so we all forgot.|s
me013|uh|fh
fe008|from last time i wanted to uh the an uh one topic from last time.|s
me013|right.|s^bk
me013|okay so one item for an agenda is uh jane has some uh uh some research to talk about research issues.|s^t
me013|um and uh adam has some short research issues.|fh|s^bs
me011|and i have some short research issues.|s
me013|um i have a list of things that i think were done over the last three months.|s
me013|i was supposed to send off uh and um i i sent a note about it to uh to adam and jane.|s
me013|but i think i'll just run through it also and see if someone thinks it's inaccurate or uh insufficient.|s^cc
me018|a list that you have to send off to who?|qy^d^rt
me013|uh to uh uh i b m.|h|s
me018|oh.|s^bk
me013|okay.|b
me013|they're you know|s.%--
me013|so|fh
me013|um so uh so i'll go through that.|fh|s^cc
me013|um and anything else anyone wants to talk about?|fh|qo^d^rt
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|okay.|fh
me018|what about the um your trip yesterday?|qw^rt^tc
me013|um.|h
me013|sort of off topic i guess.|s
me013|because that's because that was all all about the uh|s.%--
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|i i i can chat with you about that off line.|s^cc
me013|that's another thing.|s
me013|um and anything else?|fh|qo^d^rt
me013|nothing else?|qo^d
me013|uh there's a i mean there is a a um uh telephone call tomorrow which will be a conference call that some of us are involved in for uh a possible proposal.|fh|s^tc
me013|um we'll talk we'll talk about it next week if if something|s^co.%-
me011|do you want me to be there for that?|qy^rt
me011|i noticed you c c'ed me but i wasn't actually a recipient.|s
me011|i didn't quite know what to make of that.|s
me013|uh well we'll talk talk about that after our meeting.|h|s^co
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay.|b
me013|uh okay.|fg
me013|so it sounds like the the three main things that we have to talk about are uh this list uh jane and jane and adam have some research items and other than that anything as usual anything goes beyond that.|s^bs^t^tc
me013|okay uh jane since since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours?|s^bk|qh^co^t
me013|make sure we get to it.|s^df
fe008|okay it's it's very uh it's very brief i mean just let me just hand these out.|s^cc
fe008|oops!|s^fe
me011|is this the same as the e mail or different?|qr
fe008|it's slightly different.|s
mn014|thanks.|s^ft
fe008|i basically the same.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me018|same idea?|qy^2^d^rt
fe008|but same idea.|s^aa
fe008|so if you've looked at this you've seen it before.|s
fe008|so basically um as you know uh part of the encoding includes a mark that indicates an overlap.|s
fe008|it's not indicated with um uh tight precision it's just indicated that okay so it's indicated to to so the people know what parts of which which stretches of speech were in the clear versus being overlapped by others.|s
fe008|so i used this mark and um and uh uh divided the|s.%--
fe008|i wrote a script which divides things into individual minutes of which we ended up with forty five and a little bit.|s
fe008|and uh you know minute zero of course is the first minute up to sixty seconds.|s
mn014|okay.|b
fe008|and um what you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right whether they involve two speakers three speakers or more than three speakers.|s
fe008|and um and what i was looking for specifically was the question of whether they're distributed evenly throughout or whether they're bursts of them.|fh|s
fe008|um.|fh
fe008|and it looked to me as though|s.%--
fe008|uh you know this is just uh uh this would this is not statistically verified but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout rather than being localized to a particular region.|s
fe008|the part down there where there's the maximum number of of um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to to to code stress uh sentence stress as possible indication of uh information retrieval.|s
fe008|so it's like you know rather lively discussion there.|s
me013|what was what's the the parenthesized stuff that says like the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight?|qw
fe008|oh.|s^bk
fe008|that's the per cent.|s
me013|huh.|b
fe008|so six is uh two point eight per cent of the total number of overlaps in the session.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh.|b
mn014|uhhuh.|b
fe008|at the very end this is when people were you know packing up to go basically.|s
fe008|there's this final stuff.|s^e
fe008|i think we i don't remember where the digits fell.|s^no
fe008|i'd have to look at that.|s
fe008|but the final three there are no overlaps at all.|s
fe008|and couple times there are not.|s
fe008|so it seems like it goes through bursts but um that's kind of it.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
fe008|now another question is is there are there individual differences in whether you're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others.|s
fe008|and again i want to emphasize this is just one particular um one particular meeting and also there's been no statistical testing of it all but i um i took the coding of the|s.%--
fe008|i you know my i had this script figure out um who was the first speaker who was the second speaker involved in a two person overlap i didn't look at the ones involving three or more.|s
fe008|and um this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with who who else.|s
fe008|and if you look at the marginal totals which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom you get the totals for an individual.|s
fe008|so um if you look at the bottom those are the um numbers of overlaps in which um adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look|s.%--
fe008|i'm sorry but you're alphabetical that's why i'm choosing you.|s^fa
fe008|and then if you look across the right then that's where he was the person who was the first speaker in the pair and got overlap overlapped with by somebody.|s
me018|huh!|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and then if you look down in the summary table then you see that um they're differences in whether a person got overlapped with or overlapped by.|s
me011|is this uh just raw counts or is it|qr.%-
fe008|raw counts.|s
me011|so it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe008|yes very true very true.|s^aa
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|normalized to how much|s^t1.%-
fe008|it would be good to normalize with respect to that.|s^na
fe008|now on the table i did take one step toward uh away from the raw frequencies by putting uh percentages.|s
fe008|so that the percentage of time of the of the times that a person spoke what percentage uh|s.%--
fe008|so of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two person overlap what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they the overlappee?|qw
fe008|and there it looks like you see some differences.|s
fe008|um that some people tend to be overlapped with more often than they're overlapped.|s
fe008|but of course uh this is just one meeting uh there's no statistical testing involved and that would be required for a for a finding of any kind of scientific reliability.|s
me013|so it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that adam talked too much or something.|s^j
me011|no no actually that would be actually statistically correct.|s^ar|s^nd
fe008|no no no.|fg
me013|yeah yeah.|s^aa.%
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me011|but|%--
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
fe008|yeah that's right.|s^aa
fe008|that's right.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|and i'm you know i'm i don't see a point of singling people out.|s
me013|excuse me.|s^t3
fe008|now this is a case where obviously|s.%-
me013|i i i rather enjoyed it but but this|s.%-
me018|but the numbers speak for themselves.|s
mn005|he's yeah yeah yeah.|s^t3
me011|yes that's right so you don't okay.|s^aa|s
fe008|well you know it's like i'm not i'm not saying on the tape who did better or worse.|s
fe008|because i don't think that it's|s^df.%--
me013|sure.|b
fe008|i you know|%--
fe008|and and here's a case where of course human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results and and so might as well do this.|s|s^cs
me011|yeah when this is what this is actually when jane sent this e mail first is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|well fair enough.|s^bk
fe008|fair enough.|s^bk^r
fe008|and actually you know the point is not about an individual it's the point about tendencies toward you know different styles different speaker styles.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
me013|oh sure.|b
fe008|and it would be you know of course there's also the question of what type of overlap was this and what were they.|s
fe008|and and i and i know that i can distinguish at least three types and probably more.|s
fe008|i mean the general cultural idea which uh the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish before you start talking.|s
fe008|and and you know i mean we know that and they've loosened up on that too in the intervening time that that that's that's viewed as being a culturally relative thing.|s
fe008|i mean that you have the high involvement style from the east coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying.|s^e
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and|s.%--
fe008|yeah exactly!|s^fe
fe016|exactly!|s^fe.%
fe008|well there you go.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|fine that's all right that's okay.|s^j
fe008|and and you know in contrast so deborah and also deborah tannen's thesis.|s
fe008|she talked about differences of these types that they're just different styles.|s
fe008|and it's um you you can't impose a model of there of the ideal being no overlaps.|s
fe008|and you know conversational analysts also agree with that.|s
fe008|so it's now universally agreed with.|s^e
fe008|and and|s.%--
fe008|i mean i can't say universally.|s^bd
fe008|but anyway the people who used to say it was strict um now uh don't.|s
fe008|i mean they they also you know uh uh acknowledge the influence of of subcultural norms and cross cultural norms and things.|s
fe008|so um then it though so just just superficially to give um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved i have at the bottom several that i noticed.|s
fe008|so uh there are backchannels like what adam just did now.|s
fe008|and um um anticipating the end of a question and simply answering it earlier.|fh|s
fe008|and there are several of those in this in these data where|s.%--
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe008|because we're people who've talked to each other.|s^df^rt
fe008|um we know basically what the topic is what the possibilities are and and we've spoken with each other.|s^df^e
fe008|so we know basically what the other person's style is likely to be.|s
fe008|and so and there are a number of places where someone just answered early.|s
fe008|no problem.|s
fe008|and places also which i thought were interesting where two or more people gave exactly the same answer in unison different words of course.|s
fe008|but you know the basically you know everyone's saying yes or you know or even more specific than that.|s
fe008|so uh the point is that um overlap's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved.|s
fe008|and that's all i wanted to say on that unless people have questions.|s
me013|well of course the biggest um result here which is one we've we've talked about many times and isn't new to us but which i think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps.|s
me011|yep.|b
mn005|yes yes!|s^fe
fe008|oh okay interesting.|s^bk|s^ba
me013|that that right that that um|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|here's a relatively short meeting.|s
me013|it's a forty forty plus minute meeting.|s
me013|and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps but uh i think there's one one minute there where there where where there wasn't any overlap.|s^rt
me011|hundred ninety seven.|s^t3
me013|i mean it's uh throughout this thing.|s^rt
fe008|well at the bottom you have the bottom three.|s
me013|it's you have|s.%-
me011|are|%-
me018|it'd be interesting|s.%-
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|so four four minutes all together with none none.|s
me013|oh so the bottom three did have stuff going on?|qy^bu^d
me018|but it|s.%-
fe008|yes uhhuh.|s^aa
me013|there was speech.|s^bs
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|but just no overlaps.|s
me013|okay so if the this|s.%-
me018|it'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps versus|s^cs.%-
fe008|yes exactly and that's that's where jose's project comes in.|s^aa|s
mn017|i was about to ask|s.%-
mn005|yeah yeah i i have that i have that information now.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|fh.%
fe016|huh.|b
me013|oh about how much is it?|qw^rt
mn005|the the duration of uh of each of the overlaps.|s
me013|oh what's what's the what's the average length?|qw^rt
mn005|i i haven't averaged it now.|s^cc
mn005|but uh i i will uh i will do the the study of the with the with the program with the uh the different uh the nnn distribution of the duration of the overlaps.|s^cc
me013|you don't know?|qy^d
me013|okay you you you don't have a feeling for roughly how much it is?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn005|huh because the the uh budget is horrid.|s^ng
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|the duration is uh the variation the variation of the duration is uh very big on the|s^na.%--
me013|yeah.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe008|i suspect that it will also differ depending on the type of overlap involved.|s
mn005|but uh|%-
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|so backchannels will be very brief.|s
me013|oh i'm sure.|s^aa
mn005|because on your surface uh a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration uh overlapped and another very very short.|s^na
fe008|and|%-
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|uh probably it's very difficult to to because the the overlap is uh is only the in the final s of the of the the the the end the end word of the um previous speaker with the the next word of the the new speaker.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn005|um i considered that's an overlap but it's very short it's an x with a and the idea is probably uh when uh when uh we studied that zone uh uh we we have uh uh confusion with uh uh noise.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn005|with uh that fricative sounds but uh i have new information but i have to to study.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah but i i'd|fg|s.%--
mn017|can i|%-
me013|go ahead.|s^cs.%
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|you split this by minute um so if an overlap straddles the boundary between two minutes that counts towards both of those minutes.|s
fe008|yes.|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|actually um um actually not.|s^ar
fe008|uh so let's think about the case where a starts speaking and then b overlaps with a and then the minute boundary happens.|s^cs
fe008|and let's say that after that minute boundary um b is still speaking and a overlaps with b.|s
fe008|that would be a new overlap.|s
fe008|but otherwise um let's say b comes to the conclusion of of that turn without anyone overlapping with him or her.|s
fe008|in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute.|s
mn017|no but suppose they both talk simultaneously both a a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|in that case um my the coding that i was using since we haven't uh incorporated adam's uh coding of overlap yets the coding of|s.%--
fe008|yeah yets is not a word.|s^t1
fe008|uh since we haven't incorporated adam's method of handling overlaps yet um then that would have fallen through the cracks.|s
fe008|it would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because um i i wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was encoded so far.|s
fe008|we just haven't done the precise second to you know second to second coding of when they occur.|s
me013|i'm i'm i'm confused now.|s
me013|so let me restate what i thought andreas was saying and and see.|s^cc
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|let's say that in in second fifty seven of one minute you start talking and i start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds.|s^cs
fe008|yep.|b
fe008|okay.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|so we go over so we were we were talking over one another and it's just in each case it's just sort of one interval.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|so um we talked over the minute boundary.|fh|s
me013|is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes the way you have done this?|qy
fe008|no it wouldn't.|s^ar
fe008|it would be considered as an overlap in the first one.|s^nd
me013|okay so that's good i think in the sense that i think andreas meant the question.|s
fe016|that's that's good yeah because the overall rate is|s^aa|s^na.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
mn014|hmph.|b
me011|statistical.|s
fe016|yeah.|fh
me011|yep.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn017|otherwise you'd get double counts here and there.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|they're not double counted.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|uh but yeah.|b
mn017|and then it would be harder.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|i should also say i did a simplifying uh count in that if a was speaking b overlapped with a and then a came back again and overlapped with b again.|s
fe008|i i didn't count that as a three person overlap i counted that as a two person overlap and it was a being overlapped with by d.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the the first person reasserted the floor kind of thing.|s
fe008|these are simplifying assumptions.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|didn't happen very often.|s
fe008|there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing.|s
me011|i want to go back and listen to minute forty one.|s^cc
fe008|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me011|because i find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two speaker.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|i mean what i thought what i would have thought in is that when there were a large number of overlaps it was because everyone was talking at once but uh apparently not.|s
fe008|that's interesting.|s^ba
fe008|that's interesting.|s^ba^r
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|huh.|b
me011|that's really neat.|s
fe008|yeah there's a lot of backchannel a lot a lot of|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
me011|this is really interesting data.|s
fe008|yeah it is.|s^aa
fe008|i think so too i think.|s^aa
fe016|i think what's really interesting though it is before saying yes meetings have a lot of overlaps is to actually find out how many more we have than two party.|s
fe016|because in two party conversations like switchboard there's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels if you consider those overlaps.|s^rt
fe016|it's also it's huge.|s
fe016|it's just that people haven't been looking at that because they've been doing single channel processing for speech recognition.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so the question is you know how many more overlaps do you have of say the two person type by adding more people to a meeting.|s
fe016|and it may be a lot more but it may it may not be.|s
me013|well but see i find it interesting even if it wasn't any more.|fg|s
fe016|so|fh
me013|because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice.|s^df
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|so that so the issue is in in a situation where that's|s.%-
fe016|well it's not really nice.|s^ar
fe016|it depends what you're doing.|s
fe016|so if you were actually having|s.%--
fe016|uh|fh
fe016|depends what you're doing.|s
fe016|if right now we're we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so the question is you know are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two person party.|s
me013|let let let me rephrase what i'm saying because i don't think i'm getting it across.|s^cc
fe016|and and there well may be but|s.%-
me013|what what i what i shouldn't use words like nice because maybe that's too too imprecise.|s
me013|but what i mean is that um in switchboard despite the many many other problems that we have one problem that we're not considering is overlap.|s
me013|and what we're doing now is aside from the many other differences in the task we are considering overlap.|s
me013|and one of the reasons that we're considering it you know one of them not all of them one of them is that uh at least you know i'm very interested in the scenario in which uh both people talking are pretty much equally audible and from a single microphone.|s
me013|and so in that case it does get mixed in and it's pretty hard to to just ignore it to just do processing on one and not on the other.|s
fe016|i i agree that it's an issue here but it's also an issue for switchboard.|s
fe016|and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone which i think you know this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have meetings over different phone lines.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so if each of us was calling and having a meeting that way you you know like a conference call.|s
fe016|and just the question is you know in switchboard you would think that's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and i'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that that jane described happen with more people present.|s
fe016|so it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be.|s
me013|that's an important question to ask.|s^ba
me013|i think what i'm all i'm really saying is that i don't think we were considering that in switchboard.|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|not you me.|s^arp
me013|were you|qy.%-
me011|though it wasn't in the design.|s
fe016|but uh but but|fg
me013|were you were you were you were you measuring it?|qy^rt
me013|i mean were|s.%-
fe016|there there's|s.%--
fe016|actually to tell you the truth the reason why it's hard to measure is because of|s^na.%--
fe016|so from the point of view of studying dialogue i mean which dan jurafsky and andreas and i had some projects on you want to know the sequence of turns.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so what happens is if you're talking and i have a backchannel in the middle of your turn and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it's we know that that's wrong in real time.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|but because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in switchboard were missing people couldn't study it.|s
fe016|but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way.|s
me013|yeah i wasn't saying that.|fg|s^ng
fe016|so it's um|fh|s.%-
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|i was just saying that now we're looking at it.|s
fe016|well we've|s.%--
me013|and and and you you maybe wanted to look at it before but for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't.|s
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|we're looking at it here.|s^na
me013|so that's why it's coming to us as new.|s
me013|even though it may well be you know if your if your the hypothesis you were offering uh|s.%--
fe016|um.|b
me013|right if it's the null hypothesis and if actually you have as much overlap in a two person we don't know the answer to that.|s
me013|the reason we don't know the answer to is because it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up right.|s
fe016|yeah all i meant is that if you're asking the question from the point of view of what's different about a meeting studying meetings of say more than two people versus what kinds of questions you could ask with a two person meeting.|fg|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|it's important to distinguish that you know this project is getting a lot of overlap but other projects were too but we just couldn't study them.|s
me013|may have been.|s^am
fe016|and and so uh|s.%--
me013|may have been.|s^am^r
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|we do we don't know the numbers.|s
fe016|well there is a high rate.|h|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|it's but i don't know how high in fact.|s^no
me018|well i have a question.|s
fe016|that would be interesting to know.|s
me013|see i mean let me|s.%--
me013|i mean my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody what have we learned about overlaps here.|s
me013|just never mind comparison with something else.|s^co
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|what we've learned about is overlaps in this situation is that the first the first order thing i would say is that there's a lot of them.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|in in the sense that if you said if|s.%--
fe016|yeah i i don't i agree with that.|s^aa
me013|in a way i guess what i'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how how much people overlap.|s
me013|uh you know the fact that when when when uh adam was looking for a stretch of of speech before that didn't have any overlaps and he he was having such a hard time.|fh|s
me013|and now i look at this and i go well i can see why he was having such a hard time.|s
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|that's also true of switchboard.|s
me013|it's happening a lot.|s
me013|i wasn't saying it wasn't.|s^df
fe016|it may not be|s.%--
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|so it's just um|s.%--
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|i was commenting about this.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|i'm saying if i i'm saying if i have this complicated thing in front of me and we which you know we're going to get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data.|s^df
fe016|all i'm saying is that from the|s.%-
me013|but then if i was going to describe to somebody what did you learn right here about you know the the modest amount of data that was analyzed i'd say well the first order thing was there was a lot of overlaps.|s
me013|in fact and it's not just an overlap bunch of overlaps second order thing is it's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point but that there's overlaps uh throughout the thing.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|and that's interesting.|s
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|no i i agree with that.|s^aa
me013|that's all.|s
fe016|i'm just saying that it may the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting.|s
me013|oh yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^aa^r
fe016|and that's all.|s
me013|yeah i wasn't making any statement about that.|s^df
fe016|and and it would actually be interesting to find out.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|because some of the data say switchboard which isn't exactly the same kind of context.|s
fe016|i mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth.|s
fe016|but we should still be able to somehow say what what is the added contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person or something like that.|s
me011|yep.|b
me011|i could certainly see it going either way.|s
me013|yeah that would be good to know.|fg|s
fe008|okay now.|fg
me018|what|%-
me013|but we|%-
fe008|yeah i i agree i agree with adam.|s^aa
fe016|but yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|and the reason is because i think there's a limit there's an upper bound on how many you can have simply from the standpoint of audibility.|s
fe008|when we speak we we do make a judgment of can you know as adults.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right.|b
fe008|i mean children don't adjust so well.|s
fe008|i mean if a truck goes rolling past adults will well depending but mostly adults will will will hold off to what to finish the end of the sentence till the till the noise is past.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and i think we generally do monitor things like that about whether we whether our utterance will be in the clear or not.|s
fe016|right.|b
fe008|and partly it's related to rhythmic structure in conversation.|s
fe008|so you know you you yeah this is also um people tend to time their their their um when they come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic uh uh ambient thing.|s
me018|well|fg
fe016|right.|b
fe008|so you don't want to be cross cutting.|s
fe008|and and just to finish this that um that i think that there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already in the fray.|s
fe008|but i you know of certain types.|s^e
fe008|now if it's just backchannels people may be doing that with less intention of being heard just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels.|s
fe008|in which case that those might there may be no upper bound on those.|s
mn017|i i have a feeling that backchannels which are the vast majority of overlaps in switchboard uh don't play as big a role here because it's very unnatural i think to backchannel if in a multi audience you know in a multi person audience.|s
fe016|if you can see them actually.|s
fe016|it's interesting.|s
fe016|so if you watch people are going like right right like this here.|s
mn017|right.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|but that may not be the case if you couldn't see them.|s^df
mn017|but but it's sort of odd if one person's speaking and everybody's listening.|s
mn017|and it's unusual to have everybody going uhhuh uhhuh.|s
me013|actually i think i've done it a fair number of times today.|s
me013|but.|fh
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|there's a lot of head nodding in this.|s
me011|um.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|yep we need to put trackers on it.|s^cs
me018|in in the two person|s.%-
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|b
fe008|he could he could.|s
mn017|plus plus plus the|s.%--
mn017|yeah.|fg
mn017|so so actually um that's in part because the nodding if you have visual contact the nodding has the same function.|s
mn017|but on the phone in switchboard you you that wouldn't work.|s
me011|yeah you don't have it.|s^na
mn017|so so you need to use the backchannel.|s
me011|your mike is|s^t3.%--
me018|so in the two person conversations when there's backchannel is there a great deal of overlap in the speech?|qy^r^rt
me011|that is an earphone so if you just put it so it's on your ear.|s^co^t3
me018|or|qrr.%--
me018|because my impression is sometimes it happens when there's a pause.|s
fe016|yes.|s^aa
me011|there you go.|s^t3
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|thank you.|s^ft^t3
fe008|for example.|s
me018|you know like you you get a lot of backchannel when somebody's pausing.|s
fe016|yes.|b
fe016|right.|b
fe008|she's doing that.|s
fe016|sorry what were you saying?|s^fa|qw^rt
me018|it's hard to do both.|s
me018|huh?|qy^d^g^j
me018|um no when when when there's backchannel i mean just i was just listening and and when there's two people talking and there's backchannel it seems like um the backchannel happens when you know the pitch drops and the first person|fh|s.%--
fe016|oh.|b
me018|and a lot of times the first person actually stops talking and then there's a backchannel and then they start up again.|s
me018|and so i'm wondering about i just wonder how much overlap there is.|s
me018|is there a lot?|qy^rt
fe016|i think there's a lot of the kind that jose was talking about where i mean this is called precision timing in conversation analysis where they come in overlapping but at a point where the information is mostly complete.|s^na
fe016|so all you're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words.|s
me018|huh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so technically it's an overlap.|s
fe016|but you know from information flow point of view it's not an overlap in the predictable information.|s
me018|but maybe a just a small overlap?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn005|more yeah.|b
me011|it'd be interesting if we could do prediction.|s^cs
me018|i was just thinking more in terms of alignment alignment overlap.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|language model prediction of overlap that would be really interesting.|s
mn017|so so|fg
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|well that's exactly exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps in uh switchboard.|s^na
mn017|right.|b
me011|right.|s^bk
mn017|so so here's a here's a first interesting labeling task.|s
fe016|say because there's a lot of that.|s
mn017|uh to distinguish between say backchannels precision timing sort of you know benevolent overlaps and and and and and sort of um i don't know hostile overlaps where someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else.|fh|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me011|let's pick a different word.|s^j^t3
mn005|yeah.|b
mn017|uh that that might be an interesting um problem to look at.|s^cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|hostile takeovers.|s^j
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|well i mean you could do that.|s^ng
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|i i i think that in this meeting i really had the feeling that wasn't happening that the hostile hostile type.|s^nd
fe008|these were these were benevolent types as people finishing each other's sentences and stuff.|s^nd
mn017|okay.|s^bk
fe016|uhhuh.|b
mn017|um i could imagine that as there's a fair number of um cases where and this is sort of not really hostile but sort of competitive where one person is finishing something and you have like two or three people jumping trying to trying to trying to uh grab the next turn.|fg|s^df^nd
me011|trying to get the floor.|s^2
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and so it's not against the person who talks first because actually we're all waiting for that person to finish.|s
mn017|but they all want to be next.|s
me013|i have a feeling most of these things are that that are not a benevolent kind are are are uh um are are competitive as opposed to really really hostile.|s^na
mn017|right.|s^aa
fe008|yeah i agree.|s^aa
me013|but.|fh
me018|i wonder what determines who gets the floor?|qw^d
fe008|i agree.|s^aa
fe008|well there are various things you you have the|s.%-
me018|i mean|s.%-
me013|uh a vote vote in florida.|fg|s^j
me011|it's been studied a lot.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|voting for|s.%-
me013|um one thing i i wanted to or you can tell a good joke and then everybody's laughing and you get a chance to break in.|fg|s
mn017|seniority.|s
me013|but.|fh
me013|but.|fh
me013|um.|fh
me013|you know the other thing i was thinking was that um these all these interesting questions are of course pretty hard to answer with uh you know a small amount of data.|s
me011|ach.|b
me013|so um i wonder if what you're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have um a a fair number of meetings with uh a smaller number of people.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|i mean we most of our meetings are uh meetings currently with say five six seven eight people.|s
me013|should we really try to have some two person meetings or some three person meetings and record them just to to to beef up the the statistics on that?|qy^cs
fe008|that's a control.|s^t3
fe008|well it seems like there are two possibilities there.|s
fe008|i mean it seems like if you have just two people it's not really like a meeting is not as similar as the rest of the of the sample.|s^ng
fe008|it depends on what you're after of course.|s^arp
fe008|but it seems like that would be more a case of the control condition compared to uh an experimental condition with more than two.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|well liz was raising the question of of whether it's the number there's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|and um if you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you'd still have the visuals.|fh|s
me013|you wouldn't have that difference also that you have in the say in switchboard data.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh.|fh
fe008|yeah i'm just thinking that'd be more like a control condition.|s^nd
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|well but from the acoustic point of view it's all good.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|is the same.|s^2^aa
me013|yeah acoustic is fine.|s^na
mn017|if if the goal were to just look at overlap you would you could serve yourself save yourself a lot of time but not even transcribe the words.|s
me013|but|%-
me011|yep.|b
fe016|well i was thinking you should be able to do this from the acoustics on the close talking mikes.|s
me011|well that's the that was my my status report.|s^na
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|you've been working on that.|s
fe016|right?|qy^d^g
fe016|right i mean adam was|s^aa|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|so once we're done with this stuff discussing.|s
fe016|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|i mean not as well as what i mean you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology obviously.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|but you'd get some rough statistics.|s
me013|but what what do you think about that?|fg|qo
fe016|so|fh
me013|do you think that would be useful?|qy
me013|i'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two person meetings or something.|s
fe016|i guess my my first comment was um only that um we should not attribute overlaps only to meetings.|s^co
fe016|but maybe that's obvious.|s
fe016|maybe everybody knew that.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|but that in normal conversation with two people there's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and that it would be interesting to look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that jane mentioned that what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn.|s
fe016|you know because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn.|s^df
fe016|but pretty quickly there're they back off.|s
fe016|and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time.|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so i don't know.|fh
fe016|to answer your question i it i don't think it's crucial to have controls.|s
fe016|but i think it's worth recording all the meetings we can.|s
me011|can.|s^2
me013|well okay.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|so um you know.|fh
mn017|i i have an idea.|s
fe016|i wouldn't not record a two person meeting just because it only has two people.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
mn017|could we could we um|qy.%--
mn017|we have have in the past and i think continue will continue to have a fair number of uh phone conference calls.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|yeah we talked about this repeatedly.|s
mn017|and uh and as a to um as another comparison condition we could um see what what what happens in terms of overlap when you don't have visual contact.|fh|s^cs
mn017|so um|fh
fe016|can we actually record?|qy^rt
me011|it just seems like that's a very different thing than what we're doing.|s^ng
me013|uh well we'll have to set up for it.|fh|s^ng
fe016|i mean physically can we record the the other|qy.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me013|well we're not really set up for it to do that.|s^ng
me013|but|fh
mn017|or this is getting a little extravagant we could put up some kind of blinds or something to to remove uh visual contact.|fg|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
me011|barriers!|s^fe^t3
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|that's what they did on map task you know this map task corpus.|s
fe016|they ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues.|s
fe016|and it's quite interesting.|s
me013|well we we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that i mean a little strange.|s
me011|okay we can record but no one can look at each other.|s^co^j
fe016|well we could just put blindfolds on.|fg|s^cs^j
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|close your eyes.|s^co^j
mn017|well no you|fg|%--
mn017|yeah yeah.|b
me011|turn off the lights.|s^co^j
fe016|and we'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds.|s^j
fe016|that would|s.%-
me013|oh that was the other thing.|fg|s
me013|weren't we going to take a picture at the beginning of each of these meetings?|qy^rt
me011|um what i had thought we were going to do is just take pictures of the whiteboards rather than take pictures of the meeting.|h|s^nd
fe008|well linguistic|s.%--
me011|and uh|fh
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|yes.|b
fe008|linguistic anthropologists would would suggest it would be useful to also take a picture of the meeting.|s^ng
me013|there's a head nodding here vigorously yeah.|s
me018|why why do we want to have a picture of the meeting?|qw^rt
fe008|the because you get then the spatial relationship of the speakers.|s
fe016|you mean no|s.%-
mn017|well you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the the seat number.|s^cs^ng
fe008|and that could be|s.%-
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|seat number that's a good idea.|s
me011|i'll do that.|s^cc
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|i'll do that on the next set of forms.|s^cc
mn017|so you'd number them somehow.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|is possible to get information from the rhythmic from the uh uh files.|s
me011|i finally remembered to put uh put native language on the newer forms.|s
me018|we can can't you figure it out from the mike number?|qy^rt
me011|no.|s^ar
me018|okay.|s^bk
me011|the wireless ones.|s
me011|and even the jacks i mean i'm sitting here and the jack is over in front of you.|s
me018|oh.|s^bk
fe016|but probably from these you could've infer it.|s^arp
mn017|yeah but it's it would be trivial|s^nd.%-
me011|it would be another task.|s^ng
fe016|it would be a research task.|s^df
me011|having having ground truth would be nice so seat number would be good.|s
me018|you know where you could get it?|qw^d^rt
fe016|yeah yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|beam forming during the digit uh stuff.|s
me011|so i'm going to put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number.|s^cc
mn014|uhhuh.|b
me011|that's a good idea.|s
mn017|not the chairs.|s^arp
fe016|but you have to keep the chairs in the same like here.|s^co
me011|but uh|fh
mn017|the chairs are chairs are movable.|s^ng
mn017|put them like put them on the table where they|s^cs.%-
mn005|the yeah.|b
me011|yep.|s^bk
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
fe008|but you know they the the linguistic anthropologists would say it would be good to have a digital picture anyway.|s^cs
me018|just remembered a joke.|s^t3
fe008|because you get a sense also of posture.|s^df
mn017|what people were wearing.|s^2
me011|yeah.|b
fe008|posture and we could like you know block out the person's face or whatever.|s^cs
fe016|the fashion statement.|s^j
fe008|but but you know these are important cues.|s
mn017|oh andreas was|s.%-
me018|how big their heads are.|s^j
fe008|i mean the the how a person is sitting is|s.%-
me013|but if you just|s.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|but from one picture i don't know that you really get that.|s
mn017|andreas was wearing that same old sweater again.|s^j
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|you'd want a video for that i think.|s^cs^t3
fe008|it'd be better than nothing is is just from a single picture i think you can tell some aspects.|s
mn005|a video yeah.|s^aa
me013|think so?|qy^d^rt
fe008|i mean i i could tell you i mean if if i'm in certain meetings i notice that there are certain people who really do uh the body language is very uh is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect.|s
mn017|and and|%
me013|huh.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|and and morgan had that funny hair again.|s^j
fe008|yeah well i mean you black out the that part.|s
me011|huh.|b
fe008|but it's just you know the the body.|s
me018|he agreed.|s
fe008|you know?|qy^d^g
me011|of course the where we sit at the table i find is very interesting that we do tend to to gravitate to the same place each time.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|and it's somewhat coincidental.|s
me011|i'm sitting here so that i can run into the room if the hardware starts you know catching fire or something.|s
mn017|oh no you you just like to be in charge that's why you're sitting|s^j.%--
me011|i just want to be at the head of the table.|s^j
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|take control.|s^j
me013|speaking of taking control you said you had some research to talk about.|s^t^tc
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|yeah i've been playing with um uh using the close talking mike to do to try to figure out who's speaking.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|so my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering that we talked about about two weeks ago.|s
me011|and so i played with that a little bit and it works okay except that it's very sensitive to your choice of your filter width and your threshold.|s
me011|so if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone's talking and when they're not.|s
me011|but if you try to use the same parameters on another speaker it doesn't work anymore.|s
me011|even if you normalize it based on the absolute loudness.|s
fe016|but does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting?|qy^rt
me011|it does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting.|s^na
me011|um pretty well.|fh|s^na
me011|pretty well.|s^na^r
me018|how did you do it adam?|qw^rt
me011|how did i do it?|qw^bu^rt
me011|what do you mean?|qw^bu
me018|yeah.|b
me018|i mean what was the|s.%-
me011|the algorithm was uh take every frame that's over the threshold and then median filter it and then look for runs.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|so there was a minimum run length.|s
me018|every frame that's over what threshold?|qw^d^rt
me011|so that|%-
me011|a threshold that you pick.|s
me018|in terms of energy?|qy^d^rt
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me018|uh.|fh
me018|okay.|b
fe008|say that again.|s^br
fe008|frame over threshold.|s
me011|so you take a each frame and you compute the energy.|s
me011|and if it's over the threshold you set it to one and if it's under the threshold you set it to zero so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones.|s
fe008|huh.|b
fe008|okay.|b
me011|and then i median filtered that using um a fairly long filter length.|s
me011|uh well actually i guess depends on what you mean by long you know tenth of a second sorts of numbers.|fh|s
me011|um and that's to average out you know pitch you know the pitch contours and things like that.|fh|s
me011|and then uh looked for long runs.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me011|and that works okay if you if you tune the filter parameters if you tune how long your median filter is and how high you're looking for your thresholds.|s
me018|did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold?|qy^rt
me011|no.|s^ar
me011|i certainly could though.|s
me011|but this was just i had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do.|s
me011|okay and then the other thing i did was i took javier's speaker change detector acoustic change detector and i implemented that with the close talking mikes.|s
me011|and unfortunately that's not working real well and it looks like it's|s.%--
me011|the problem is he does it in two passes.|s
me011|the first pass is to find candidate places to do a break.|s
me011|and he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the the uh one of the phone classes is silence.|s
me011|and so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends.|s
me011|and then he has a second pass which is a modeling a gaussian mixture model.|s
me011|um looking for uh whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places.|fh|s
me011|and what looks like it's happening is that the even on the close talking mike the broad phone class classifier's doing a really bad job.|s
me018|who was it trained on?|qw
me011|uh i have no idea.|h|s^no
me011|i don't remember.|s^no
me018|huh.|b
me011|does do you remember morgan?|qy^rt
me011|was it broadcast news?|qy^rt
me013|i think so yeah.|s^aa
me011|um so at any rate my next attempt which i'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the uh thresholding as the way of generating the candidates.|fg|s
me011|because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks.|s
me011|all of which are definitely acoustic events.|s
me011|they're definitely someone talking.|s
me011|but like it could be someone who isn't the person here but the person over there or it can be the person breathing.|s
me011|and then feeding that into the acoustic change detector.|s
me011|and so i think that might work.|s
me011|but i haven't gotten very far on that.|s
me011|but all of this is close talking mike.|s
me011|so|fh
me011|it's uh just just trying to get some ground truth.|s
mn005|only with uh uh|s.%--
mn005|but uh i i i think uh when when i i saw the the the the speech from p d a and uh close talker.|s
mn005|i i think the there is a a great difference in the in the signal.|s
me011|oh absolutely.|s^aa
me011|so my intention for this is is as an aide for ground truth.|s
mn005|um but uh i but uh i i i mean that uh uh in the in the mixed file you can find uh zone with uh great different uh level of energy.|fg|s
me011|not|%-
mn005|um i i think for uh algorithm based on energy uh that um huh more or less uh like uh uh huh first sound energy detector.|fh|s
me011|say it again?|qy^br^d^rt
mn005|uh nnn.|h
mn005|when you the detect the the the first at at the end of of the detector of um um.|s
mn005|what is the the name in english?|qw^t1
mn005|the the huh the detector of um of a word in the in the in an isolated word in in the background that uh|s.%-
me011|i'm i'm not sure what you're saying.|s^br
me011|can you try|qy.%-
mn005|i mean that when when you use uh uh any|s.%-
me018|i think he's saying the onset detector.|s
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me011|onset detector okay.|s^bk
mn005|i i think it's probably to work well uh because uh you have uh in the mixed files a great level of energy.|s
mn005|uh and great difference between the speaker.|s
mn005|and probably is not so easy when you use the the p d a uh that because the signal is uh the in the energy level.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
mn005|in in that uh uh speech file is uh more similar.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
mn005|between the different uh speaker um i i think is uh it will is my opinion.|s
me011|but different speakers.|s
mn005|it will be uh more difficult to to detect bass tone energy.|s
mn005|the the change.|s
mn005|i think that um|s.%-
me011|uh in the in the p d a you mean?|qy^bu^d
mn005|in the p d a.|s^na
me011|absolutely.|s^aa
me011|yeah no question.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|it'll be much harder.|s^na
me011|much harder.|s^na
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and the the another question that when i review the the the work of javier.|s
mn005|i think the nnn the nnn that the idea of using a neural network to to get a broad class of phonetic uh from uh uh a candidate from the the the speech signal.|s
mn005|if you have uh uh i'm considering only because javier uh only consider uh like candidate the nnn uh the silence because it is the the only model uh uh he used that uh uh nnn to detect the the possibility of a a change between the between the speaker.|s
me011|right.|b
mn005|um another another research thing different groups uh working uh on broadcast news prefer to uh to consider hypothesis uh between each phoneme.|fh|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me011|yeah when a phone changes.|s
mn005|because i i i think it's more realistic that uh only consider the the the the silence between the speaker.|s
mn005|uh there there exists uh silence between between uh a speaker.|s
mn005|is is uh uh acoustic uh event important to to consider.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i i found that the uh silence in in many occasions in the in the speech file.|s
mn005|but uh when you have uh uh two speakers together without enough silence between between them uh i think uh is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and i i i i x or huh bic criterion for consider all the frames in my opinion.|s^cs
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah the you know the reason that he uh just used silence was not because he thought it was better it was it was it was the place he was starting.|fg|s^ng
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so he was trying to get something going.|s
mn005|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|b
me013|and uh you know as as as is in your case if you're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|do something.|s^2
mn005|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|b
me013|but his his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
mn005|but uh do do you think that if you consider all the frames to apply the the uh the bic criterion to detect the the the different acoustic change uh between speaker?|fg|qy
mn005|without uh with uh silence or with overlapping.|s^e
mn005|uh|fh
mn005|i think like like uh uh a general uh uh way of process the the acoustic change.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|in a first step i mean.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and then uh uh without considering the you you you um you can consider the energy like another parameter in the in the feature vector.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
me011|absolutely.|s^aa
mn005|uh|fh
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|this this is the idea.|s
mn005|and if if you do that uh uh with a bic uh criterion for example or with another kind of uh of distance in a first step and then you uh you get the uh the hypothesis to the this change acoustic uh to process.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
mn005|because uh uh probably you you can find the the uh a small gap of silence between speaker with uh uh a huh small duration less than uh two hundred milliseconds for example.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and apply another another algorithm another approach like uh uh detector of uh detector of bass tone energy to to consider that uh that uh zone of a small silence between speaker.|s
mn005|or another algorithm to to process uh the the segment between marks uh founded by the the the bic criterion and applied for for each frame.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i think is uh nnn it will be an an a more general approach the if we compare with use uh a neural net or another uh speech recognizer with a broad class or or narrow class.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|because in my opinion uh it's in my opinion uh if you if you change the condition of the speech i mean if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to uh to uh adapt the neural net uh used by javier with a mixed file.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|with the what file?|qw^br^d^rt
mn005|uh with a mixed file.|s
mn005|with a the mix mix.|s^r
fe008|mixed.|s^bc
me018|mixed.|s^bc
me011|mixed?|qy^br^d^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|sorry.|s^fa
mn005|and and then you you uh you try to to apply that uh uh uh speech recognizer to that signal to the p d a uh speech file i i think you will have problems because the the the the condition you you will need i i suppose that you will need to to to retrain it.|s
me011|oh absolutely.|s^aa
me013|well i i|fg|s.%-
me011|this is this is not what i was suggesting to do.|s^na
me013|look i i think this is a|fg|s.%--
mn005|really?|qy^bh
me013|one once it's a i used to work like on voiced on voice silence detection you know and this is this kind of thing.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um if you have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing and they work on it for a couple months they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily.|s
me013|then you say okay i don't just want to get most of the cases i want it to be really accurate.|s
me013|then it gets really hard no matter what you do.|s
me013|so the the problem is is that if you say well i i have these other data over here that i learn things from either explicit training of neural nets or of gaussian mixture models or whatever.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|uh suppose you don't use any of those things.|fh|s
me013|you say you have looked for acoustic change.|s
me013|well what does that mean?|qw
me013|that that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and and so where do you get your thresholds from?|qw
me013|from something that you looked at.|s
me013|so you always have this problem you're going to new data.|fh|s
me013|um how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data uh if it's going to be different from old data that you have?|fh|qw
me013|and i think that's a problem with this.|s
me011|well also what i'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far field mikes.|fg|s
me011|what i'm doing is trying to use the close talking mike and just use and just generate candidate and just try to get a first pass at something that sort of works.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn017|actually actually actually|fg
me018|you have candidates.|s^2
mn005|the candidate.|s^2
mn017|i|%-
me018|to make marking easier.|s^2
mn017|or|%--
me018|yeah.|b
me011|and i haven't spent a lot of time on it and i'm not intending to spend a lot of time on it.|s
mn017|okay.|b
mn017|i um i unfortunately have to run.|s
me011|so|fh
mn017|but um i can imagine uh building a um model of speaker change detection that takes into account both the far field and the uh actually not just the close talking mike for that speaker but actually for all of for all of the speakers.|s
me011|yep.|s^bk
me011|everyone else.|s^2
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|um if you model the the effect that me speaking has on your microphone and everybody else's microphone as well as on that and you build um|fh|s.%--
mn017|basically i think you'd you would build a an h m m that has as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations.|s
me011|all the yep.|s^2|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
mn017|and um you can control|fh|s.%-
me011|it's a little big.|s
mn017|it's not that big actually.|s^nd
mn017|um.|fh
me011|two to the n.|s^df^nd
me011|two to the number of people in the meeting.|s^df^nd
me013|but actually andreas maybe maybe just something simpler but but along the lines of what you're saying.|fg|s^cs
me011|anyway.|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|i was just realizing i used to know this guy who used to build uh um mike mixers automatic mike mixers where you know in order to able to turn up the gain you know uh as much as you can you you you lower the gain on on the mikes of people who aren't talking.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and then he had some sort of reasonable way of doing that.|s
me013|but uh what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold overall but you compare it to the energy in the other microphones?|qw^cs
me011|i was thinking about doing that originally to find out who's the loudest.|s^na
me011|and that person is certainly talking.|s^e^rt
me013|yeah.|b
me011|but i also wanted to find threshold uh excuse me overlap.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so not just just the loudest.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|but uh|fh
mn005|i i sorry.|s^fa
mn005|i i have found that when when i i analyzed the the speech files from the uh mike uh from the uh close uh microphone uh i found zones with a a different level of energy.|s
mn017|sorry i have to go.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk^t3
me011|could you fill that out anyway?|qy^cs^t3
me011|just put your name in.|s^co^t3
me011|are you want me to do it?|qy^d^rt^t3
me011|i'll do it.|s^cc^t3
me018|but he's not going to even read that.|s^ng^t3
me011|i know.|s^na^t3
me018|oh.|s^bk
mn005|including overlap zone.|s
mn005|including.|s^bsc
mn005|because uh uh depend on the position of the of the of the each speaker to uh to get more or less energy in the mixed in the signal.|s
mn005|and then if you consider energy to to detect overlapping in in uh and you process the the in the the the speech file from the the the mixed signals.|s
mn005|the mixed signals uh.|s^bsc
mn005|i i think it's it's difficult um only to with energy to to consider that in that zone we have uh uh overlapping zone uh if you process only the the energy of the of each frame.|s
me013|well it's probably harder.|s^aap
me013|but i i think what i was nnn noting just when he when andreas raised that was that there's other information to be gained from looking at all of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|because if there's if most of the overlaps you know this doesn't cover say three but if most of the overlaps say are two if the distribution looks like there's a couple high ones and and the rest of them are low.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|and everyone else is low yeah.|s^2
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|you know what i mean?|qy^d^f^rt
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|there's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|uh by the way i had an idea with while i was watching chuck nodding at a lot of these things is that we can all wear little bells on our heads so that then you'd know that.|s^cs^j
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|ding ding ding ding.|s^j
fe008|ding.|s^j
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|that's cute.|s^ba
fe016|i think that'd be really interesting too with blindfolds.|s^cs^na
me011|nodding with blindfolds.|s^rt
fe016|then|%--
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|what are you nodding about?|qw^j
fe016|the question is like whether|s.%--
fe016|well trying with and with and without yeah.|s^cs
me011|sorry i'm just i'm just going to sleep.|s^fa^j
fe016|but then there's just one like.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|actually i saw a uh a woman at the bus stop the other day who um was talking on her cell phone speaking japanese and was bowing.|s
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me018|you know profusely.|s^e
fe016|oh yeah that's really common.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|uh.|b
me018|just kept|s.%-
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|wow.|s^ba
fe016|it's very difficult if you try while you're trying say to convince somebody on the phone it's difficult not to move your hands.|s^rt
fe016|not you know if you watch people they'll actually do these things.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so|fh
fe016|i still think we should try a a meeting or two with the blindfolds.|s^cs
fe016|at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah i think|s^aa.%-
fe016|um maybe for part of the meeting we don't have to do it the whole meeting.|s^cs
me013|i think it's a great idea.|s^ba^na
fe016|that could be fun.|s
fe016|it'll be too hard to make barriers i was thinking because they have to go all the way.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|you know i can see chuck even if you put a barrier here.|s^rt
me011|well we could just turn out the lights.|fg|s^cs
fe008|actually well also i i can say i made barriers for so that the stuff i was doing with collin which just used um this kind of foam board.|fg|s^rt
fe016|yeah?|qy^bh^d^rt
fe008|really inexpensive.|s^e
fe008|you can you can masking tape it together.|s^cs
fe008|these are you know pretty large partitions.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|but then we also have these mikes is the other thing i was thinking.|s^cs
fe016|so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb the sound.|s^cs
me011|the acoustics.|s^2
fe008|it's true it would disturb the um the the long range.|s^na
fe016|um|fh
me013|blindfolds would be good.|s^cs^na
me011|i think blindfolds.|s^cs^na
fe008|it would|%
fe016|i mean it sounds weird but but you know it's it's cheap and uh be interesting to have the camera going.|s
me013|probably we should wait until after adam's set up the mikes.|s^cs
me013|but|fh
fe008|okay.|b
fe008|i think we're going to have to work on the uh on the human subjects form.|s^cs
me018|i'll be peeking.|s^j
me011|yeah that's right we didn't tell them we would be blindfolding.|s
me013|that's|s.%-
fe008|do you mind being blindfolded while you're interviewed?|qy^j
me013|that's that's that's the one that we videotape.|s^co^j
me013|so|fh
me013|um i i want to move this along.|fh|s^co^tc
me013|uh i did have this other agenda item which is uh it's uh a list which i sent to uh a couple folks but um i wanted to get broader input on it.|fh|s^t
me013|so this is the things that i think we did in the last three months.|s
me013|obviously not everything we did but but sort of highlights that i can can tell some outside person you know what what were you actually working on.|s^e
me013|um in no particular order uh one uh ten more hours of meeting meetings recorded something like that you know from from uh three months ago.|fh|s
me013|uh x m l formats and other transcription aspects sorted out and uh sent to i b m.|fh|s
me013|um pilot data put together and sent to i b m for transcription.|fh|s
me013|uh next batch of recorded data put together on the c d roms for shipment to i b m.|fh|s
me011|hasn't been sent yet but it's getting ready.|s
me013|but yeah that's why i phrased it that way yeah okay.|s^df
me013|um human subjects approval on campus uh and release forms worked out.|fh|s
me013|so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of selected parts of the their speech.|s^rt
me013|um audio pixelization software written and tested.|fh|s^rt
me013|um preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed.|fh|s
me013|and exploratory analysis of long distance inferences for topic coherence that was i was wasn't sure if those were the right way that was the right way to describe that because of that little exercise that that you and and lokendra did.|s
fe008|what was that called?|qw^bu
fe008|the uh say again.|s^br
me013|i well i'm probably saying this wrong but what i said was exploratory analysis of long distance inferences for topic coherence.|s
me013|something like that.|s
me013|um so uh i a lot of that was from you know what what what you two were doing.|fh|s
me013|so i i sent it to you.|s
me013|and you know please mail me you know the corrections or suggestions for changing.|s^cs
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|i i don't want to make this twice it's length but but you know just improve it.|s
me013|um is there anything anybody|fh|s.%-
me011|i i did a bunch of stuff for supporting of digits.|s
me013|bunch of stuff for|s^bk^m.%-
me013|okay maybe maybe send me a sentence that's a little thought through about that.|s^co
me011|so okay i'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say a bunch of?|qy^bu^cc^d^rt
me013|bunch of stuff yeah stuff is probably bad too.|s^nd
me011|yep.|b
me011|stuff is not very technical.|s^na
me013|yeah well.|s^aa
me011|i'll try to phrase it in passive voice.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah yeah.|b
me018|technical stuff.|s
me013|range of things yeah.|s^cs
me013|um and and you know i sort of threw in what you did with what jane did on in under the uh uh preliminary analysis of overlaps.|fh|s
me013|uh uh thilo can you tell us about all the work you've done on this project in the last uh last three months?|fh|qy^co^rt^t^tc
mn005|yeah.|b
mn014|so what is what um|qy.%-
me013|that's|%-
mn014|not really.|s^ar
me018|it's too complicated.|s
mn014|um i didn't get it.|fh|s^no
mn014|what is audio pixelization?|qw
me013|uh audio he did it.|h|s
me013|so why don't you explain it quickly?|qw^co
me011|it's just uh beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting.|s
me011|so you know you can say things like well this should probably not be on the record but beep.|s
mn014|okay okay.|b
mn014|i got that.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|we we we spent a a a fair amount of time early on just dealing with this issue about op we realized well people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later and how do you get around that.|s
mn014|okay.|b
me013|so in the consent form it says well you we will look at the transcripts later and if there's something that you're unhappy with yeah.|s
mn014|okay and you can say|s.%--
mn014|okay.|b
me013|but you don't want to just totally excise it.|s
me013|because|%--
me013|um|fh
me013|uh well you have to be careful about excising it how how you excise it.|s
me013|keeping the timing right and so forth.|s^e
me013|so that at the moment the idea we're running with is is putting the beep over it.|s^e
me011|yeah you can either beep or it can be silence.|s
mn014|okay.|fh
me011|i i couldn't decide which was the right way to do it.|s^no
mn005|uh yeah.|b
me011|beep is good auditorily.|s
me011|if someone is listening to it there's no mistake that it's been beeped out.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|but for software it's probably better for it to be silence.|s^cs
me018|no no.|s^ar
me018|you can you know you could make a as long as you keep using the same beep people could make a model of that beep.|s^nd
fe008|huh.|b
me011|yep.|s^bk
me018|and|fh
fe008|i like that idea.|s^ba
me011|and i use it's it's uh it's an a below middle c beep.|s
fe016|i think the beep is a really good idea.|s^ba
fe008|it's very clear.|s
me018|yeah.|b
fe008|then you don't think it's a long pause.|s
fe016|also|%-
me011|so|fh
me018|yeah it's more obvious that there was something there than if there's just silence.|s^na
me013|yeah that i mean he's he's removing the old thing.|fg|s^bu
fe008|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
me013|and and and|fh
me018|right.|s^aa
me018|right.|s^aa
me011|yeah it's not|s.%-
me018|but i mean if you just replaced it with silence it's not clear whether that's really silence or|s.%--
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah i agree.|s^aa
me011|yep.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|one one question.|s
fe008|do you do it on all channels?|qy^rt
me011|of course.|s^aa
fe008|interesting.|s^ba
fe008|i like that.|s^ba
me011|yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's uh audible.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah i like that.|s^ba
fe008|very clear.|s^ba
fe008|very clear.|s^ba^r
me011|uh it's it's potentially audible you could potentially recover it.|s
me013|keep a back door.|s
fe008|well the other thing that you know i mean the the alternative might be to|s.%-
me011|yeah.|b
me011|well i i haven't thrown away any of the meetings that i beeped.|s
me011|actually yours is the only one that i beeped and then uh the darpa meeting.|s
fe016|notice how quiet i am.|s
me011|sorry.|s^fa
me011|and then the darpa meeting i just excised completely.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|so it's in a private directory.|s
fe008|that's great.|s^ba
fe016|you have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings.|s^j
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|b
me018|they're easy to find then.|s^j
me013|all right so uh i think we should uh uh go on to the digits.|s^co^rt^t^tc
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe008|i have one concept i i want to say which is that i think it's nice that you're preserving the time relations.|s^ba^tc
fe008|so you're you're not just cutting you're not doing scissor snips.|s^e
me011|right.|s^bk
fe008|you're you're keeping the uh the time duration of a deleted deleted part.|s
fe016|yeah definitely.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|okay good digits.|s^bk|s^t^tc
me011|yeah since we want to possibly synchronize these things as well.|s^tc
me011|oh i should have done that.|s
me011|shoot!|s^fe
fe008|it's great.|s^ba
me011|oh well.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|oh|%-
fe016|so i guess if there's an overlap like if i'm saying something that's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped too?|qy^d
me011|you'll lose it.|s
me011|there's no way around that.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|um i i did before we do the digits i did also want to remind people uh please do send me you know uh thoughts for an agenda.|fh|s^co^t^tc
me011|agenda?|qy^2^d^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|that that would be that'd be good.|s
fe008|good.|s^ba
me013|uh so that uh people's ideas don't get|s.%-
me011|thursday crept up on me this week.|s
me013|yeah well it does creep up.|s^na
me013|doesn't it?|qy^d^g
me013|okay.|fh
fe016|and i wanted to say i think this is really interesting analysis.|s
me011|it's cool stuff definitely.|s^na
fe008|thank you.|s^ft
fe008|thank you.|s^ft^r
fe016|i meant to say that before i started off on the switchboard stuff.|s
me011|i was going to say can you do that for the other meetings.|s^j
fe016|it's neat.|s^ba
me011|can you do it for them?|qy^j
me011|and no actually you can't.|s^ar^j
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|does it take|qy.%-
me018|actually actually i i thought that's what you were giving us was another meeting and i was like oh okay.|s
fe008|thank you.|s^ft
me011|ooo cool!|s^fe
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|aw thanks.|s^ft
fe016|how long does it take just briefly like to okay to label the|qw.%-
fe008|no.|s^ar
fe008|i have the script now.|s
fe008|so i mean it can work off the uh other thing.|s
me011|it's as soon as we get labels yep.|s
fe016|okay.|b
me018|but it has to be hand labeled first?|qy^d
fe008|but|%-
fe008|uh well yeah.|h|s^aa
fe008|because uh well i mean once his his algorithm is up and running then we can do it that way.|s
me011|if it works well enough.|s
me011|right now it's not not quite to the point where it works.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe008|but i i just worked off of my|s.%--
me013|okay go ahead|s.%-
fe016|it's really neat.|s^ba
fe008|thanks.|s^ft
fe008|appreciate that.|s^ft
fe008|i think what i what this has uh caused me so this discussion caused me to want to subdivide these further.|s
fe008|i'm going to take a look at the uh backchannels.|s^cc
fe008|how much we have i hope to have that for next time.|s
me011|yeah my my algorithm worked great actually on these.|s^rt
me018|that'd be interesting.|s^ba
me011|but when you wear it like that or with the uh lapel or if you have it very far from your face that's when it starts failing.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|well i can wear it i mean if you|s^cc.%-
me018|oh.|b
me011|it doesn't matter.|s^aap
fe016|okay.|b
me011|i mean we want it to work.|s^df
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me018|it's too late now.|s^nd
me011|i i don't want to change the way we do the meeting.|s^df
fe016|i feel like this troublemaker.|s^j
me011|it's uh so it was just a comment on the software not a comment on prescriptions on how you wear microphones.|s^df
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay that's let's let's let's do digits.|s^co
me011|get the bolts whh whh.|s
fe008|let's do it.|s^co
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe016|i'm sorry.|z
me011|okay thank you.|z
fe008|do you want us to put a mark on the bottom of these when they've actually been read or|z
fe008|do you just|z
fe008|the only one that wasn't read is|z
fe008|is known so we don't do it.|z
fe008|okay.|z
