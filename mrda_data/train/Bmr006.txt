me013|so uh so the uh the new procedural change that just got suggested which i think is a good idea is that um we do the digit recordings at the end.|fg
me013|and that way if we're recording somebody else's uh meeting and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time uh then they can run off.|s
me013|it'll mean we'll get somewhat fewer uh sets of digits.|s
me013|but um i think that way we'll cut into people's time um if someone's on strict time uh less.|fh
me013|so i i think i think we should start doing that.|cs
me013|um so uh let's see we were having a discussion the other day maybe we should bring that up about uh the nature of the data that we are collecting.|fh
me013|uh that uh we should have a fair amount of data that is um collected for the same meeting so that we can|fh
me013|uh|fh
me013|i don't know.|no
me013|what what were some of the points again about that?|rt
me013|is it|qy
fe016|uh well okay i'll back up.|h
fe016|um at the previous at last week's meeting this meeting i was griping about wanting to get more data.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|and i i talked about this with jane and adam.|s
fe016|um and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um since we'll have a new this new student does want to work with us.|fh
fe016|the guy that was at the last meeting.|s
me018|well great.|ba
me018|great.|ba
fe016|and he's already funded part time.|s
fe016|so we'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part time.|s
me018|what a deal.|ba
fe016|uh yeah.|bk
me011|and what's he interested in specifically?|rt
fe016|so|%--
fe016|he's comes from a signal processing background.|s
fe016|but i liked him a lot.|s
fe016|because he's very interested in higher level things like language and disfluencies and all kinds of maybe prosody.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so he's just getting his feet wet in that.|s
me011|great.|ba
fe016|anyway i thought okay maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he'd be starting in january next semester that we'd have you know enough data to work with.|fh
me011|right.|b
fe016|but um jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want and so forth.|fh
fe016|so i thought about that and i think it's still possible.|fh
fe016|um but i'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about and hear then sort of a mish mosh of a bunch of one onetime.|fh
me011|one offs.|2
fe016|yeah just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses.|s
fe016|both to get the um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it like well i was talking to morgan about.|s
fe016|things like summarization or what's this meeting about.|e
fe016|i mean it's very different if you have a group that's just giving a report on what they did that week versus coming to a decision and so forth.|fh
fe016|so then i was um talking to morgan about some new proposed work in this area sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where i was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns.|fh
fe016|like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech.|e
fe016|sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to.|s
fe016|and in that uh regard i thought we definitely will need it'd it'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains or a few different kinds of meetings.|cs
fe016|so this this meeting is one of them.|s
fe016|although i'm not sure i can participate if i|s
fe016|you know i would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analyzing later for things like summarization.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|um and then there are some others that that morgan mentioned.|fh
fe016|like the front end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting.|e
me011|right.|aa
me011|yep.|aa
me011|yeah we're we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly.|fg
fe016|so so if that were the case then i think we'd have enough.|s
me011|so|fh
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|but basically for anything where you're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting um it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize.|s
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries.|cs
fe016|and then we need a couple that of we don't want to just have one group.|co
fe016|because that might be specific to that particular group but three or four different kinds.|co
me013|so|fg
me011|yeah we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting.|s
fe016|see i've never listened to the data for the front end meeting.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yeah we we've only had three.|s
me011|so|fh
fe016|okay.|bk
fe016|but maybe that's enough.|s
fe016|so in general i was thinking more data.|s
fe016|but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar.|s
fe016|like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same.|e
me011|uhhuh.|b
me011|um|fg
me013|now let let me just give you the other side to that.|fg
me013|because i because i i don't disagree with that.|df
me013|but i think there is a complimentary piece to it too.|aap
me013|uh for other kinds of research particularly the acoustic oriented research i actually feel the opposite need.|fh
me013|i'd like to have lots of different people.|cs
fe016|right.|b
fe016|right.|b
me013|as many people here and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view.|nd
me013|i'd like to have many different speakers.|cs
me013|so um i think i would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings of somebody coming down from campus and and uh|fh
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean sure if we can get more from them fine.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right.|b
me013|but if we only get one or two from each group that still could be useful acoustically just because we'd have close and distant microphones with different people.|s
fe016|yeah i definitely agree with that.|aa
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|definitely.|aa
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|can i can i say about that that the the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers.|s
fe008|because i think if you just say|s
fe008|and in particular my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you'd have people who'd have proficiency enough in english that that uh it would be useful for for purposes you know.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|but you know i think i've been i've i i've gathered data from undergrads at on campus.|s
fe008|and if you just post randomly to undergrads i think you'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you'd have at all and and the english you'd have the language models would be really hard to build.|s
me013|well you want to|fg
fe008|because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a|s
me013|well okay uh first place i i i don't think we'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another.|fg
fe008|okay.|bk
me013|i think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point because i i think that's what we're investigating.|cs
fe016|it has to be a a pre-existing meeting like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway.|cs
me013|so|fh
me013|yeah yeah.|aa
me011|right.|b
fe008|okay.|bk
me013|so i was i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh and and and uh senior uh uh and uh doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here.|fg
me011|yep.|b
fe016|that's i think what we and i agree with.|df
fe008|oh interesting!|ba
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|oh i see.|bk
fe008|oh interesting!|ba
me013|uh that's the first point.|s
me013|the second point is|s
me013|um|fh
me013|i think that for some time now going back through berp i think that we have had speakers that we've worked with who had non native accents and i i think that|s
fe008|oh oh i'm not saying accents.|fg
fe008|the accent's not the problem.|nd
me013|oh okay.|bk
fe008|no it's more a matter of uh proficiency.|ar
fe008|just simply fluency.|s
fe008|i mean i deal with people on on campus who i think sometimes people undergraduates um in computer science uh have language skills that make you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|oh!|fe
me013|you're not talking about foreign language at all.|s
me011|yeah yeah just talking about.|na
me013|you're just talking about|s
fe008|well i just think|fg
me011|we all had the same thought.|na
fe008|but you know it's like when you get into the graduate level uh no problem.|s
fe008|i mean i'm not saying accents.|df
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah then we're completely gone.|s
fe008|i'm i'm saying fluency.|df
me013|it's the the habits are already burnt in.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|well yeah.|b
fe008|i'm just saying fluency.|df
me013|but|fh
me011|well i think that um i think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in english.|cs
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and and i think if it's a pre existing meeting and it's held in english i i think it's probably okay if a few of the people don't have uh particularly good english skills.|s
fe008|okay now can i can i say the other aspect of this from my perspective.|cs
fe008|which is that um there's there's this this issue you have a corpus out there it should be used for for multiple things.|cs
fe008|because it's so expensive to put together.|df
me011|right.|aa
me013|right.|b
fe008|and if people want to approach|s
fe008|um|fh
fe008|i so i know you know this|s
fe008|the idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|but the idea of language models which are you know generally speaking uh you know terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|if you have a choice between people who are more proficient in um more fluent more more close to being academic english then it would seem to me to be a good thing.|s
me013|i guess maybe|s
me013|huh.|b
fe008|because otherwise you don't have the ability to have|s
fe008|uh so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that's the worst possible case.|s
fe008|if you have people who are using english as a as an interlanguage because they they don't uh they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing uh language model.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|this is the worst case scenario.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|well that's pretty much what you're going to have in the networking group.|s
fe008|and|s
me011|right.|b
me013|because because they most the network group is almost entirely germans and spaniards.|s
fe008|well|fg
fe008|oh.|bk
fe008|but the thing is i think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that|df
me013|i see.|bk
fe008|and i'm not objecting to accents.|df
fe008|i i'm i'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view could we have a language model a a grammar a grammar basically that um would be a a possibility.|cs
me013|okay.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|so so if you wanted to bring in a model like dan jurafsky's model and do some top down stuff it to help the bottom up and merge the things or whatever uh it seems like um i don't see that there's an argument.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|i'm i what i think is that why not have the corpus since it's so expensive to put together uh useful for the widest range of of central things that people generally use corpora for and which are you know used in computational linguistics.|cs
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|that's that's my point which which includes both top down and bottom up.|bs
me013|okay.|b
mn005|it's difficult.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|okay well let's let's see what we can get.|cs
me013|i mean it it i think that if we're aiming at at uh groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together and it's from the berkeley campus probably most of it will be okay.|s
fe008|yes that's fine.|aa
fe008|that's fine.|aa
fe008|exactly.|aa
fe008|and my point in in my note to liz was i think that undergrads are an iffy population.|s
me013|but|fh
me013|okay.|b
fe016|i definitely agree with that i mean for this purpose.|na
me013|okay.|b
me013|okay.|b
fe008|grads and professors fine.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|well not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen probably even anyone under twenty one.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|so|fh
me013|oh you age-ist!|fe
me011|what's that?|br
fe008|age-ist.|s
me011|well age-ist the eighteen is because of the consent form.|df
fe016|right yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|we'd have to get find their parent to sign for them.|df
mn005|age-ist.|s
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me013|yes.|b
fe008|yeah that's true.|aa
me011|so|b
fe016|i have a uh um question.|s
fe016|well morgan you were mentioning that mari may not use the equipment from i b m if they found something else because there's a|s
me013|they're they're yeah they're they're uh assessing whether they should do that or do something else hopefully over the next few weeks.|s
fe016|because i mean one remote possibility is that if we if we inherited that equipment if she weren't using it could we set up a room in the linguistics department?|cs
fe016|and and i mean there there may be a lot more or or in psych or in wherever in another building where we could um record people there.|cs
fe016|i think we'd have a better chance.|s
me011|i think we'd need a real motivated partner to do that.|cs
fe016|right.|f
me011|we'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this.|cs
fe016|but|%--
fe016|right.|bk
fe016|but if there were such a|s
fe016|i mean it's a remote possibility then um you know one of us could you know go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here.|cs
me011|yep.|b
fe016|so it's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware.|s
me013|well the other thing yeah i mean the other thing that i was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around.|fg
me011|right.|b
me013|uh.|b
me013|but um and|fh
me011|well i know that space is really scarce on at least in c s.|s
me013|uh.|b
me011|you know to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|but you may not need a separate room you know.|arp
me011|that's true.|aa
fe016|the idea is if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|true.|aa
me011|uhhuh.|b
me011|yep.|b
me013|well maybe john would let us put it into the phonology lab or something.|s
fe016|huh.|fh
me011|yep.|b
me013|you know.|fh
fe016|i i think it's not out of the question.|na
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yeah i think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting.|s
fe016|um.|fh
fe016|so|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|another type of meeting.|s
fe016|right.|b
fe016|right.|b
mn005|but i i i think you need uh another portable thing another portable equipment to to do uh more easier the recording process uh out from icsi.|cs
me011|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|uh and probably i don't know.|fh
me013|yeah.|b
me011|right.|b
mn005|uh if you you want to to record uh a seminar or a class uh in the university you you need it it would be uh uh very difficult to to put uh a lot of uh head phones uh in different people when you have to to record only with uh this kind of uh device.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yeah but|fg
me011|i think if we if we want to just record with the tabletop microphones that's easy.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me011|right?|d
me011|that's very easy.|s
me011|but that's not the corpus that we're collecting.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|actually that's a that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating.|s
me013|we realized that um when we were talking about this that okay there's these different things that we want to do with it.|s
me013|so um it's true that we want to be selective in some ways uh the way that you were speaking about with uh not having an interlingua and uh these other issues.|fh
me013|but on the other hand it's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it.|s
me013|so as per the example that we want to have a fair amount that's done with a small recorded with a small uh number of types of meetings.|s
me013|but we can also have another part that's uh just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them.|s
me013|and that's okay too.|s
me013|uh we realized in discussion that the other thing is what about this business of distant and close microphones.|fh
me013|i mean we really want to have a substantial amount recorded this way.|s
me013|that's why we did it.|s
me013|but what about for for these issues of summarization a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone.|s
fe016|right.|aa
fe016|i mean i i think there's|s
me013|you actually don't.|s
me011|and you don't really need the close microphone you mean.|nd
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah yeah you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone.|na
fe008|which one did you mean?|qw
me013|you you don't it doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere.|na
fe016|you can use found data.|s
me011|yeah yep.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|tape recorder.|na
fe008|oh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|you you can.|s
me013|you need some microphone.|s
fe016|you can.|s
fe016|use um but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect|cs
me013|but i mean|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|you know each person who's interested in i mean we have a we have a bunch of different um slants and perspectives on what it's useful for um they need to be taking charge of making sure they're getting enough of the kind of data that they want.|co
me013|right.|b
fe016|and so in my case um i think there there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others.|s
me011|not enough for others right.|2
fe016|and so i'm looking and thinking well i'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it's to help in my interest.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and other people need to do that for themselves uh or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal.|co
me013|right so that|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but i think that i'm raising that because i think it's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about well gee we have this really complicated setup to do well maybe you don't.|s
me013|maybe if if if really all you want is to have a a a recording that's good enough to get a uh a transcription from later you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording.|cs
me011|yeah.|b
me011|for some of it.|aap
fe016|right.|b
me011|yep.|b
me013|i mean we we could have a fairly we could just get a dat machine and|cs
fe016|well i agree with jane though on the other hand that|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|so that might be true you may say for instance summarization or something that sounds very language oriented.|s
fe016|you may say well oh yeah you just do that from transcripts of a radio show.|s
fe016|i mean you don't even need the speech signal.|s
me013|right.|b
fe016|but what you what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um|cs
fe016|suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this.|s
fe016|there's lots of cues you're not going to have.|s
fe016|so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information which is really what makes this corpus powerful.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|special?|2
me011|yep.|b
me013|i i i i i agree.|aa
fe016|otherwise you know lots of other sites can propose individual studies so|s
me013|uh but i i think that the uh we can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up.|fh
me011|yep.|b
me013|and so uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say oh we'll just do it up there .|s
fe016|okay.|b
me013|if you're talking about something simple where you throw away a lot of these dimensions then you can do that right away.|s
me013|talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here.|s
me013|it won't happen quickly it won't be easy and there's all sorts of issues about you know keeping the equipment safe or else hauling it around and all sorts of|s
fe016|so then maybe we should try to bring people here.|cs
me013|i think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here.|na
me011|here.|2
fe016|i mean that's that's|s
fe016|okay so.|bk
me013|we're set up for it.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|okay.|b
me013|the room is is really uh underused.|s
fe016|right.|b
me013|uh|fh
fe008|i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea.|s
me011|yeah i thought so too.|aa
fe016|yeah i and i think we can get people to come here that|aa
me013|free lunch is good.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|but the issue is you definitely want to make sure that the kind of group you're getting is the right group.|cs
fe016|so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down.|df
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me018|no crunchy food.|cs
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so well it would be lunch afterwards.|ng
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|well i was thinking lunch after.|ng
fe016|right.|aa
fe016|and they'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert.|co
me013|yeah they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food.|co
me011|yep.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|um i had a i spoke with some people up at haas business school who volunteered.|fg
me011|should i pursue that?|rt
fe016|oh definitely yeah.|aa
me011|yeah.|bk
me013|yeah.|aa
me011|so|fg
me011|they they originally they've decided not to do go into speech.|s
me011|so i'm not sure whether they'll still be so willing to volunteer.|s
me011|but i'll send an email and ask.|cc
me013|tell them about the free lunch.|co
me011|i'll tell them about the free lunch.|na
fe016|yeah.|aa
fe016|yeah.|aa
me011|and they'll say there's no such thing.|j
me011|so|fh
fe016|i'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers because these are both weird.|cs
me011|right.|bk
me013|yeah.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|the the the the other|s
fe016|well i know i shouldn't say that.|s
me011|that's all right.|s
me011|no they they're very weird.|na
fe016|we need a wider sampling.|co
me018|beep.|j
me013|uh|fg
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|beep.|j
me013|uh the the|fg
me011|the problem with engineers is beep.|j
me013|they make funny sounds.|na
me013|the the the other the other thing is uh that we we talked about is give to them uh burn an extra c d rom.|tc
me011|yep let them have their meeting.|bk
me013|and give them so if they want a basically and audio record of their|s
fe016|well i thought that was i thought he meant give them a music c d like they then he said a c d of the of their speech.|s
me013|oh.|bk
fe016|and i guess it depends of what kind of audience you're talking to.|bd
fe016|but you know i personally would not want a c d of my meeting.|s
me011|of the meeting.|2
fe016|but maybe yeah maybe you're|s
me013|if you're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you'd like|ng
fe016|right right right.|b
me018|oh that's a good idea.|ba
me011|it'd be fun.|ba
me013|yeah.|b
me011|i think it would just be fun you know if nothing else you know.|ba
fe016|right.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but it it it it also i think builds up towards the goal.|s
me011|it's a novelty item.|s
fe016|right.|b
me013|we're saying look you know you're going to get this.|s
me013|isn't that neat.|s
me013|then you're going to go home with it.|s
me013|it's actually it's probably going to be pretty useless to you.|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|but you'll appreciate you know where it's useful and where it's useless.|s
fe016|right.|b
me013|and then we're going to move this technology so it'll become useful.|s
fe016|no i think that's a great idea actually.|ba
me013|so|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|but we might need a little more to incentivize them that's all.|cs
me018|what if you could tell them that you'll give them the the transcripts when they come back?|cs
me011|oh yeah.|bk
me011|i mean anyone can have the transcripts so i thought we could point that out.|s
me013|oh yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|well that's interesting.|ba
fe008|i i have to uh raise a little eensy weensy concern about doing giving them the c d immediately because of these issues of you know this kind of stuff where maybe you know.|s
me013|good point.|ba
fe008|so|fh
me013|that's a very good point.|ba
fe008|we could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage.|cs
me013|so we can so we can|s
me013|right.|bk
fe008|and then they they get a c d but just not the same day.|cs
fe016|oh right.|b
fe016|if it should be the same c d rom that we distribute publically.|bu
me011|yeah that's right.|aa
me011|that's a good point.|ba
fe016|right?|d
me011|right it can't be the internal one.|na
fe016|otherwise they're not allowed to play it for anyone.|s
me013|although it's|s
fe008|there we go.|s
fe008|oh i like that.|ba
me011|that's right.|aa
fe008|well put well put.|ba
fe008|so after the transcript screening phase.|cs
me011|yeah that's true.|aa
fe008|things have been weeded out.|s
fe016|otherwise we'd need two lawyer stages.|na
fe008|yeah that's right say yeah well i got this c d and your honor i|j
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|that's a good point.|ba
me013|yeah so that's so let's start with haas and yeah.|co
fe016|sorry to have to sorry i have to leave.|fa
fe016|i will be here full time next week.|s
me013|oh that's fine.|bk
me011|okay see you.|bk
me013|okay.|b
me011|no.|ar
me011|bye.|bk
me013|that's all right.|t3
me018|see you.|bk
me013|okay.|s
mn005|see you.|bk
me013|so uh let's see.|fg
me013|so that was that topic.|tc
me013|and then um i guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question.|fh
me013|for|%--
me011|we are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough room to record meetings.|s
me011|so i uh did a bunch of archiving and still doing a bunch of archiving.|s
me011|i i'm in the midst of doing the p files from uh broadcast news.|rt
me011|and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it.|rt
mn005|eleven?|%
me011|and it'll take another eleven to do the clone.|s
me018|where did you copy it to?|qw
me011|well it's abbott.|s
me011|it's abbott so it just but it's it's a lot of data.|s
me013|it's copying from one place on abbott to another place on abbott?|d
me011|tape.|nd
mn005|tape?|%
me011|i did an archive.|s
me013|oh!|fe
me013|i'm sorry.|fa
me018|oh on the tape.|bk
mn005|oh.|b
me018|uh.|b
me011|so i'm archiving it and then i'm going to delete the files.|cc
me011|so that will give us ten gigabytes of free space.|s
mn005|eleven hours?|%
me018|wow!|fe
mn005|oh.|b
fe008|yeah the archiving program does take a long time.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|and and|s
me011|yep.|aa
me011|and so that that will be done like in about two hours.|s
me011|and so uh at that point we'll be able to record five more meetings.|fh
me011|so|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|one thing the good news about that that is that once once it's archived it's pretty quick to get back.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|i mean it it it the other direction is fast but this direction is really slow.|s
me013|is it?|bu
me011|right.|bk
me013|huh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|well especially because i'm generating a clone also.|s
fe008|yeah okay.|bk
me011|so and that takes a while.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|generating a clone?|bu
fe008|yeah that's a good point.|ba
me011|two copies.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|one offsite one onsite.|s
me018|oh.|bk
me018|oh.|bk
me018|huh.|b
fe008|now what will uh is the plan to to so stuff will be saved it's just that you're relocating it?|d
fe008|i mean so we're going to get more disk space?|d
fe008|or did i|qrr
me011|no the the these are the p files from broadcast news which are regeneratable regeneratable.|ar
fe008|okay.|b
fe008|oh good.|ba
fe008|i see.|bk
me011|um if we really need to but we had a lot of them and for the full uh hundred forty hour sets.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me011|and so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something.|s
fe008|wow!|fe
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|wow!|fe
me013|we are getting more space.|s
me013|we are getting uh another disk rack and and four thirty six gigabyte disks.|e
me013|uh so uh but that's not going to happen instantaneously.|fh
fe008|wonderful.|ba
me011|or maybe six.|cs
me013|or maybe six?|bu
me011|the sun uh takes more disks than the andatico one did.|s
me013|how many?|rt
me011|the sun rack takes one took four and one took six or maybe it was eight and twelve whatever it was it was you know fifty per cent more.|s
me013|how much|qw
me018|is there a difference in price or something?|rt
me011|well what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from andatico for years according to dave.|s
me011|and andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices.|s
me018|oh!|fe
mn005|oh.|b
me011|and so uh we're looking into other vendors.|s
me011|we by we of course i mean dave.|s
fe008|wow.|b
me011|so|fh
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|huh i've been looking at the uh aurora data and um first first look at it there were basically three directories on there that could be moved.|s
me018|one was called aurora one was spanish which was carmen's spanish stuff and the other one was um spine.|s
me011|spine.|2
me018|and so um i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that the spine stuff was moving to a non backed up disk.|fh
me018|so um i realized that well probably not all of that should be moved just the c d rom type data the the static data.|fh
me018|so i moved that and then um i asked him to check out and see if it was okay.|s
me018|before i actually deleted the old stuff um but i haven't heard back yet.|s
me018|i told him he could delete it if he wanted to i haven't checked today to see if he's deleted it or not.|s
me018|and then carmen's stuff i realized that when i had copied all of her stuff to x a i had copied stuff there that was dynamic data.|s
me018|and so i had to redo that one and just copy over the static data.|s
me018|and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk.|s
me018|and then i haven't done any of the aurora stuff.|s
me018|i have to meet with uh stephane to do that.|s
me018|so|fh
me013|so but uh you're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the broadcast news.|s
me013|but we have some other disks some of which you're using for aurora.|s
me013|but are we do we have some other other space now?|qy
me011|yep.|aa
me011|so so uh we have space on the current disk right now where meeting recorder is.|fg
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and that's probably enough for about four meetings.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|is that the one that has is that d c?|rt
me011|so|fh
me011|yep.|aa
me011|no no.|ar
me011|well it's wherever the meeting recorder currently is.|s
me011|i think it's d i.|s
me018|okay.|bk
me018|i but the stuff i'm moving from aurora is on the d c disk that we|s
me011|i don't remember.|s
me011|i think it's d it's whatever that one is.|s
me018|okay d c.|s
me011|i just don't remember it might be d c.|am
me018|yeah.|b
me011|and that has enough for about four more meetings right now.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|yeah i mean we were at a hundred per cent and then we dropped down to eighty six for reasons i don't understand.|s
me011|um someone deleted something somewhere.|fh
me011|and so we have some room again.|s
me011|and then with broadcast news that's five or six more meetings.|s
me011|so you know we have a couple weeks.|s
me011|uh so yeah i think i think we're okay until we get the new disk.|fh
mn005|okay.|b
me018|so should um one question i had for you was um we need we probably should move the aurora and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk.|cs
me018|is there another backed up disk that you know of that would|qy
me011|we should put it onto the broadcast news one.|s
me011|that's probably the best thing to do and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out.|s
me018|okay.|bk
me018|right.|bk
me018|right.|bk
me018|do you know what happen to know what disk that is off?|qy
me011|no.|ar
me018|okay.|bk
me011|i mean i can tell you i just don't know off the top of my head.|no
me018|yeah.|b
me018|okay.|b
me018|all right i'll find out from you.|cc
me011|but so we could just do that at the end of today once the archive is complete and i've verified it.|cs
me018|okay.|bk
me011|because that'll give us plenty of disk.|s
me013|uh okay so uh then i guess the last thing i'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what jose has been doing.|fg
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|so|fh
mn005|okay.|h
mn005|i have uh the result of my work during the last days.|s
me013|okay.|b
mn005|thank you for your information because i i read uh and the the last uh days uh i work uh in my house uh in a lot of ways and thinking reading uh different things about the the meeting recording project.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and i have uh some ideas.|s
mn005|uh this information is very very useful.|s
fe008|i'm glad to hear it glad to hear it.|ba
mn005|you have the the the distribution now.|s
mn005|but for me uh is interesting because uh uh here's is the demonstration of the overlap uh problem.|s
me011|i've seen it already.|t3
mn005|it's a real problem a frequently problem uh because you have overlapping zones uh uh uh all the time.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|throughout the meeting.|na
mn005|uh by a moment i have uh nnn the uh i i did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording.|s
mn005|with uh a exact mark.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me011|oh you did that by hand?|bu
mn005|that's uh yet yeah by by hand by hand because uh uh why.|na
me011|can i see that?|rt
me011|can i get a copy?|qy
me013|oh.|b
mn005|my my idea is to work|s
mn005|i i i i i don't i don't know uh if uh it will be possible because i i i haven't a lot uh enough time to to to work uh only just uh six months as you know.|s
me018|wow!|fe
mn005|but uh my idea is uh is very interesting to to work in in the line of uh automatic segmenter.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh but uh uh in my opinion we need uh uh a reference uh session to to to evaluate the the the tool.|s
me011|yes absolutely.|aa
me011|and so are you planning to do that or have you done that already?|qr
mn005|and no no with|ar
mn005|sorry?|br
me011|have you done that or are you planning to do that?|qr
mn005|no i i plan to do that.|s
me011|okay.|bk
me011|darn!|fe
mn005|i plan i plan but uh uh the idea is the is the following.|s
mn005|now uh i need um to detect uh all the overlapping zones exactly.|s
mn005|i i will i will uh talk about uh in the in the blackboard about the my ideas.|cc
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|duration.|2
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh um uh this information uh with uh exactly time marks uh for the overlapping zones uh overlapping zone and uh a speaker a a pure speech uh uh speaker zone.|fh
mn005|i mean uh zones uh of uh speech of uh one speaker without any any uh noise uh any any acoustic event uh that uh uh uh is not uh speech real speech.|s
mn005|and i need true uh silence.|fh
mn005|for that because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters uh what uh are more more discriminant to uh classify.|cc
me011|right.|b
mn005|the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech uh zones.|s
mn005|the idea is to uh to use uh i'm not sure to uh yet but uh my idea is to use a a cluster uh algorithm or nnn a person strong in neural net algorithm to uh to uh study.|s
mn005|what is the uh the property of the different uh feature uh to classify uh speech and overlapping uh speech.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn005|and my idea is uh it would be interesting to to have uh a control set.|s
mn005|and my control set uh will be the uh silence silence without uh any any noise.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|which means that we'd still you'd hear the|s
fe008|yeah that's interesting.|ba
mn005|yeah acoustic with this with with yeah the background.|na
me011|yeah fans.|na
fe008|this is like a ground level with it's it's not total silence.|s
mn005|uh i i mean uh noise uh uh claps uh tape clips uh the difference uh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh uh event uh which uh uh has uh uh a hard effect of spectral distortion in the in the uh speech.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|so so you intend to hand mark those and exclude them?|d
mn005|yeah i have in in in in that not in all in all the the file.|s
me011|uhhuh.|bk
mn005|only uh uh nnn huh i have uh um i don't remind what is the the the the quantity.|s
mn005|but uh i i have marked enough speech on and all the overlapping zones.|s
mn005|i have uh two hundred and thirty more or less overlapping zones and is similar to to this information.|s
me011|whew!|fe
fe008|great great.|ba
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|because with the program i cross the information of uh of jane with uh my my segmentation by hand.|df
mn005|and is uh more similar.|s
fe008|excellent.|ba
fe008|glad to hear it.|ba
fe008|good.|ba
mn005|but|fh
mn005|sorry sorry.|fa
me013|go ahead.|s
mn005|and the the idea is uh i i will use uh i want my idea is uh to uh to classify.|s
me011|i should've got the digital camera.|t3
me011|oh well.|t3
mn005|i i need uh the exact uh mark of the different uh uh zones.|s
mn005|because i i want to put uh for uh each frame a label indicating it's a supervised and uh hierarchical clustering process.|df
mn005|i i i put uh uh for each frame a label indicating what is the type what is the class uh which it belong.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh i mean the class you will overlapping speech overlapping is a class uh speech the class that's|s
me011|non speech.|t1
me018|these will be assigned by hand?|d
mn005|i i i i i i put the mark by hand.|na
me018|based on the|qy
me018|uhhuh.|bk
mn005|because uh my idea is uh in in the first session i need uh i i need uh to be sure that the information uh that uh i i will cluster is is right because uh uh if not uh i will i will uh return to the speech file to analyze uh what is the problems.|s
me011|well training and validation sure.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh and i i'd prefer i would prefer to to have uh this labeled automatically.|s
mn005|but uh uh i need truth.|na
me018|you need truth huh.|2
me011|yeah but this is what you're starting with.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|i've got to ask you so uh the difference between the top two|s
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|bk
fe008|so so i start at the bottom so silence is clear.|s
fe008|by speech do you mean speech by one by one person only?|rt
mn005|speech|s
fe008|so this is okay and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time or or a speaker and a breath overlapping someone else's breath or or clicking overlapping with speech so that that's all those possibilities in the top one.|s
mn005|yeah.|aa
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|is|%--
me011|one two or more.|na
mn005|one two three.|s
mn005|but|%--
mn005|no by by the moment yeah yeah yeah.|aa
mn005|yeah.|aa
mn005|yeah.|aa
fe008|okay.|bk
mn005|uh in the first moment because uh uh i i have information uh of the overlapping zones uh information about if the uh overlapping zone is uh from a speech clear speech from a one to a two uh speaker or three speaker or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker uh overlaps uh onto uh a speech another especially speech.|s
fe008|so it's it's basically speech with with something overlapping which could be speech but doesn't need to be.|bu
mn005|no no especially uh overlapping speech from uh different uh uh speaker.|ar
me013|no but there's but i think she's saying where do you in these three categories where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech?|ng
mn005|uh.|b
mn005|uh!|b
me013|which category do you put that in?|qw
fe008|yeah that's right that's my question.|na
mn005|yeah.|h
mn005|yeah here i i put uh speech from uh from uh one speaker without uh uh any any any events more.|s
fe008|oh!|fe
me013|right so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a non speech event at the same time?|bk
me013|which which category?|qw
fe008|like a|s
mn005|where where what is the class?|qw
mn005|no by the moment no.|ar
fe008|oh.|b
me011|yeah yeah that's what he was saying before.|s
fe008|so you don't it's not in that|s
me013|oh so you not not marked.|bu
mn005|for for the by the no because i i i i want to limit the the nnn the the study.|df
me013|okay.|b
me013|got it.|bk
me013|fine so so|bk
me011|yeah so that's what he was saying before is that he excluded those.|s
me018|so you're not using all of the data.|bu
mn005|the all i exactly.|aa
me011|yeah.|aa
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah you mean.|s
fe008|so you're ignoring overlapping events unless they're speech with speech.|bu
mn005|yeah|aa
me013|yeah that's fine.|aa
mn005|yeah.|aa
fe008|okay.|b
mn005|why?|qw
mn005|why?|qw
mn005|what's the reason?|qw
mn005|because it's the first study.|s
me013|oh no no it's a perfectly sensible way to go.|fg
mn005|the first|s
fe008|we're|s
me013|we just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing.|df
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah because you've talked about other overlapping events in the past.|s
me013|okay.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|so this is this is a subset.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|in the in the future the the idea is to to extend the class.|s
me018|is is|qy
mn005|to consider all the all the information you you mentioned before.|s
me013|yeah yeah i i don't think we were asking for that.|fg
fe008|okay|%--
me013|we were just trying to understand.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
mn005|but uh the the first idea because uh i don't know what what will happen with the study.|df
fe008|yeah we just wanted to know what the category was here.|na
me013|yeah.|b
me011|right.|b
me013|sure.|b
mn005|yeah.|fh
me018|is your silence category pure silence or|qr
me018|what if there was a door slam or something?|qw
mn005|it's pure|na
mn005|no no it's pure silence.|ar
me018|pure silence.|bk
mn005|it's the control set.|s
me018|okay.|bk
mn005|okay.|b
mn005|it's the control set.|r
me013|what you|s
mn005|it's pure pure silence with the with the machine on the on the roof.|nd
me013|well|fg
me013|i i think what you i think what you mean is that it's non speech segments that don't have impulsive noises.|bu
me011|with the fan.|2
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right?|d
me013|because you're calling what you're calling event is somebody coughing or clicking or rustling paper or hitting something which are impulsive noises.|bs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but steady state noises are part of the background.|ng
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|which are being included in that.|bu
me013|right?|d
mn005|here yet yet i i i i i think i i think uh there are that some kind of noises that uh don't don't wanted to to be in that uh in that control set.|arp
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|so it's like a signal noise situation.|bs
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|well|nd
me013|yeah.|bk
mn005|but i prefer i prefer at at the first uh the the silence with uh this uh this kind of the of uh of noise.|df
fe008|well steady state.|t1
me013|right it's i mean it's background might be might be a better word than silence.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|it's just sort of that the the background acoustic.|df
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|right so fine go on.|bk
mn005|is is is only|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|okay.|bk
fe008|well we needed to get the categories yeah.|s
mn005|and um with this information the idea is uh uh nnn i have a label for for each uh frame and uh with a cluster uh algorithm i and|s
mn005|sorry.|fa
mn005|and uh i am going to prepare a test bed uh well uh a a set of feature structure uh uh models.|cc
me011|right.|bk
mn005|and my idea is|s
me011|tone whatever.|s
mn005|so so on because i have a pitch extractor yet.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i have to to test but uh i|s
me018|you have your own?|bu
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|aa
me018|oh!|fe
mn005|i i have prepare.|s
mn005|is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker uh from uh uh stanford university.|e
mn005|in stanford?|bu
mn005|no.|ar
mn005|from uh them cambridge university.|e
me018|oh!|fe
me018|what's it written in?|qw
mn005|uh them i i i don't remember what is the the name of the of the author.|no
mn005|because i i have several i have uh uh them uh library tools from uh festival and of from edinburgh uh from cambridge uh and from our department.|df
me018|uh.|b
me013|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
mn005|and and i have to because in general the pitch tracker doesn't work very well and|df
me011|bad.|2
me011|right.|bk
me011|but you know as a feature it might be okay.|arp
mn005|yeah yeah.|aa
me011|so we don't know.|s
mn005|this this is and the idea is to to uh to obtain uh for example uh uh uh uh different well no a great number of uh f e c for example uh uh twenty five uh thirty thirty parameters uh for for each one.|s
mn005|and in a first uh nnn step in the in the research uh my idea is try to uh to prove what is the performance of the difference parameter uh to classify the different uh what is the the the the front end approach to classify uh the different uh frames of each class uh and what is the the nnn nnn nnn uh what is the the error uh of the data.|s
me011|supervised clustering.|t3
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|this is the the uh first idea.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and the second is try to uh to use some ideas uh similar to the linear discriminant analysis.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh|%
mn005|uh similar because the idea is to to study what is the contribution of uh each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me011|what sort of classifier|qw
mn005|uh the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is uh is uh similar nnn that the classifier used uh in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is uh used to to uh some distance to to put uh a vector uh in in a class different.|s
mn005|is yeah with a model is is only to cluster using a uh or a similarity.|s
me011|unimodal?|d
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|so is it just one cluster per|e
mn005|another possibility it to use uh a a neural network.|s
me011|right.|bk
mn005|but uh what's the what is my idea?|qw
mn005|what's the problem i i i i see in in in if you you use the the neural network?|qw
mn005|if when this kind of uh huh cluster clustering algorithm to can test to can uh observe what happened you you can't you can't uh uh put up with your hand in the different parameter.|s
me011|right you can't analyze it.|aa
mn005|but uh if you use a neural net is is a good idea but uh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net.|s
me013|well actually you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different pieces of the input are.|nd
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|it's hard to what you it's hard to tell on a neural net is what's going on internally.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but it's actually not that hard to analyze it and figure out the effects of different inputs especially if they're all normalized.|nd
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um but|fh
me011|well using something simpler first i think is probably fine.|s
me013|well this isn't if if if you really wonder what different if if|nd
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|but|%--
me011|decision tree.|cs
me013|yeah then a decision tree is really good.|na
me013|but the thing is here he's he's not he's not like he has one you know a bunch of very distinct variables like pitch and this he's talking about like all these cepstral coefficients and so forth.|s
me011|right.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|right.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|in which case any reasonable classifier is going to be a mess and it's going to be hard to figure out what what uh|s
mn005|and|%--
me011|right.|b
mn005|i i i will include too the the the differential derivates too.|cc
me013|yeah.|b
me011|deltas.|s
me011|yeah so.|fh
me013|i i mean i think the other thing that one i mean this is i think a good thing to do to sort of look at these things at least|s
me013|see what i'd i'd let me tell you what i would do.|s
me013|i would take just a few features instead of taking all the m f c c's or all the p l p's or whatever i would just take a couple.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|fh
me013|like like c one c two something like that so that you can visualize it.|cs
me013|and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|okay so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers just take a look in two dimensions at how these things are split apart.|cs
me013|that i think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and the second thing is once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers what this lacks so far is the temporal properties.|s
me013|so if you're just looking at a frame and a time you don't know anything about you know the structure of it over time and so you may want to build build a markov model of some sort uh or or else have features that really are based on um on on some bigger chunk of time.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but i think this is a good place to start.|s
me013|but don't anyway this is my suggestion is don't just you know throw in twenty features at it the deltas and the delta and all that into some classifier even even if it's k nearest neighbors you still won't know what it's doing even you know it's not a neural net.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me013|uh i think to know what it's to have a better feeling for what it's doing you want to look at it.|cs
me013|so you want to look at at some picture that shows you here's these things uh uh are offer some separation.|cs
me011|yep.|b
me013|and uh in l p c uh the thing to particularly look at is i think is something like uh the residual the energy in the residual.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um so.|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|can i ask?|cs
fe008|it strikes me that there's another piece of information um that might be useful and that's simply the transition.|s
fe008|so if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech there's going to be a a big informative area there it seems to me.|s
mn005|yeah because|%--
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah i yeah but uh i i is my my own vision of the of the project.|s
me011|so some sort of|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i uh the the meeting recorder project for me has uh two uh has uh several parts several objective.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh because it's a a great project.|s
mn005|but uh at the first in the acoustic uh uh parts of the project uh i think you uh we have uh two main uh objective.|s
mn005|one one of these is to uh to detect the change the acoustic change.|s
mn005|and for that if you don't use uh uh a speech recognizer uh broad class or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames i think the ike criterion or bic criterion uh will be enough to detect the change.|fh
mn005|and probably i i i i would like to to prove.|s
mn005|uh probably when you you have uh uh uh the transition of speech or or silence uh to overlap zone this criterion is enough with probably with uh this kind of uh uh the the the more uh use uh use uh used uh them normal regular uh parameter m m f c c.|s
mn005|you you have to to to find you can find the the mark.|s
mn005|you can find the nnn the the acoustic change.|s
mn005|but uh uh i i understand that you your objective is to uh classify to know that uh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file that uh you have uh but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone.|s
mn005|because in the future you will uh try to to process that zone with a regular uh uh speech recognizer model i suppose.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping uh zone with another kind of algorithm.|s
mn005|because it's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from uh using uh uh a regular normal speech recognizer.|df
mn005|that you know i i i think is the idea.|s
mn005|and so uh the nnn the the system uh will have two models.|s
mn005|a model to detect more the most accurately possible that is uh will be possible the uh the mark the change.|s
fe008|okay.|b
mn005|and another another model will or several models to try but uh several uh robust models sample models to try to classify the difference class.|s
me011|i'm i'm i'm sorry i didn't understand you what you said.|br
me011|what what model?|br
mn005|uh the the classifiers of of the to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize uh with uh to transcribe with uh a speech recognizer.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|so|%
mn005|and my idea is to use uh for example a neural net.|s
mn005|with the information we obtain from this uh this uh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to uh to put the class of each frame uh for the difference zone.|s
me011|features.|2
me011|yeah.|b
mn005|you you uh uh have obtained in the first uh step with the for example bic uh uh criterion compare model.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and you|%--
me013|okay but i i think in any event we're agreed that the first step is.|s
mn005|i don't|%
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|because what we had before for for uh speaker change detection did not include these overlaps.|df
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right?|d
me013|so again i think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh in in in in|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|features.|t1
me013|well i again the things you've written up there i think are way too way too big.|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|okay if you're talking about say twelfth twelfth order uh m f c c's or something like that it's just way too much.|nd
me013|you won't be able to look at it.|e
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|all you'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does.|ng
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|whereas i think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things or three of you have some very fancy display uh and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out you'll have much more insight about what's going on.|cs
mn005|it will be enough.|na
me013|well you'll you'll get a feeling for what's happening you know.|s
me013|so if you look at suppose you look at first and second order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first order is much more effective than the second and then you look at the third and there's not and not too much there you may just take first and second order cepstral coefficients.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right?|d
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and with l p c i think l p c per se isn't going to tell you much more than than than the other maybe.|s
me013|uh and uh on the other hand the l p c residual the energy in the l p c residual will say how well uh the low order l p c model's fitting it which should be pretty poorly for two or more people speaking at the same time and it should be pretty well for for for one.|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and so i again if you take a few of these things that are are um promising features and look at them in pairs uh i think you'll have much more of a sense of okay i now have uh doing a bunch of these analyses.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|i now have ten likely candidates.|cs
me013|and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|i've got a question.|s
fe008|interesting.|ba
fe008|huh.|b
mn005|sorry.|fa
mn005|but uh uh uh uh uh i don't know it is the first uh way to to do that.|s
mn005|and i would uh like to to know what uh your opinion.|s
mn005|uh all this study in the in the first moment i i i i will pretend to do with uh uh equalizes speech the the equalizes speech the speech uh the mixes of speech.|cc
me011|with|%--
fe008|with what?|br
fe008|with what?|br
me011|right mixed.|bk
mn005|the the mix mixed speech.|bk
fe008|mixed thank you.|bk
mn005|uh why?|qw
mn005|because uh the spectral distortion is more uh a lot uh clearer very much clearer if we compare with the p d a.|s
me011|right.|bk
mn005|p d a speech file is uh it will be uh difficult.|s
mn005|i|s
fe008|so it's messier.|bu
fe008|the the p d a is messier.|bu
mn005|yeah.|aa
mn005|because the the noise uh to the signal to noise relation is uh is is low.|e
me013|okay.|b
me011|yeah i think that that's a good way to start.|s
mn005|and i don't know.|fh
me011|but|%--
mn005|i don't know uh uh that uh the the result of the of the study uh with uh with uh this uh this speech the mix speech uh will work exactly with the uh p d a files.|s
me011|it would be interesting in itself to see.|s
mn005|uh what i i mean what is the effect of the low signal to to to noise relation you know uh with|qw
me011|well i think that would be an interesting result.|s
me013|well i think i think i think it's not a it's not at all unreasonable.|fg
me013|it makes sense to start with the simpler signal.|s
me013|because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal to noise ratio then there's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio one would think anyway.|df
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and so if you can get uh again my prescription would be that you would with a mixed signal you would take a collection of possible uh features look at them look at how these different classes that you've marked separate themselves and then collect uh in pairs and then collect ten of them or something and then proceed with a bigger classifier.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and then if you can get that to work well then you go to the other signal.|cs
me013|and then and you and you know they won't work as well but how you know how much.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|right.|b
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me013|and then you can re optimize and so on.|cs
me011|yeah but i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both.|cs
me011|because it i think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed and and don't.|cs
me013|huh.|b
mn005|uh yeah yeah yeah yeah.|aa
me013|that's well the it it's it's true that it also it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases sure.|na
mn005|but|%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i i i i think that the the uh parameter we found uh uh worked with both uh speech file.|s
fe008|that's good.|ba
mn005|but uh what is the the the relation of uh of the performance when uh you use uh the uh uh speech the p d a speech files?|qw
me013|huh.|b
mn005|yeah i don't know.|no
me013|right.|b
mn005|but it i i i i think it will be important.|s
mn005|because uh people uh uh different groups eh has uh experience with this uh kind of problem is uh is not easy uh to solve because if you|s
mn005|i i i have seen the the the speech file from uh p d a and some parts is very difficult.|s
mn005|because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram.|df
me011|right.|b
mn005|is very difficult to apply uh uh a parameter to detect change when you don't see.|s
me011|yeah they're totally hidden.|na
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|well that that that's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things things like harmonicity and residual energy are uh yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they'll be more reliable.|fg
mn005|but i suppose|s
me011|are probably better yep.|2
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|aa
mn005|i i i will put uh the energy here.|cc
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|aa
me013|chuck was going to ask something i guess.|s
mn005|you have a question?|d
me018|yeah i maybe this is a dumb question.|fg
me018|but i thought it would be i thought it would be easier if you used a p d a.|s
me013|nah.|ar
me018|because can't you couldn't you like use beam forming or something detect speaker overlaps?|rt
me018|i mean|s
me011|well if you used the array rather than the signal from just one.|aap
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah no you're you're right.|aa
me011|but that's|s
me013|that in fact if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones you do have some location information which we don't have with the one.|s
me013|and and so that's|s
me018|is that not allowed with this project?|bu
me013|uh well no i mean we don't have any rules really.|h
me018|but i didn't mean i given given the goal.|ng
me013|i think i i think i think it's it's it's a it's an additional interesting question.|s
me018|i mean is is that violation of the|qy
mn005|oh.|b
mn005|no.|ar
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|i mean i think you want to know whether you can do it with one.|s
me013|because you know it's not necessarily true that every device that you're trying to do this with will have two.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|uh if on the other hand we show that there's a huge advantage with two well then that could be a real point.|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but we don't even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is.|s
me013|you know maybe it doesn't matter too much.|s
me018|right.|aa
me018|right.|aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so this is all pretty early stages.|s
me018|okay.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but no you're absolutely right.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|i see.|bk
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|b
me013|that's a good thing to consider.|s
me018|okay.|bk
fe008|there there is a complication though and that is if a person turns their back to the to the p d a then some of the positional information goes away.|s
me013|well it it it does it it does but the the the issue is that that|ng
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|no it's not it's not that so much as|arp
fe008|and then and if they're on the access on the axis of it that was the other thing i was thinking.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|he you mentioned this last time that that if if you're straight down the midline then then the the left right's going to be different.|s
me011|yeah we need to put it on a little turntable.|cs
mn005|i i i i i|fg
me011|and|%--
me018|well|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|and and and in his case i mean he's closer to it anyway.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|it seems to me that that it's not a uh you know it's this the the topology of it is is a little bit complicated.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|but it's another source of information.|s
mn005|i i yeah.|b
me018|i don't i don't know|s
mn005|i i i think|s
mn005|sorry.|fa
mn005|i i i think because the distance between the two uh microphone uh in the p d a is very near.|s
mn005|but it's uh from my opinion it's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural uh problem uh with information because i i found difference between the the speech from from each uh in the p d a.|cs
me018|i would guess|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|yeah it's timing difference.|na
fe008|oh yeah oh i agree and we use it ourselves.|na
me013|it's not amplitude.|s
me013|right?|bu
me013|right.|aa
fe008|i mean i know i i know that's a very important cue.|s
me011|yep.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|but i'm just i'm just saying that the way we're seated around a table is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the p d a.|s
mn005|no.|ar
mn005|no.|ar
mn005|no no no.|ar
fe008|so we're going to have a lot of differences with respect to the speaker.|s
me013|that's that's fine.|aa
me018|but i don't think that matters though.|ng
mn005|but|%
me013|that's so so i think the issue is is there a clean signal coming from only one direction.|bs
me018|right.|b
me013|if it's not coming from just one direction if it if if there's a broader pattern it means that it's more likely there's multiple people speaking.|bs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|wherever they are.|s
me018|so it's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is.|bs
me013|is it a is it|qy
me013|yeah is there a narrow is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern?|qr
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so if there's a distributed beam pattern then it looks more like it's it's uh multiple people.|s
fe008|okay.|bk
me013|wherever you are even if he moves around.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|okay it just it just seemed to me that uh that this isn't the ideal type of separation.|fg
fe008|i mean i i think it's i can see the value|s
me013|oh ideal would be to have the wall filled with them.|s
me013|but i mean but the thing is just having two mikes if you looked at that thing on on dan's page it was when when there were two people speaking and it looked really really different.|s
fe008|yeah okay.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
fe008|oh yeah yeah okay.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|what looked different?|qw
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|uh well he was looking at correlation.|s
me011|cross cross correlation.|2
me013|just cross correlation between two sides.|na
mn005|correlation yeah.|bk
me013|so cross correlation is pretty sensitive.|s
me018|sorry uh i'm not sure what dan's page is that you mean he was looking at the two|fa
fe008|uh his a web page.|s
me013|you take the signal from the two microphones and you and you cross correlate them with different lags.|s
me011|subtract them.|2
me018|okay.|bk
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay.|fh
me013|so when one person is speaking then wherever they happen to be at the point when they're speaking then there's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the in in the lag.|s
me013|so if at whatever angle you are at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there you get this boost in the in in the cross correlation value function.|s
me018|okay okay.|bk
me018|so so if there's two|s
me011|and if there are multiple people talking you'll see two peaks.|s
me013|it's spread out.|s
fe008|well let me ask you if if both people were over there it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across catty corner.|bu
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|the oh i'm sorry.|fa
fe008|no?|d
me013|if they're right next to one another?|bu
me018|if i was if i was here and morgan was there and we were both talking it wouldn't work.|na
fe008|next next one over over on this side of the p d a.|s
fe008|there we go.|na
me011|right.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|good example the same one i'm asking.|ba
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah i see.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|versus you versus you know and we're catty corner across the table and i'm farther away from this one and you're farther away from that one.|s
me018|yes.|b
me011|or or even if like if people were sitting right across from each other you couldn't tell the difference either.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|it seems like that would be pretty strong.|s
me013|yeah oh yeah.|aa
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|across the same axis you don't have as much to differentiate.|s
fe008|and so my point was just that it's it's going to be differentially differentially valuable.|bs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|well we yeah we don't have a third dimension there yeah so it's|na
me011|right.|b
fe008|i mean it's not to say i mean i certainly think it's extremely and we we humans depend on you know these these binaural cues.|s
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me013|but it's almost but it's almost a i think what you're talking about there's two things.|s
fe008|but.|%
me013|there's a sensitivity issue and then there's a pathological error uh issue.|s
me013|so the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error.|s
fe008|yes yeah.|b
me013|if someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|okay.|fg
fe008|and and if there so it and if it's the two of you guys on the same side|s
me013|uh if they're if they're close it's just a question of the sensitivity.|s
me011|yep.|aa
fe008|yeah.|bk
fe008|okay.|bk
me013|so if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough uh experience with it to know how|s
fe008|yeah yeah okay yeah.|bk
me011|but|fg
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|oh i'm not i'm not trying to argue against using it by any means i just wanted to point out that that weakness that it's topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody.|df
me013|yeah.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|and i think dan is still working on it.|s
me011|so he actually he wrote me about it a little bit.|fh
me011|so|fh
fe008|great.|ba
fe008|no i don't mean to discourage that at all.|df
me013|i mean the other thing you can do uh if i mean we're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the p d a.|s
me013|but if you put a third in you could put in the other axis and then you know then you're sort of yeah then then you pretty much could cover|cs
me018|once you got two.|s
fe008|interesting.|ba
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|well what about just doing it from these mikes?|qw
fe008|interesting.|ba
me018|you know?|d
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
mn005|it will be more interesting to study the p z m because the the separation i i think.|s
me013|uh but that's i mean we we'll be all of this is there for us to study.|s
me011|then they're much broader.|ng
me011|yeah we can do whatever we want.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but but but the thing is uh one of the at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a p d a.|s
me011|whatever you're interested in.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|that's what i was asking about what are the constraints.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right yeah.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|well that's that's the constraint of one question that i think both adam and i were were were interested in.|s
me011|well|%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|yep.|aa
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but you know if you can instrument a room this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing right?|s
me013|some people at at uh yeah at brown and and and and at uh um and at cape.|na
me011|big micro arrays.|2
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|didn't they have something at cape?|rt
me013|they both have these you know big arrays on the wall.|s
me013|and you know if you could do that you've got microphones all over the place.|s
me011|very finely.|s
me013|uh you know tens of microphones.|e
me013|and and uh|fh
me018|oh i saw a demo!|fe
mn005|oh right oh yeah.|b
me013|and if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|oh i saw one that was like a hundred microphones a ten by ten array.|s
me013|yeah yeah.|b
mn005|hundred.|s
me018|and you could in a noisy room they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|and they had very precision|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|right.|aa
me013|pretty much yeah.|aa
mn005|very complex uh yeah.|na
me011|it was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it.|e
me013|yeah.|b
me018|that is cool.|ba
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|it was yeah it was interesting.|s
me013|but the reason why i haven't focused on that as the my first concern is because um i'm interested in what happens for people random people out in some random place where they're having an impromptu discussion.|fg
me013|and you can't just always go well let's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to to set up.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|no what you need to do is you'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall.|fg
me018|it has all these mikes and it has a plug in jack to the p d a.|cs
fe008|interesting.|ba
me013|the other thing actually that gets at this a little bit of something else i'd like to do is what happens if you have two p d a's?|qw
me011|but i think|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|and they communicate with each other and then you know they're in random positions the likelihood that i mean basically there wouldn't be any likely to be any kind of nulls if you even had two if you had three or four it's yeah.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|ooo!|fe
me011|that's on my web pages.|s
me011|yeah.|fh
me018|network.|cs
fe008|interesting.|ba
me011|though|%--
me011|all sorts of interesting things you can do with that.|cs
fe008|interesting.|ba
me011|i mean not only can you do microphone arrays but you can do all sorts of um multi band as well.|cs
fe008|huh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|uh!|b
me011|so it's it would be neat.|s
me018|i still like my rug on the wall idea so if anybody patents that then|j
me011|but|fg
me011|i think|fg
fe008|well you could have strips that you stick to your clothing.|cs
me011|in terms of|fg
me011|yeah.|b
me018|yeah!|aa
me018|hats.|cs
me011|in terms of the research research it's really it's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do.|s
me018|shirts.|cs
me011|so if if jose is interested in that that's great.|s
me011|but if if he's not that's great too.|s
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
me013|um i i i would actually kind of like us to wind it down see if we can still get to the end of the uh birthdays thing there.|fg
me011|catch some tea?|2
me011|um.|fg
me013|so|fh
me011|well i had a couple things that i did want to bring out.|nd
me013|okay.|b
me011|one is do we need to sign new these again?|rt
fe008|well it's slightly different so i i would say it would be a good idea.|na
fe008|because it it's slightly different.|s
me018|are they new?|rt
me011|yep.|aa
me018|oh.|bk
me013|oh this morning we didn't sign anything because we said that if anybody had signed it already we didn't have to.|s
me011|yeah i i should've checked with jane first but the the form has changed.|s
fe008|it's slightly different.|na
me013|uhoh.|fg
me011|so we may want to have everyone sign the new form.|co
mn005|okay.|bk
fe008|i had to make one|s
me011|um i had some things i wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff i'm doing.|fg
me011|but if we're in a hurry we can put that off.|cs
me011|um and then also anonymity how we want to anonymize the data.|fh
fe008|well should i i mean i have some results to present but i mean i guess we won't have time to do that this time.|s
me011|uh|fh
fe008|but it seems like um the anonymization is uh is also something that we might want to discuss in greater length.|cs
me013|um i mean what|fg
fe008|if if we're about to wind down i think what i would prefer is that we uh delay the anonymization thing till next week.|cs
fe008|and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps.|cc
me018|we still have to do this too right?|bu
me013|right.|aa
me018|digits?|cs
me013|right.|bk
me011|well we don't have to do digits.|nd
me013|well why don't we|s
me013|uh so okay it sounds like uh there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about.|fh
me013|why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them and then and then and then and then and then we|co
me011|okay go ahead jane.|co
fe008|i'd i'd prefer to have more time for my results.|nd
fe008|could i do that next week maybe?|cs
me013|okay.|bk
me013|oh yeah sure.|aa
fe008|okay that's what i'm asking.|df
me013|oh yeah yeah.|aa
fe008|and i think the anonymization if if you want to proceed with that now i just think that that's that's a discussion which also really deserves a a you know more that just a minute.|cs
me013|we could|s
fe008|i really do think that.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself.|s
fe008|you and i have discussed it previously.|s
fe008|and there are different ways that people approach it and i think we should|cs
me011|all right.|b
me011|we're we're we're getting enough data now that i'd sort of like to do it now before i get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it.|cs
fe008|well okay.|fg
me011|going and dealing with it.|s
fe008|it's just|%--
fe008|yeah okay i i'll give you the short version.|cc
fe008|but i do think it's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes.|nd
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|okay so the the short thing is um we have uh tape recording uh uh sorry digitized recordings.|h
fe008|those we won't be able to change.|s
fe008|if someone says hey roger so-and-so.|s
me011|right.|b
fe008|so that's going to stay that person's name.|s
me011|yep.|b
fe008|now in terms of like the transcript.|s
fe008|the question becomes what symbol are you going to put in there for everybody's name?|qw
fe008|and whether you're going to put it in the text where he says hey roger or are we going to put that person's anonymized name in instead?|qr
me011|no because then that would give you a mapping and you don't want to have a mapping.|ar
fe008|okay so first decision is we're going to anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned.|co
me011|no.|ar
me018|i don't|s
me011|because that would give you a mapping between the speaker's real name and the tag we're using and we don't want|df
fe008|i i don't think you understood what i what i said.|ng
me011|okay.|bk
fe008|so uh so in within the context of an utterance someone says so roger what do you think.|fh
fe008|okay.|fh
fe008|then uh it seems to me that well maybe i uh it seems to me that if you change the name the transcript's going to disagree with the audio and you won't be able to use that.|s
me011|we don't we want to we we want the transcript to be roger.|nd
me018|right you don't want to do that.|aa
me011|because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we're using for roger someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name and we want to avoid that.|df
me018|yeah.|b
fe008|okay well but then there's this issue of if we're going to use this for a discourse type of thing then and you know liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who's who's the addressee and all then to have roger be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was roger be frank that's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis.|fg
me011|oh.|bk
me011|ugh.|bk
me011|that's a good point.|ba
fe008|now if you want to you know i mean in some cases i i i know that susan ervin tripp in some of hers uh actually did do uh um a filter of the signal where the person's name was mentioned except.|s
fe008|and and i and i so i mean the question then becomes one level back.|s
fe008|um how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name?|qw
fe008|well on the one hand uh it's not a full identity.|fh
fe008|we're taking all these precautions um and they'll be taking precautions which are probably even the more important ones to they'll be reviewing the transcripts to see if there's something they don't like okay.|s
fe008|so maybe uh maybe that's enough protection.|s
fe008|on the other hand this is a small this is a small pool and people who say things about topic x who are researchers and well known in the field they'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name.|s
fe008|however taking one step further back they'd be identifiable anyway even if we changed all the names.|s
me011|right.|aa
fe008|so is it really um you know|qy
mn005|huh.|b
me011|ugh!|fe
fe008|now in terms of like so i i did some results which i'll report on next time which do mention individual speakers by name.|fh
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|now there the human subjects committee is very precise.|s
fe008|you don't want to mention subjects by name in published reports.|s
fe008|now it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication.|s
me013|yeah once you get to the publication you can certainly do that.|na
fe008|and someone who looked|s
me013|you can go you know uh z uh for instance.|e
fe008|yeah exactly.|aa
fe008|doesn't matter if|s
me013|uh um yeah i mean it doesn't i mean i'm not knowledgeable about this.|fh
fe008|that's the same thing you saw.|s
me013|but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone's first name in in the in the transcript.|na
me011|okay.|b
me013|uh i think you don't want to have their full name to be uh listed.|fh
fe008|yeah and and in the form that they sign it does say your first name may arise in the course of the meetings.|aa
me013|and so|%--
me011|yeah.|b
me018|well|fg
me013|yeah.|b
me013|so again the issue is if you're tracking discourse things you know if someone says uh uh frank said this and then you want to connect it to something later you've got to have this part where that's frank colon.|bu
fe008|or your name.|s
me011|yeah shoot!|fe
me013|right?|d
fe008|yeah and and you know even more uh immediate than that just being able to uh well it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who's speaking and who's speaking to whom because that can be important.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|you know you raised the point so-and-so it's be kind of nice to be able to know who you was.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|shoot!|fe
me011|i i'm thinking too much.|s
fe008|and and actually you remember furthermore you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know i was sort of avoiding mentioning people's names.|s
me013|yeah i was too yeah.|na
fe008|and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial.|s
fe008|well i mean if we're going to step in after the fact and change people's names in the transcript we've basically done something one step worse.|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|well i would i i don't want to change the names in the transcript.|nd
fe008|misleading.|s
me011|but that's because i'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse and so i think that's a really good point.|df
me013|yeah.|b
me011|you're right this is going to require more thought.|aa
me013|yeah.|b
me013|let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the uh what we're covering in the meeting.|cs
me013|uh i realize when you're doing this that uh i mean i didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about.|s
me013|uh and so uh and so i was proceeding somewhat at random frankly.|fh
me013|so i think what would be helpful would be uh and i'll i'll mention this to to liz and andreas too that um before the meeting if anybody could send me any any uh uh agenda items that they were interested in and i'll i'll take the role of organizing them uh into into the agenda.|cs
fe008|okay.|b
fe008|sure.|b
me013|but i'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda.|cs
me013|i've no desire to to make it up.|s
me013|but if if no one's told me things then i'm just proceeding from my my guesses and and uh and yeah i i'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean i'm just always asking jose what he's doing you know and and so it's there's uh there's obviously other things going on.|fa
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|oh it's not a problem not a problem yeah.|bk
fe008|i just i just couldn't do it in two minutes.|df
me011|how will we how would the person who's doing the transcript even know who they're talking about?|tc
me011|do you know what i'm saying?|f
me018|the person who's doing the transcript the i b m people?|bu
me011|yeah.|aa
me011|i mean so how is that information going to get labeled anyway?|qw
fe008|how do you mean who what they're who they're talking about?|bu
fe008|how do you mean?|r
me011|i mean so if i'm saying in a meeting oh and bob by the way wanted wanted to do so-and-so|s
me018|they're just going to write bob on it or do|s
me011|if you're doing|s
me011|yeah they're just going to write bob.|na
me011|and so if you're if you're doing discourse analysis|s
fe008|they won't be able to change it themselves.|s
me013|what how are they going to do any of this?|qw
fe008|well i i'm betting we're going to have huge chunks that are just totally untranscribable by them.|s
me011|yeah really.|aa
me013|i mean they're going to say speaker one or speaker two or i mean i i|bu
me011|well the current one they don't do speaker identity.|s
mn005|yeah i think|fg
me018|they can't do that.|nd
me011|because in naturally speaking or excuse me in via voice it's only one person.|s
me011|and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions.|s
me013|so it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words.|s
fe008|oh i think that my understanding from|fg
me011|yep.|aa
fe008|is it yen ching?|rt
fe008|is that how you pronounce her name?|qy
me013|uh yu ching yu ching yeah.|bc
fe008|oh uh yu ching?|bu
fe008|yu ching?|bu
me011|yu-ching.|bc
fe008|was that um they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed where they put speaker identifier down.|s
fe008|but you know they won't know these people .|s
fe008|so i think it's well they'll they'll adopt some convention.|s
fe008|but we haven't specified to them.|s
fe008|so they'll do something like speaker one speaker two is what.|s
fe008|i bet but i'm betting there'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers.|s
fe008|we'll have to review the transcripts in any case.|co
me013|and it and it may very well be i mean since they're not going to sit there and and and worry about uh it being the same speaker they may very well go the uh the the first the first time it changes to another speaker that'll be speaker two.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|and the next time it'll be speaker three even if it's actually speaker one.|s
fe008|you know|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|you know that would be a very practical solution on their part.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|and and but then we would need to label it.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|it's a good idea.|ba
fe008|and that's okay.|s
me011|yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close talking mikes.|s
mn005|yeah yeah i think|fg
fe008|yes i was thinking the the time values of when it changes.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so but i mean that doesn't this doesn't answer the the question.|ng
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but that|s
fe008|that'd be very efficient.|s
me011|the it's a good point which what do you do for discourse tracking.|s
mn005|because you don't know to know uh you don't need to know what what is the identification of the of the speakers you only uh want to know|s
me011|huh.|b
me011|for for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do.|aap
me013|well you do.|nd
mn005|uh for discourse yeah yeah yeah.|aa
me013|yeah.|aa
me013|if if if if someone says uh what what is jose doing and then jose says something you need to know that that was jose responding.|na
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh so.|fh
me011|ugh that's a problem.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not to make a point of not identifying people by name which then leads you to be more contextually explicit.|cs
me018|that would be hard.|ng
fe008|well people are very flexible you know i mean so when we did this last week i felt that you know now andreas may uh uh he he sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something and and because he missed something then he missed the the initial introduction of who we were talking about and was was unable to do the tracking.|df
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe008|but i felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name.|df
fe008|so people are really flexible.|bs
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|but you know like at the beginning of this meeting or you i think said you know or liz said something about um uh is mari going to use the equipment.|fg
fe008|yeah.|bk
me018|i mean how would you say that?|ng
me018|i mean you have to really think you know about what you're saying|df
me011|if you wanted to anonymize.|2
me013|is you know who up in you know where?|qy
me018|yeah yeah.|aa
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|right use the|s
me018|i think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names plus we'd have to tell everybody else.|s
me011|yeah darn!|fe
me011|i mean what i was going to say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names.|cs
mn005|yeah is|%--
fe008|well|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|but then again that kills your discourse analysis.|s
me018|right.|aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|aa
fe008|that's that's the issue.|na
me018|i i think the i think i don't know my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what's in the recordings you only anonymize to the extent you can the speakers have signed the forms and all.|cs
me011|well but that but that as i said that that that works great for the acoustics but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse.|aap
fe008|well.|%
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|why?|rt
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|because you don't have a map of who's talking versus their name that they're being referred to.|df
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|i thought we were going to get it labelled speaker one speaker two|df
me011|sure but then you have to know that jose is speaker one and|s
me018|why do you have to know his name?|qw
me013|okay so suppose someone says well i don't know if i really heard what uh what jose said.|fg
me018|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and then jose responds.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|and part of your learning about the dialogue is jose responding to it.|s
me013|but it doesn't say jose it says speaker five.|s
me018|okay.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so uh|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|oh i see you want to associated the word jose in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded.|bk
me013|right.|aa
me013|and so if we pass out the data to someone else and it says speaker five there we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker five is jose.|cs
me011|someone who's doing discourse would want to do that.|na
me013|and if were going to do that we might as well give them jose say it was jose.|cs
me011|and that violates our privacy.|ng
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|and that violates our privacy issue.|na
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|now i i think that we have these two phases in the in the data which is the one which is our use university of washington's use i b m s r i.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|and within that it may be that it's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet but always always in the publications we have to.|cs
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and i think also when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world we have to.|co
fe008|but i but i that's that's a long way from now and and it's a matter of between now and then of of deciding how.|s
me011|making some decisions.|2
fe008|it you know it may be that we'll need to do something like actually x out that part of the um the audio and just put in brackets speaker one.|cs
me011|yeah.|b
me011|for the public one.|2
fe008|you know?|d
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|you know what we could do also is have more than one version of release.|cs
me011|one that's public and one one that requires licensing.|cs
me011|and so the licensed one would we could it would be a sticky limitation.|cs
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|you know like|s
fe008|i think that's risky i think that the public should be the same.|nd
me011|well we can talk about that later.|cs
fe008|i think that when we do that world release it should be the same.|cs
me013|i i agree.|aa
me013|i i agree with jane.|aa
fe008|for a bunch of reasons legal.|s
me013|i i think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort and|cs
fe008|but i also think a consistent licensing policy is important.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|well one thing to take into consideration is are there any um for example the people who are funding this work they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse.|cs
me018|if we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it's not longer useful for discourse.|s
me018|you know?|d
me011|well depending on how much editing we do you might be able to still have it useful.|arp
me011|because for discourse you don't need the audio.|e
me011|right?|d
me011|so you could bleep out the names in the audio.|cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|and use the anonymized one through the transcript.|cs
fe008|excuse me we we do need audio for discourse.|nd
me013|uh.|b
me018|but if you release both|s
me011|but excuse me but you could bleep out just the names.|aap
me013|no but she's saying from the argument before she wants to be able to say if someone said jose in their in their thing and then connect to to what he said later then you need it.|bs
me011|right.|bk
me011|but in the transcript you could say everywhere they said jose that you could replace it with speaker seven.|cs
me013|oh i see.|bk
fe008|yeah but i i also want to say that people|bk
me013|i see.|bk
me011|and then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|but it would be still useful for the|s
me018|but if both of those are publically available|s
fe008|yeah that's good.|ba
me011|but they|s
me011|right.|bk
me013|and and the other thing is if if if liz were here what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue.|s
fe008|well you see so it's complicated.|s
me013|and so uh|fh
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|b
fe008|i think we have to think about how i think that this can't be decided today.|s
me013|yeah sorry.|bk
me011|yeah okay good point.|ba
fe008|but it's but i think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time.|cs
me013|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me011|i didn't think when i wrote you that email i wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms but i guess it is.|s
mn005|okay.|b
me013|yeah a lot of these things are.|na
me011|discourse.|s
fe008|well it discourse you know also i wanted to make the point that that discourse is going to be more than just looking at a transcript.|s
me011|yeah absolutely.|b
fe008|it's going to be looking at a you know and prosodic stuff is involved.|s
me011|oh yeah sure.|b
fe008|and that means you're going to be listening to the audio.|s
fe008|and then you come directly into this confronting this problem.|s
me018|maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse.|cs
fe008|so|fh
me018|and then we wouldn't have to worry about it.|j
mn005|okay.|b
fe008|yeah we should just market it to non english speaking countries.|cs
me013|uh maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name.|cs
mn005|okay.|b
me011|did you read the paper on eurospeech?|qy
fe008|we could have little labels.|cs
fe008|i i i want to introduce my reservoir dogs solution again which is everyone has like mister white mister pink mister blue.|cs
me018|mister white.|cs
me011|yeah.|b
me011|did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables?|qy
me011|they were they had the utterances.|s
me011|and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards.|s
me018|but so the syllables were in the same order with respect to each other but the|bu
me011|everything was in the same order but they were the individual syllables were played backwards.|na
me011|and you could listen to it and it would sound the same.|s
me018|what did it sound like?|qw
me011|people had no difficulty interpreting it.|s
me011|so what we need is something that's the reverse that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it.|cs
me013|oh well that's there's an easy way to do that.|j
me013|just play it all backwards.|cs
me011|oh right the speech recognizer's totally symmetric isn't it.|bk
me013|what what does the speech recognizer care?|j
me011|uh anyway.|fg
me013|um|fg
fe008|oh do we do digits or|bu
fe008|what do we do?|qw
me013|let's do digits.|co
me011|uh okay we'll quickly do digits.|na
fe008|or do we just quit?|bu
me013|yeah we we we already missed the party.|s
me013|so|fh
me011|okay.|bk
fe008|yeah.|b
