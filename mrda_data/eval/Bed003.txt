me012|nice.|z
fe004|okay.|z
mn015|to to handle.|z
fe004|is that good?|z
me012|right.|z
me012|yeah i've have never handled them.|z
me003|goats eat cans to my understanding.|z
fe004|did we need to do these things?|z
me003|tin cans.|z
me012|wow!|z
fe004|okay.|z
me003|could i hit hit f seven to do that?|z
me003|on the|z
me003|robert?|z
me003|oh the remote will do it.|z
fe004|okay.|z
me003|okay.|z
me003|because i'm already up there?|z
mn015|i'm in control here.|z
me003|you are in control.|z
me003|already?|z
fe004|wow we're all so high tech here!|z
fe004|yet another powerpoint presentation.|z
me003|i well it makes it easier to do powerpoint.|z
fe004|certainly does.|z
me003|so we were|z
me003|uh!|z
me012|johno where are you?|z
me003|okay.|b
me003|so let's see.|s^t1
me003|which one of these buttons will do this for me?|qw^t1
me003|aha!|s^fe
me003|okay.|b
me012|should you go back to the first one?|qy^rt
me003|do i want to go back to the first one?|qy^m^rt^t1
me012|well|%-
me003|okay.|s^aa
fe004|i'm sorry i|s^fa^t3.%-
me012|well i mean just to|s^bd.%-
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|introduce.|s^co
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me012|yeah um well the search for the middle layer.|s^bk|s
me012|it's basically uh talks about uh it just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were.|s
fe004|i can read!|s^fe^j
fe004|i'm kidding.|s^bd
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|you know because|s.%-
mn015|but if you really want to find out what it's about you have to click on the little light bulb.|s
me003|although i've i've never i don't know what the light bulb is for.|s^no
me003|i didn't install that into my powerpoint presentation.|s
mn015|it opens the assistant that tells you that the font type is too small.|s
me003|uh.|s^bk
mn015|do you want to try?|qy^rt
fe004|ach|%-
me003|i'd prefer not to.|s^nd
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|continue.|s^co
fe004|it's a needless good idea.|s
fe004|is that the idea?|qy^g
mn015|why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode?|qw
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|because i'm going to switch to the javabayes program.|s^rt
mn015|oh okay.|s^bk
mn015|of course.|s^bk
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|and then if i do that it'll mess everything up.|s
fe004|i was wondering.|s
me003|is that okay?|qy^rt
fe004|yeah it's okay.|s^aa
mn015|sure.|b
me012|can you maximize the window?|qy^rt
fe004|proceed.|s^co
me003|you want me to|qy^d.%--
me003|wait what do you want me to do?|qw^br
me012|can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't doesn't appear?|qy
mn015|no it's okay.|s^ar
mn015|it's it'll work.|s
me003|well i can do that.|s^aap
me003|but then i have to end the presentation in the middle so i can go back to open up javabayes.|s^ng
me012|okay fine.|s^bk
me003|here let's see if i can|s.%-
me012|all right.|s^bk
fe004|very nice.|s^ba
me003|is that better?|qy^rt
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|uh i'll also get rid of this click to add notes.|s^cc
me003|okay.|b
fe004|perfect.|s^ba
me003|so then the features we decided or we decided we were talked about.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^f^g
me003|uh the the prosody the discourse verb choice.|s
me003|you know we had a list of things like to go and to visit and what not.|s
me003|the landmark-iness of uh|s.%--
me003|i knew you'd like that.|s
fe004|nice coinage.|s^ba
me003|thank you.|s^ft
me003|uh of a of a building.|s
me003|whether the|s.%--
me003|and this we actually have a separate feature.|s
me003|but i decided to put it on the same line for space.|s
me003|nice walls which we can look up.|s
me003|because i mean if you're going to get real close to a building in the tango mode|s.%--
me003|right?|qy^d^f^g
me003|there's got to be a reason for it.|s
me003|and it's either because you're in route to something else or you want to look at the walls.|s
me003|the context which in this case we've limited to business person tourist or unknown.|s
me003|the time of day.|s
me003|and open to suggestions isn't actually a feature.|s
me003|it's we are open to suggestions.|s
fe004|right.|s^bk
fe004|can i just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh in this particular domain|qy.%--
fe004|you said be it could be on two different lines.|s^df
fe004|but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark-iness is correlated with|qy.%-
me012|no.|s^ar
me003|oh|%-
me012|we have a separate|s^nd.%-
me003|they're separate things.|s
fe004|their being nice|s.%-
me012|feature.|s^bsc
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|yeah.|b
me003|i either could put nice walls on its own line or open to suggestions off the slide.|s
fe004|and and|%-
me012|like you could have a|s.%-
fe004|by nice you mean|qy^d.%-
me012|you like you could have a post office with uh you know nice murals or something.|s
me003|right.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|or one time i was at this|s.%-
fe004|so nice walls is a stand in for like architecturally it uh significant.|s^bu
me012|architecturally appealing from the outside.|s^na
fe004|or something like that.|s
me003|but see the thing is if it's|s^nd.%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|yeah but if it's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from|fg|s^ng.%--
me003|like you might be able to vista it.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^g
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|and be able to|s.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|appreciate it.|s^2
me003|yeah.|s^aa
me003|versus like|s.%--
me003|i was at this place in europe where they had little carvings of like dead people on the walls or something.|s^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|i don't remember|s^no.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|it was a long time ago.|s
fe004|there's a lot of those.|s
me003|but if you looked at it real close you could see the the intricacy of the of the walls.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so that count as counts as a nice wall.|s^bu
me003|right.|s^aa
fe004|the|%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|right.|b
fe004|something you want to inspect at close range because it's interesting.|s^bu
mn015|the|%-
me003|exactly.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|huh.|b
me003|robert?|qy^d
mn015|well there there is a term that's often used.|s
mn015|that's saliency or the salience of an object.|s^rt
mn015|and i was just wondering whether that's the same as what you describe as landmark-iness.|s
mn015|but it's really not.|s
mn015|i mean an object can be very salient.|s
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|but not a landmark at all.|s^2
fe004|not a landmark at all.|s^m
fe004|there's landmark for um touristic reasons and landmark for|s.%--
fe004|i don't know.|s^no
fe004|navigational reasons or something.|s
me003|right.|b
mn015|yep.|b
me012|yeah.|b
me012|we meant uh touristic reasons.|s
me003|yeah.|b
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|huh.|b
me003|right.|b
fe004|okay.|b
fe004|but you can imagine maybe wanting the both kinds of things there for different um goals.|s^bu
mn015|huh.|b
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
me003|right.|s^aa
me003|but|s^arp.%--
me003|yeah.|b
me003|touristy landmarks also happen to be|s.%--
me003|wouldn't couldn't they also be|qy.%--
me003|they're not exclusive groups.|s^bu
me003|are they?|qy^g
me003|like non tourist y landmarks and|s.%--
mn015|or it can be|s.%-
fe004|they're not mutually exclusive?|qy^m^rt
me003|direct navigational|s.%-
me003|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|right.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
fe004|right.|s^aa
fe004|definitely.|s^aa
me003|okay so our initial idea was not very satisfying because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node.|fg|s
me003|uh|fh
fe004|so a big flat structure.|s^bu
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
me003|right.|s^aa
me012|yep.|s^aa
me003|and uh so we|s.%--
me003|reasons being you know it'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that.|s
me003|if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort uh according bhaskara we'd be handicapped.|s
me003|i don't know belief nets very well.|s^no
me012|well usually i mean you know n|s.%--
me012|if you have n features then it's two to the n or exponential in n.|s
me003|and they wouldn't look pretty.|s^2
me003|so|s.%--
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|they'd all be like pointing to the one node.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|uh|fh
me003|so then our next idea was to add a middle layer.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^f^g
me003|so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we've drawn from the communication of some like the someone|s.%--
me003|the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea.|s
me003|like i'm the the abstract idea being i am a tourist.|s
me003|i want to go to this place.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^f^g
me003|so we're going to set up features along the lines of where they want to go.|s
me003|and what they've said previously and whatnot.|s
me003|and then we have the means that they should use.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^f^g
me003|but the middle thing we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out like the concept of whether they're a tourist or whether they're running an errand or something like that.|s
me003|along those lines.|s
me003|or|s.%--
me003|yes we things we couldn't extract the from the data the hidden variables.|s^aa|s
me003|yes.|s^aa
me003|good.|s^ba
me003|so then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour running an errand or whether they were in a hurry.|s
me003|because we were thinking uh if they were in a hurry there'd be less likely to like or|s.%-
me012|want to do vista.|s^2
me012|right?|qy^d^g
me012|because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry.|s^df
me003|right.|s^aa
me003|or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a like a navigational point to go to another place.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|whether the destination was their final destination.|s
me003|whether the destination was closed.|s
me003|those are all|s.%--
me003|and then let's look at the belief net okay.|s^tc
me003|so that means that i should switch to the other program.|s^t1
me003|um right now it's still kind of in a toy version of it.|s
me003|because we didn't know the probabilities of or|s.%--
me003|well i'll talk about it when i get the picture up.|s
mn015|no one knows it.|s
me003|okay.|h
me003|so this right what we|s.%--
me003|let's see.|s^t1
me003|what happens if i maximize this?|qw^t1
me003|there we go.|s^t1
me003|but uh|s.%--
me003|so the mode basically has three different outputs.|s
me003|the probability whether the probability of a vista tango or enter|s.%--
me003|um the context we simplified.|h|s
me003|basically it's just the businessman the tourist unknown.|s
me003|verb used is actually personally amusing.|s
me003|mainly because it's it's just whether the verb is a tango verb an enter verb or a vista verb.|s
me012|yeah.|fg
me012|that one needs a lot of|s.%-
fe004|and are those mutually exclusive sets?|qy
me012|not at all.|s^ar
me012|that's that that needs a lot of work.|s^r
me003|no.|s^ar
fe004|right.|s^bk
fe004|got it.|s^bk
me012|but uh that would've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah.|b
me012|so we decided that for the purposes of this it'd be simpler to just have three verbs.|s^rt
fe004|simple.|s
me003|yeah.|b
fe004|stab at it.|s
fe004|yep.|b
me003|right.|b
me003|um|fg
me003|why don't you mention things about this bhaskara?|qh^cs
me003|that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now.|s
me012|okay so yeah so note the four nodes down there the sort of the things that are not directly extracted.|s^bk|s
me012|actually the five things.|s^bsc
me012|the closed is also not directly extracted i guess.|s
me012|from the uh|s.%-
me003|well it's|%-
fe004|from the utterance?|qy^2^bu^d^rt
me012|huh.|b
me012|actually no.|s^ar
me003|it's it sort of is.|s^nd
me012|wait.|s^co
me012|it is.|s^aa^bsc
me003|because it's because have the the time of day.|s^df
me012|okay closed sort of is.|s
me003|and the close|s.%--
me003|it just had the uh and what time it closed.|s
me012|right.|s^bk
me012|so|%-
me012|right.|fg
me012|but the other ones the final destination the whether they're doing business whether they're in a hurry and whether they're tourists.|s
me012|that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things.|s
fe004|inferred from the other ones?|qy^2^bu^d^rt
me012|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|b
me012|and the mode you know depends on all those things only.|s
me003|yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here.|s
me012|yeah.|fg
me012|so we haven't uh managed|s.%--
me012|like we don't have nodes for discourse and parse.|s
me012|although like in some sense they are parts of this belief net.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|but uh the idea is that we just extract those features from them so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|right.|b
me012|because we'd never do inference on it anyway.|s
me012|so|fh
fe004|so some of the the top row of things|s.%--
fe004|what's what's disc admission fee?|qw
me012|whether they discuss the admission fees.|s
me012|so we looked at the data.|s
fe004|oh.|s^bk
me012|and in a lot of data people were saying things like can i get to this place.|s:qw
me012|what is the admission fee.|s:qw
me012|so that's like a huge uh clue that they're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|right.|b
fe004|okay.|b
me012|so|fg
fe004|i see.|s^bk
me003|there were there'd be other things besides just the admission fee.|s
me003|but you know we didn't have|s.%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|that was like our example.|s
me003|that was the initial one that we found.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic based um concept cues.|s^bu
me003|from the discourse that|s^2.%-
me003|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|for one of those.|s
fe004|and then in that second row or whatever that row of time of day through that so all of those some of them come from the utterance.|s^bu
fe004|and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things.|s^bu
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
fe004|so that you have no distinction between those and|s^bu.%-
me003|right.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|one uh uh um|fg
me003|anything else you want to say bhaskara?|qo^rt^tc
me012|um|h
fe004|unmark time of day?|qy.%
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|i i mean|s.%-
me003|one thing uh|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|fg
mn015|they're they're are a couple of more things.|s
mn015|i mean uh i would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all uh agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment.|s^cs
mn015|and maybe what changes we|s.%-
me003|yeah|s^aa.%-
me003|okay.|fg
me003|so one thing i i'm you know unsure about is how we have the uh the admission fee thing set up.|s
me003|so one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this|s.%--
me003|uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept.|s
me003|but you could see perhaps the admission fee going directly to the mode pointing at enter.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|right?|qy^d^f^g
me003|versus pointing just at tourist.|s^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me003|but we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|why is the landmark|qw^rt.%--
mn015|okay.|b
mn015|the landmark is facing to the tourists.|s
mn015|that's because we're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks.|s^bu
me003|right.|s^aa
mn015|not as possible um|s.%-
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|navigational landmarks.|s^bk^m
fe004|navigational cue.|s^2
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|navigational landmarks.|s^2
mn015|so|fh
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|then|s.%--
me003|that would be whatever building they referred to.|s
fe004|prosody.|s.%
me012|right.|b
me012|so let's see.|s^t1
me012|the variables.|s
me012|admission fee is a binary thing.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|time of day is like morning afternoon night.|s^bu^rt
me012|is that the deal?|qy^d^g^rt
me003|that's how we have it currently set up.|s^na
me012|yeah.|b
me003|but it could be you know based upon hour.|s
mn015|yep.|s^aa.%
me012|yeah.|b
me012|yeah.|b
me003|or we could discrete it descret-ize it.|s
mn015|whatever granularity.|s
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|yeah.|b
me012|yeah.|fg
me012|normally context will include a huge amount of information.|s
me012|but um we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they're a tourist or not i guess.|s^rt
mn015|yep.|b
fe004|okay.|fg
fe004|so that's given in their input.|s^bs
me003|right.|b
me012|so|fg
fe004|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|right.|s^aa
me012|so it's not really all of context.|s
me012|similarly prosody is not all of prosody.|s
me012|but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|that's very nice.|s^ba
mn015|huh?|qy^d^g
fe004|okay.|b
me012|and|%-
mn015|the the so the context is a switch between tourist or non tourist?|qy^rt
mn015|or also unknown?|qrr
me003|or unknown.|s^aap
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|okay.|s^bk
me012|unknown.|s^bk^m
fe004|so final|s.%--
me012|right?|qy^f^g^rt
fe004|so it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist.|s
me012|which is which one?|qw
fe004|but|s.%--
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so the the context being um|s.%--
fe004|i don't know if that question's sort of in general.|s^no
fe004|are you|qy.%--
fe004|i mean the|s.%--
fe004|are|qy.%--
fe004|do they allow business people to be doing non business things at the moment?|qy^rt
me012|yeah it does.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so then you just have some probabilities over|s.%--
me012|everything is probablistic.|s
me012|and there's always|s.%--
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|over which which of those it is.|s
me012|yeah.|b
me012|um right.|h|s^bk
me012|so then landmark is|s.%--
me012|oh!|s^fe
me012|sorry.|s^fa
me012|verb used is like|s.%--
me012|right now we only have three values.|s
me012|but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|rather|s.%--
me012|let me rephrase that.|s
me012|it it can take values in the set of all verbs that they could possibly use.|s^bsc^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|um nice walls is binary.|s
me012|closed is binary.|s
me012|final destination again|s.%--
me012|yeah all those are binary i guess.|s
me012|and mode is one of three things.|s
mn015|so the the middle layer is also binary?|qy^rt
mn015|no|s.%--
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node.|s
mn015|uh it|s.%--
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|but all those things without question marks are also binary.|s^bu
mn015|right?|qy^d^g
me012|which things?|qw
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|nice walls.|s^rt
me012|oh.|s^bk
me012|nice walls is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|yeah oh.|s^bk
me012|yeah sorry it is binary.|s^aa
me003|it is binary.|s^m
me012|that's true.|s^aa
me003|but it doesn't have question mark because it's extracted.|s^df
me012|yeah.|b
me012|okay i see your point.|s
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|okay.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|i i gotcha.|s^bk
me012|yeah similarly closed i guess.|s
mn015|so we can either be in a hurry or not.|s
mn015|but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment?|qy^rt
me012|well|s.%--
me012|to do that we would add another uh value for that.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|okay.|s^bk
me012|and that would require updating the probability distribution for mode as well.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account.|s^df
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|take a|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so um of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases.|fg|s^rt
mn015|yeah yeah.|b
fe004|but you can imagine that it's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you.|s
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|like it's a conjunction of|s.%--
fe004|i don't know.|s^no
fe004|you know the verb used and some other stuff that that would determine|s.%--
me012|right.|fg
me012|other syntactic information you mean?|qy^bu^rt
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|exactly.|s^aa
me012|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|um|h
mn015|well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object.|s^bu^rt
mn015|right?|qy^d^g
mn015|the argument in a sense?|qy^d^g^rt
fe004|usually.|s^aap
fe004|i i don't know if that's always the case.|s^no
fe004|i i guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have.|s
fe004|so um|fh
mn015|that's always warping on something some entity.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and um uh maybe at this stage we will we do want to uh sort of get uh modifiers in there.|s^cs
me003|huh yeah.|b
mn015|because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not.|s
me012|yeah.|fg
me003|i want to get to the church quickly.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|and uh|s.%-
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|right.|s^aa
fe004|that would be a cue.|s
mn015|what's the fastest way|s.%--:qw
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|correct.|b
fe004|um okay.|b
me003|right.|b
me003|excellent.|b
me003|do we have anything else to say about this?|qy
me012|we can do a little demo.|s^na
me003|oh the|s^bk.%--
me003|yeah we could.|s^aa^rt
me003|but the demo doesn't work very well.|s^arp
mn015|no.|s^ar
mn015|then it wouldn't be a demo.|s
me012|i mean we can do a demo in the sense that we can um just observe the fact that this will in fact do inference.|s^df
mn015|i was just going to|s.%--
me003|observe nodes.|s^2
me012|so we can you know set some of the uh nodes.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|go ahead.|s^co
me012|and then try to find the probability of other nodes.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|dat-dat-dah.|s^t1
me003|what should i observe?|qw
me012|just set a few of them.|s^co
me012|you don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time.|s^co
me012|just like uh maybe the fact that they use a certain verb.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me012|actually forget the verb.|s^co
me003|okay.|s^bk
me012|just uh|s.%--
me012|i don't know.|s^no
me012|say they discussed the admission fee.|s
me003|okay.|b
me012|and uh the place has nice walls.|s
me003|i love nice walls.|s^bk^j
me003|okay.|s^bk^rt
me003|i'm a big fan.|s^j
fe004|it's starting to grow on me.|s^aa
me012|and it's night.|s
me003|and the time of day is night?|qy^bu^d^m
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|no.|s^ar^bsc
me012|wait.|h
me012|that that doesn't uh|s.%--
me012|it's not really consistent.|s^df
me012|they don't discuss the admission fee.|s
me012|make that false.|s^co
me003|all right.|s^bk
me012|and it's night.|s
me003|oh they|%--
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|oh whoops.|s^t1
me012|that didn't work.|s
me003|i forgot to uh|s.%--
me003|ach!|s^fe
fe004|i'd like to do that again.|s
me003|one thing that bugs me about javabayes is you have to click that and do this.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|that seems kind of redundant.|s^na
fe004|but|s.%--
me012|okay.|s^tc
me003|that all you want?|qy^d^rt
me012|yes.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|so let's see.|s^t1
me003|i want to query.|s^bu
me012|go and right query.|s^co
me003|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me003|the mode.|s
me003|okay and then on here|s^rt^t1.%--
me003|so let's see.|s^t1
me012|so that is the probability that they're entering vista ing or tango ing.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|yeah.|b
me012|and uh|s.%-
fe004|so slightly biased toward tango ing?|qy^bu^d^rt
me012|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|b
me003|if it's night time they have not discussed admission fee and the walls are nice.|s
me003|so yeah.|s
me003|i guess that sort of makes sense.|s^am
me003|the reason i say the demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh observed everything in favor of taking a tour.|s^df^rt
me003|and it came up as tango.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^f^g
me003|over and over again.|s
fe004|so|s.%-
me003|we couldn't we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of tango.|s^j
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|huh!|s^fe
me012|it loves the tango.|s^j
fe004|um|fg
me012|well that's obviously just to do with our probabilities.|s
me003|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me012|like we totally hand tuned the probabilities.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me012|right.|b
me012|we were like huh well if the person does this and this and this let's say forty percent for this.|s:s^cs
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me012|fifty like you know|s.%--
me012|so obviously that's going to happen.|s
fe004|right.|b
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|yeah.|fg
mn015|but it it|s.%-
fe004|maybe the bias toward tango ing was yours then.|s
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|yeah.|s^aa
me012|it's so we have to like fit the probabilities.|s^cs
me003|that's that's at|s.%-
me003|spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte.|s^j
fe004|so the real case.|s
mn015|however you know it the purpose was not really at this stage to come up with meaningful probabilities.|s
mn015|but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and so|s.%--
mn015|and|fh
me003|we would actually|s.%--
me003|i guess once we look at the data more we'll get more hidden nodes.|s^rt
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|yeah.|b
me003|but i'd like to see more.|s
me003|not because it would expedite the probabilities because it wouldn't.|s^rt
me003|it would actually slow that down tremendously.|s
me012|um well yeah.|fg|s
me012|i guess.|s^am
me003|but|%-
me012|not that much though.|s^arp
me012|only a little early.|s^df
me003|no.|s^ar.%
me003|i think we should have uh exponentially more middle nodes than features we've extracted.|s^j
me012|okay.|s^bk
me003|i'm i'm just|s^bd.%--
fe004|so are doing business versus tourist|qy.%--
fe004|they refer to your current task.|s^bu
fe004|like like current thing you want to do at this moment.|s^e
me012|um yeah.|h|s^bk
me012|well that's that's an interesting point.|h|s^ba
me012|whether you're it's whether it's not|s.%--
fe004|and are|qy.%--
me012|i think it's more like are you are tourist.|s:qy
me012|are you in like heidelberg for a|s.%-
fe004|oh.|s^bk
fe004|so i thought that was directly given by the context switch.|s
me012|that's a different thing.|s^nd
me012|what if the context which is not set but still they say things like i want to go uh see the uh the the castle and uh et cetera?|qh:s
mn015|is it|qy.%-
me003|well the i kind of thought of doing business as more of running an errand type thing.|s
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|business on the other hand is uh definitely what you're doing.|s
mn015|so if you run out of cash as a tourist and and and you need to go to the a|s.%--
me003|so|s.%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|oh i see.|s^bk
fe004|you may have a task.|s^bs
fe004|you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage.|s^bs
mn015|huh.|b
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|right.|s^aa
mn015|how do i get to the bank.|s:qw
fe004|i see.|s^bk
fe004|huh.|b
me012|and that'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you|s.%--
me012|kind of thing.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so the tourists node should be um very consistent with the context node.|s^bu
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
fe004|if you say that's more their in general what their background is.|s
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|i think this context node is a bit of a|s.%--
me012|i don't know.|s^no
me012|like in|s.%--
me012|uh do we want to have|qy.%--
me012|like it's|s.%-
fe004|are you assuming that or not?|qr
fe004|like is that to be i mean if that's accurate then that would determine tourist node.|s^df
me012|if the context were to set one way or another that like strongly uh um says something about whether whether or not they're tourists.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|so what's interesting is when it's not when it's set to unknown.|s^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|what set the they set the context to unknown?|qw^rt
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|okay.|s^bk
me012|right now we haven't observed it.|s
me012|so i guess it's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities.|s^am
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|s^bk
me003|right.|b
me012|but yes.|s^aa^df
me012|you can set it to unknown.|s^na^rt
mn015|and if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same.|s^bu
me003|oops!|s^fe^t1
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me003|no.|s^ar
me012|well no.|s^ar
me012|because we the way we set the probabilities might not have|s.%--
me012|yeah.|h
me012|it's it's an it's an issue.|s^ba
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|like|s.%-
mn015|pretty much the same?|qy^bu^d^rt
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|it is.|s^aa
me012|so the issue is that um in belief nets it's not common to do what we did of like having you know a bunch of values and then unknown as an actual value.|s^rt
fe004|yeah.|b
me012|what's common is you just like don't observe the variable.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me012|right?|qy^d^g
me012|and then just marginalizes.|s
mn015|yep.|b
me012|but uh we didn't do this because we felt that there'd|s.%--
me012|i guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually.|s
me003|we were|s.%--
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|we were|s.%-
me012|but uh i don't know what the right thing is to do for that.|s^no
me012|i'm not i don't know if i totally am happy with the way it is.|s
mn015|why don't we|qh^cs.%--
mn015|can we|qy^rt.%--
mn015|um how long would it take to to add another node on the observatory and um play around with it?|fh|qw^rt
me012|another node on what?|qw^br^rt
me003|uh well it depends on how many things it's linked to.|h|s
mn015|let's just say make it really simple.|s
mn015|if we create something that for example would be um|s.%--
mn015|so some things can be landmarks in your sense.|s^rt
mn015|but they can never be entered.|s^rt
mn015|so for example a statue.|s
me012|good point.|s^ba
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g
me003|right.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so maybe we want to have landmark meaning now enterable landmark versus um something that's simply just a vista point for example.|s^cs^rt
me003|yeah that's true.|s^bk
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|uh a statue or um|s.%-
me012|so basically it's addressing a variable that's enterable or not.|s
me012|so like an enterable question mark.|s
me003|also you know didn't we have a size as one?|qy^bu^rt
me012|what?|qw^br
me003|the size of the landmark.|s^r^rt
me012|um not when we were doing this.|s^arp
me003|because if it's|s.%--
me003|yeah.|b
me012|but i guess at some point we did.|s
me003|for some reason i had that okay that was a thought that i had at one point.|s
me003|but then went away.|s
me012|so you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered?|qy^rt
mn015|well for example if we include that.|h|s
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|um accessibility or something.|s
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me012|huh.|b
mn015|is it can it be entered?|qy
mn015|then of course this is sort of binary as well.|s^rt
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|and then um there's also the question whether it may be entered.|s
mn015|in the sense that you know if it's tom the house of tom cruise you know it's enterable but you may not enter it.|s
mn015|you know?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|you're not allowed to.|s
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|unless you are whatever his his divorce lawyer or something.|s
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|and um and these are very observable sort of from the from the ontology sort of things.|fh|s
me003|does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though?|qy^ng
me003|whether it's practically speaking enterable or actually physically enterable or not?|qr^e^rt
fe004|it seems like it would for uh uh determining whether they want to go into it or not.|s
mn015|if if you're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not you're not usually not allowed to uh|s.%--
fe004|because they|s.%-
me003|well i can see why|s^aap.%-
mn015|let's get this uh clearer.|s^co
mn015|so it's matrix between if it's not enterable.|s
me003|whether it's a whether it's a public building and whether it's actually has a door.|s^bu
mn015|period.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|exactly.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
mn015|this is sort of uh|s.%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|so tom cruise's house is not a public building.|s
me003|but it has a door.|s
fe004|right.|b
me012|uhhuh.|b
me003|but the thing is|s.%--
me003|okay|s.%--
me003|explain to me why it's necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public.|s^co
me003|or if something|s.%--
me003|it seems like it's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door and it|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|or not public and not a door are equivalent things.|s
me003|it seems like in practice.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|right.|b
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|so we would have|s.%--
mn015|what does it mean then that we have to|qw.%--
mn015|we have an object type statue.|s
mn015|that really is an object type.|s
me003|right.|b
mn015|so there is there's going to be a bunch of statues.|s
mn015|and then we have for example an object type huh that's a hotel.|s:s
mn015|how about hotels?|qw
me003|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel.|s
mn015|it's the hotel zum ritter.|s
mn015|which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the thirty years war blah blah blah.|s
me003|huh.|b
me003|does it have nice walls?|qy^j
mn015|it has wonderful walls.|s^aa
me003|excellent.|s^bk
mn015|um and lots of detail and carvings engravings and so forth.|fh|s
mn015|so|fh
mn015|but um it's still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say.|s
mn015|but um so so if you are a|s.%--
mn015|well it's very tricky.|s
mn015|so i guess your question is so far i have no really no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities.|s
mn015|from that point of view.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|okay.|b
mn015|let let's do a|s^cs.%--
mn015|can we add just so i can see how it's done uh a has door property?|qy^rt
mn015|or|qrr.%--
me003|okay.|s^bk
me012|what would it uh connect to?|qw
me012|like what would uh it affect?|qw^e
mn015|um i think um it might affect|h|s.%--
mn015|oh actually it's it it wouldn't affect any of our nodes.|s^bu^rt
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me012|what i was thinking was if you had a like|s.%-
mn015|oh it's it affects the doing business is certainly not.|s
me003|you could affect theoretically you could affect doing business with has door.|s
me012|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|huh.|b
me012|okay.|b
mn015|it should um inhibit that.|s^bu
me012|right.|s^aa
me003|let's see.|s^t1
mn015|right?|qy^d^g
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|i don't know if javabayes is nice about that.|s^no
me012|it might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable you just like it just overwrites everything.|s
me012|but you can check.|s^cs
me003|well we have it saved.|s^rt
me003|so we can open it up again.|s^rt
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|it's true.|s^bk
me003|the safety net.|s^rt
fe004|i think you could just add it.|s
fe004|i mean i have before.|s^df
fe004|okay.|b
fe004|whew!|s^fe
me012|well that's fine.|s^ba
me012|but we have to see the function now.|s
me012|has it become all point fives or not?|qr
fe004|oh right.|s^bk
me003|let's see.|s^t1
me003|so this is has door.|s
me003|uh true false.|s
me003|that's acceptable.|s
me003|and i want to edit the function going to that.|s^rt
me003|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me012|no.|s^ar
me012|this is fine.|s^ng
me003|oh no.|s^m
me012|this business.|s
me003|right.|s^bk
me003|it was fine.|s^bk^m
me003|added this one.|s.%
me012|yep.|s^aa
me012|what would be nice if it is if it just like kept the old function for either value.|s
me003|this|%-
me012|but|fh
me012|nope.|s^ar
me012|didn't do it.|s
fe004|oh.|b
me003|oh wait.|s^co
me003|it might be|s.%--
me003|did we|qy.%--
me003|yes.|s
me003|that's not good.|s^ba
me012|that's kind of annoying.|s^ba
mn015|okay.|fg
mn015|so just dismiss everything.|s^co
mn015|close it and and load up the old state so it doesn't screw screw that up.|s^co
me003|let's see.|s^t1
me003|oops!|s^fe
me012|huh.|h
mn015|maybe you can read in.|s^cs^rt
me012|so have you used javabayes a lot?|qy^rt
fe004|yes.|s^aa
fe004|really i i've i haven't used it a lot.|s^ar
fe004|and i haven't used it in the last you know many months.|s^nd
fe004|so|fh
me012|okay.|s^bk
fe004|um uh we can ask someone.|fg|s^cs
me012|it might be worth uh asking around.|s^na
fe004|um|fg
me012|like we looked at sort of uh a page that had like a bunch of|s.%-
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|srini|s.%-
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|srini's the one to ask i would say.|s^cs^r

me003|there's like an x m l format for bayes-nets.|s
me012|is it x m l?|qy^bu^m^rt
me003|there is one.|s^aa
me003|i don't know if this uses it.|s^no
me012|oh i see.|s^bk
me012|no this doesn't use it.|s^ar
me003|but it|s.%-
me012|i didn't think it did.|s^df
me003|yeah the the|fg|s.%-
me012|you can look at the text file.|s^cs
me003|yeah.|s^aa
me012|but do you have it here?|qy^rt
me012|well maybe you don't.|s^df
me003|uh yes i do actually.|s^aa
me003|let me see.|h
me012|oh yes.|s^bk^m
me012|of course.|s
me012|like there's the|s.%-
me003|oh man.|s^ba
me003|i didn't is there an ampersand in dos?|qy^rt
me012|nope.|s^ar
me012|just start up a new d o s.|s^co
me003|that's all right.|s^ar
me003|i can probably double click on it.|s
me012|or|s.%--
me012|yeah right.|s^aa
mn015|uh|s^t1.%--
me003|let's see.|s^t1
me012|yep.|b
me003|let's see.|s^r^t1
me003|come on.|s^t1
me012|it'll ask you what you what it wants what you want to open it with and see what bat i guess.|s
me003|one of these days it should open this.|s^j
me003|theoretically.|s^j
mn015|go right mouse.|s^co^rt
mn015|open with.|s^co^rt
me012|that's|s.%--
me012|oh!|s^fe
me003|oh there we go.|s
me003|maybe it was just|s.%--
me003|oh!|s^fe
mn015|oh.|s^bk
me003|uh it was dead to the world.|s
fe004|god!|s^fe
me003|okay.|s^bk
mn015|through the old notepad.|s
mn015|that's my favorite editor.|s
me003|i like i like word pad because it has the uh the returns.|s^rt
mn015|wordpad?|qy^br^rt
mn015|i|s.%-
me003|the carriage returns on some of them.|s^rt
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|okay.|b
me003|you know how they get auto fills i guess.|s^rt
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|or whatever you call it.|s^rt
me012|anyway there it is.|s^tc
mn015|so this is sort of lisp y?|qy^rt
mn015|no.|s^ar
me012|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
me003|it just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of structs.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|yeah.|b
me012|that's how actual probability tables are specified.|s
me012|as like lists of numbers.|s
me003|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|so theoretically you could edit that.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|it just that it's|s.%--
me012|but they're not very friendly.|s
me003|yeah the ordering isn't very clear on|fg|s.%-
fe004|right.|b
me012|so you'd have to like figure out like you have to go and|s.%-
fe004|the layout of the table.|s^2
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|yeah.|b
me012|well i|s.%-
me003|actually we could write a program that could generate this.|s^cs
me012|yeah.|b
me012|i think so.|s^am
fe004|you could.|s^aa^rt
me003|yeah you could.|s^df
me012|it's not|s.%-
me003|we were doing it|s.%-
me012|yeah.|fg
me012|we can maybe write an interface for uh entering probability distributions easily.|s^cs^rt
me012|something like like a little script.|s^e
me012|that might be worth it.|s^df
mn015|and that might do.|s^am
fe004|yeah.|fg
fe004|i actually seem to recall srini complaining about something to do with entering probability.|s
fe004|so this is probably|s.%-
me012|the other thing is it is in java.|s
fe004|yeah it's|%-
fe004|yeah.|b
me012|so|fg
me003|we could manipulate the source itself?|qy^2^bu^rt
fe004|yeah.|b
me003|or|%-
mn015|do you have the true source files?|qy^rt
me003|i don't know if he actually|s^no.%-
mn015|or just the class?|qrr
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|uh yeah we do.|s^aa
me003|does he|qy.%-
me012|i i saw directory called source.|s
me003|oh.|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|i didn't|s.%--
me012|or|%-
me012|yeah.|b
me012|go up one.|s^co^rt
me003|up one.|s^bk^m
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|uh yes good.|s^ba
me003|source.|s
me003|that's that's quite nice.|s^ba
me012|i don't know if it actually manipulate the source though.|s^no
me012|that might be a bit complicated.|s
me012|i think it might it might be simpler to just have a script that you know|s^cs.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|it's like friendly.|s
fe004|the the data tables.|s
me012|it allows you enter things well.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me003|right.|b
mn015|but if if there is an x m l file that or format that it can also read|s.%--
mn015|i mean it just reads this.|s
mn015|right?|qy^d^g
mn015|when it starts.|s
me012|uhhuh.|fg
me003|yeah i know there is an i was looking on the web page.|s
me003|and he's updated it for an x m l version of i guess bayes-nets.|s
me003|there's a bayes-net spec for in x m l.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|he's like this guy has?|qy^bu^rt
me012|the javabayes guy?|qy^bu^d^g^rt
me003|yeah.|s^aa
me012|so but he doesn't use it.|s
me012|so in what sense has he updated it?|qw
me003|well you can either you or you can read both.|s
me012|oh i see.|s^bk
me003|to my understanding.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
fe004|oh.|s^bk
me012|that would be awesome.|s^ba
me003|because uh|s.%--
me003|well at least the uh|s.%--
me003|i could have misread the web page.|s
me003|i have a habit of doing that.|s
me003|but|fh
mn015|okay wonderful.|s^ba
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so you got more slides?|qy^rt^tc
me003|do i have more slides.|s^m
me003|um yes.|h|s
me003|one more.|s
me003|future work.|s
me003|i think every presentation have a should have a future work slide.|s^cs
me003|but uh it's basically|s.%--
me003|we already talked about all this stuff.|s
me003|so|fh
me012|um the additional thing is i guess learning the probabilities also.|s
me012|that's maybe|s.%--
me012|i don't know if|s^no.%-
me003|uh that's future future work.|s^aap
me012|does|%-
me012|that's|s.%-
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|right.|b
me012|very future.|s^bk^m
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|and of course if you have a presentation that doesn't have something that doesn't work at all then you have what i learned as a slide.|s:s
fe004|can't you have both?|qy^bu
me003|you could.|s^aa^rt
me003|my first approach failed.|s
fe004|right.|b
me003|what i learned.|s
me003|okay so i think that uh our presentation's finished.|s^t^tc
mn015|good.|s^ba
me003|i know what i like about these meetings is one person will nod and then the next person will nod and then it just goes all the way around the room.|s
mn015|so the uh|fg
fe004|i missed my turn.|s^j
me003|no i earlier i went and bhaskara went and you did it.|s
me003|you did it.|s
mn015|it's like yawning.|s
fe004|it's like yawning.|s^aa^m
mn015|and this announcement was in stereo.|s
me012|ha!|s^fe
mn015|okay.|fg
mn015|so this means um|s.%-
me003|should i pull up the net again?|qy^rt
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|could you put the the um net up again?|qy^rt
me003|yes.|s^aa
fe004|thanks.|s^ft
me003|there we go.|s
me003|and actually i was|s^t1.%-
me003|because i got a wireless mike on.|s^t1
fe004|so a more general thing than discussed admission fee um could be|s.%--
fe004|i i'm just wondering whether the context the background context of the discourse might be|s.%--
fe004|i don't know.|s^no
fe004|if there's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way.|s
fe004|um there might be other cues that say um in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes.|s:s
fe004|uh i don't know if that might be|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uh and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up.|fg|s
mn015|i think we|s.%-
mn015|i think a a sort of general strategy here|s.%--
mn015|you know this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms|s.%--
mn015|is that maybe we we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee.|s^rt
mn015|and something else and something else that happened in the discourse before.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|right.|b
mn015|and um let's make those four.|fh|s
mn015|and maybe there are two um|s.%--
mn015|so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net which has two has it's own middle layer.|s
mn015|maybe this you know has some kind of um funky thing that|s.%--
mn015|if this|s.%--
mn015|and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse.|s
mn015|which is maybe something that is uh a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe.|s
mn015|so things that point towards|s.%-
me003|so instead of single node for like if they said the word admission fee|s^bs.%--:s.%--
fe004|exactly.|b
fe004|yeah.|b
me003|admission fee or maybe you know how much to enter.|s
me003|or you know something.|s
fe004|opening hours or something like that.|s^2^rt
me003|other cues.|s
me003|exactly.|s^aa
me003|that would all funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that.|s
mn015|so pay a visit|s^bu.%-:s.%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uh uh|%-
me012|sure.|s^aa
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|yeah?|qy^bh
fe004|i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse.|s
fe004|i mean that's like the bigger um version of it.|s
mn015|exactly.|fg
mn015|yeah.|fg
mn015|and then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before.|s^rt
mn015|um it's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else.|s
mn015|and that you are in a in a in a route.|s
mn015|um sort of proceeding past these things.|s
mn015|so this would be just something that where you want to pass it.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|is that it?|qy^d^g
mn015|however these are of course then|s.%--
mn015|the the nodes the observed nodes for your middle layer.|s
mn015|so this again points to final destination doing business tourist hurry and so forth.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|okay.|b
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|and so then we can say okay.|s:s
mn015|we have a whole region in a|s.%-
fe004|that's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer.|s^bu
mn015|yeah exactly.|s^aa
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
mn015|and this is just then just one.|s
mn015|so because at the end the more we um add you know the more spider-web-ish it's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing.|s
mn015|it's going to get very ugly.|s
mn015|but with this way we could say okay these are the discourse phenomena.|s
mn015|they may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer um or the general hidden layer.|s
me012|sure.|b
mn015|and the same we will be able to do for syntactic information.|s
mn015|the verbs used the object types used modifiers.|s^e
mn015|and maybe there's a hidden layer for that.|s
me012|yep.|s^aa
mn015|and so forth and so forth.|s
mn015|then we have context.|s
me012|yeah.|fg
me012|so essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little bayes-nets of their own.|s^bu
mn015|yep.|s^aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|precisely.|s^aa
mn015|so|fh
me003|one thing that's kind of been bugging me when i more i look at this is that the|s.%--
me003|i guess the fact that the there's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output.|s
me012|yeah.|s^am
me003|i mean it makes it cleaner but then uh i mean|s^df.%--
me012|that's true.|s^aa
me003|for instance if the discourse does|s.%-
fe004|what do you mean by that?|qw^rt
me003|well for instance the discourse admission fee node seems like it should point directly to the|s.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|or increase the probability of enter directly versus going there via tourist.|s^rt:s
me012|yeah.|fg
me012|or we could like add more uh sort of middle nodes.|s^cs
me012|like we could add a node like do they want to enter it.|s:qw
me012|which is affected by admission fee and by whether it's closed and by whether it has a door.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|so it's like there are those are the two options.|s
me003|right.|b
me012|either like make an arrow directly or put a new node.|s
fe004|huh.|b
me003|yeah.|b
me003|that makes sense.|s^ba
mn015|yeah.|fg
mn015|and if it if you do it if you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like so how much has it cost to enter.|s:qw
mn015|and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars.|s
mn015|and then the persons says um yeah i want to see it.|s:s
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^g
mn015|meaning it's way out of my budget.|s:s
mn015|um|fh
me003|there are places in germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter?|qy^d
mn015|um nothing comes to mind.|h|s^ar
mn015|without thinking too hard.|s^rt
mn015|um maybe|s^am.%--
mn015|yeah of course.|s^aa
mn015|um opera premiers.|s
me003|really?|qy^bh
mn015|so you know|s.%--
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|or or any good old pink floyd concert.|s
me003|i see.|s^bk
me003|if you want to see the magic flute or something.|s^rt:s
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|or maybe um a famous restaurant.|s
fe004|or i don't know.|s^no
fe004|there are various things that you might not want to eat a meal there but your own table.|s
me003|the spagos of heidelberg.|s
mn015|i think that the i mean nothing beats the the admission charge prices in japan.|s
mn015|so there two hundred dollars is is moderate for getting into a discotheque.|s
mn015|you know.|s^d^f
me012|really?|qy^bh
mn015|then again everything else is free then once you're in there.|s
mn015|food and drink and so forth.|s
mn015|so i mean|s.%--
mn015|but you know we can|s.%--
mn015|something somebody can have discussed the admission fee and the answer is if we|s.%--
mn015|um you know um still based on that result is never going to enter that building.|s
me003|huh.|b
mn015|you know.|s^f
mn015|because it's just too expensive.|s
me003|oh yeah.|fg
me003|i think i see.|s
me003|so the discourse refers to admission fee but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse.|s^bu
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|you have to have some notion of not just|s.%--
fe004|i mean there's a there's change across several turns of discourse.|s
me003|right.|b
fe004|so i don't know how if any of this was discussed but how if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh other other discourse processing that might be happen.|s^no
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|i mean|s.%--
me012|yeah yeah.|b
me003|what sort of discourse processing is uh are the|qw.%--
me003|how much is built into smartkom and|qw.%--
mn015|it works like this.|s
mn015|the uh um i mean|s.%--
mn015|the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of|s.%--
mn015|they tried to figure out the intention.|s
mn015|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|simply by parsing it.|s
mn015|and this um won't differentiate between all modes.|s
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|but at least it'll tell us okay here we have something that|s.%--
mn015|somebody that wants to go someplace.|s
mn015|now it's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening.|s
mn015|and um if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed|s.%--
mn015|what happens is you know the parser parses it.|s^rt
mn015|and then it's handed on to the discourse history which is um one of the most elaborate elaborate modules.|s
mn015|it's it's actually the the whole memory of the entire system that knows what who said what which was what was presented.|s
mn015|it helps anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted.|s
mn015|so um|s.%--
mn015|because you say okay how can i get to the castle.|s:qw
mn015|oh how how much is it.|s:qw
mn015|and um yeah i would like uh um to let's do it and so forth.|s:s
mn015|so even without an anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here.|s
me003|uhhuh.|b
mn015|because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened.|s
mn015|so whenever the uh um person is not actually rejecting what happened before.|s
mn015|so as in no i really don't want to see that movie.|s:s
mn015|i'd rather stay home and watch t v.|s:s
mn015|um what movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the into the representations every at each dialogue step by the discourse model discourse model.|fh|s
mn015|yeah that's what it's called.|s^t1
mn015|and um it does some help in the anaphora resolution.|s^t1
mn015|and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues.|s
mn015|so a person pointing to something on the screen you know|s.%--
me003|huh.|b
mn015|the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the on the screen.|s
mn015|so it's a it's a rather huge huge thing.|s
mn015|but um um we can sort of|fh|s.%--
mn015|it has a very clear interface.|s
mn015|we can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn.|s
mn015|and and the turn before that or you know|s.%--
mn015|how deep we want to search|s.%--
me003|okay.|b
mn015|um which is a question.|s
mn015|how deep do we want to sear?|qh
mn015|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|um but we should try to keep in mind that you know we're doing this sort of for research.|fh|s
mn015|so we we should find a limit that's reasonable and not go you know all the way back to adam and eve.|s
mn015|you know did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life?|qh
mn015|and the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise.|s
mn015|and|s.%--
mn015|anyway|fh
fe004|so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of admission fee discussion as a cue for entry is thinking about the plans that various people might have.|s
fe004|like all the different sort of general schemas that they might be following.|s
fe004|okay.|fh
fe004|this person is um finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business.|s^rt
fe004|um because then anything that's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan.|s^rt
fe004|um i don't know.|s^no
fe004|they're in in in sort of more traditional a i kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know some idea at each turn of agent doing something.|s
fe004|okay what plans is this a consistent with?|qh
fe004|and then get some more information and then you see here's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into.|s
fe004|it it might be useful here too.|s^am
fe004|i i don't know how|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|you know you'd have to figure out what what knowledge representation would work for that.|s
mn015|i mean the|s.%-
me003|huh.|b
mn015|it's in the these these these plan schemas.|s^rt
mn015|i mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate.|s
mn015|you know.|s^f
mn015|what do you need need to buy a ticket?|qh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|you know.|s^f
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and it it's fifty steps.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter.|s
mn015|you know and and maybe that's helpful to look at it to look at those.|s
mn015|it's amazing what human beings can do.|s
mn015|when we talked uh we had the example you know of you being uh a a person on a ticket counter working at railway station.|s
mn015|and somebody runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands says new york.|s:s
mn015|and you say track seven.|s
mn015|huh?|qh^rt
mn015|and it's because you know that that person actually is following you know you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps you know without any information other than new york.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|inferring everything from the context.|s
mn015|so works|s.%--
mn015|um even though there is probably no train from here to new york.|s
mn015|right?|qy^d^f^g
fe004|huh.|b
fe004|not direct.|s^arp
me003|you'd uh probably have to transfer in chicago.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|but uh it's possible.|s
mn015|um no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else.|s^nd
mn015|right?|qy^d^g
mn015|is that san francisco chicago?|qy^bu^rt
me003|i think|s^rt.%-
mn015|is that possible?|qy^d^g^rt
me003|one time i saw a report on trains.|s
me003|and i think there is a|s.%--
me003|i don't know if|s^no.%--
me003|i thought there was a line that went from somewhere.|s
me003|maybe it was sacramento to chicago.|s
me003|but there was like a california to chicago line of some sort.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|huh.|b
me003|i could be wrong though.|s
me003|it was a while ago.|s
fe004|the transcontinental railroad.|s
fe004|doesn't that ring a bell?|qy
fe004|i think it has to exist somewhere.|s
me003|yeah.|b
me003|but i don't know if it's still|s.%--
me003|they might have blown it up.|s
mn015|well it never went all the way.|s
mn015|right?|qy
mn015|i mean you always had to change trains at omaha.|s
fe004|well most of the way.|s
fe004|uh uhhuh.|b
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|one track ended there and the other one started at five meters away from that.|s^rt
fe004|yeah.|b
mn015|and sort of|s.%--
fe004|well you seem to know better than we do so.|s
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^g
mn015|has anybody ever been on an amtrak?|qy^rt
fe004|i have.|s^rt
fe004|but not transcontinentally.|s
me003|i'm frightened by amtrak myself.|s^ng
me012|what?|qw
me012|why?|qw
me003|i just|s.%--
me003|they seem to have a lot of accidents on the amtrak.|s
me012|really?|qy^bh^rt
mn015|their reputation is very bad.|s^e
me003|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|it's not maybe reality.|s^am
fe004|it's not like german trains.|s
fe004|like german trains are really great.|s
fe004|so|fh
mn015|but you know i don't know whether it's which ones are safer you know statistically.|s^no
fe004|um but they're faster.|fg|s
me012|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|much faster.|s^aa^m
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|and there's much more of them.|s^e
me012|yeah they're yeah it's way better.|s^e
mn015|yeah i used um amtrak quite a bit on the east coast.|s
mn015|and i was surprised.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|it was actually okay.|s
mn015|you know on boston new york.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
mn015|new york rhode island.|s
me012|yeah.|b
me012|i've done that kind of thing.|s
mn015|whatever.|s
mn015|boston.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|but|s^rt.%--
mn015|that's a different issue.|s
me003|this is going to be an interesting transcript.|s
mn015|huh.|b
me012|i i want to see what it does with uh landmark-iness.|s
me012|that's|s.%--
me003|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|let's all say it a few more times.|s^co^j
fe004|just kidding.|s^ba
me012|so|fh
me003|it'd help it figure it out?|qy^bu^j^rt
fe004|right.|b
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|so by the way that structure that robert drew on the board was like more um cue type based.|s^bu
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
fe004|here's like we're going to segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse.|s
fe004|and then some of the things we're talking about here are more|s.%--
fe004|you know we mentioned maybe if they talk about um|s.%--
fe004|i don't know.|s^no
fe004|entering or you know like they might be more task based.|s^rt
me003|huh.|b
fe004|so i i don't know if there there's obviously some more than one way of organizing the variables into something.|s^no
fe004|so|fh
mn015|i think that um what you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks and maybe some of their conditions.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|one task is more likely you're in a hurry when you do that kind of doing business.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and and less in a hurry when uh you're a tourist.|s
mn015|um tourists may have never have final destinations you know because they are eternally traveling around.|fh|s
mn015|so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task based middle layer.|fh|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and then we'll get these sub middle layers that are more cue based.|s
fe004|that feed into those.|s^2
mn015|nah?|qy^d^f^g
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world.|s
mn015|so um i suggest to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions.|s^cs
mn015|and we make up some some toy observable nodes.|s^cs
mn015|is that what|qy^rt.%-
me003|refined just refine the|s.%--
me012|okay.|s^aa
mn015|what's the technical term?|qw
me012|for which?|qw^d^rt
mn015|for the uh nodes that are observable.|s^rt
mn015|the outer layer.|s^e
me012|just observable nodes.|s
me012|evidence nodes.|s
me003|the features.|s
me003|i don't know.|s^no
me003|whatever you|s.%-
mn015|feature make up some features for those.|s^cs
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|identify four regions.|s^cs
mn015|maybe make up some features for each region.|s^rt
mn015|and uh and uh uh and uh|fh
mn015|middle layer for those.|s^rt
mn015|and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan based deep space.|s
me012|yeah.|b
me003|basically just refine some of the more general nodes.|s^bs
mn015|yep they they will be ad hoc for for for some time to come.|s^df
me012|yeah this is totally like|fg|s.%-
me012|the probabilities and all are completely ad hoc.|s
me012|we need to look at all of them.|s^cs
me012|i mean but they're even like i mean like close to the end we were like uh you know we were like uh really ad hoc.|s
fe004|it's a even distribution.|s^ba
fe004|like|s.%--
fe004|whatever.|s^ba
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|because if it's like uh if it's four things coming in.|s
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me012|and say some of them have like three possibilities and all that.|s
me012|so you're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter.|s
fe004|and|%-
fe004|that's terrible.|s^ba
me012|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me012|so|s.%--
me003|some of them are completely absurd too.|s^e
fe004|that's uh well|s.%-
me003|like they want to enter but it's closed.|s^rt
me003|it's night time.|s^rt
me003|you know|s^f.%--
me003|there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you're like|s.%-
me012|yeah the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect.|s
me003|confused.|s^2
fe004|in which case you're supposed to alert the authorities and see appropriate action.|s
me012|yeah.|b
me003|yeah.|b
me012|yeah another thing to do um is also to um i guess to ask around people about other bayes-net packages.|fg|s^cs
me012|is srini going to be at the meeting tomorrow?|qy^rt
me012|do you know?|qy^rt
fe004|maybe.|s^am
mn015|the day after tomorrow.|s^bc
me012|wait|%-
fe004|quite possibly.|s^am
fe004|oh oh sorry.|s^fa
mn015|wednesday.|s
me012|day after tomorrow.|s
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|sorry.|s^fa^r
fe004|wednesday.|s^bk^m
fe004|yeah.|b
me012|maybe we can ask him about it.|s^cs
me003|who's talking on wednesday?|qw^rt
fe004|huh.|b
me003|i haven't jerry never sent out a sent out an email.|s^no
me003|did he ever?|qy
me012|no.|s^ar
me012|but he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking.|s
me012|i forget who.|s^no
me012|uh|fh
mn015|oh.|fg
mn015|isn't ben?|qy^rt
fe004|ben?|qy^br^m^rt
fe004|i think it's ben actually.|s^na
mn015|ben then.|s
mn015|ben.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me003|uh!|s^fe
fe004|um|fh
fe004|giving his job talk i think.|s
fe004|um|fh
fe004|sorry.|s^fa
fe004|i was just reading the screen.|s
mn015|okay.|s^bk
me012|oh.|s^bk
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|so the uh|s.%--
mn015|that will be one one thing we could do.|s^rt
mn015|i actually uh have um|s.%--
mn015|also we can uh start looking at the smartkom tables.|s
mn015|and i will|s.%--
me003|right.|b
mn015|i actually wanted to show that to you guys now.|s
mn015|but um|fh
me003|do you want to trade?|qy^rt
mn015|um no.|h|s^ar
mn015|i i actually made a mistake because it it fell asleep.|s^rt
mn015|and when linux falls asleep on my machine it's it doesn't wake up ever.|s^rt
mn015|so i had to reboot.|s^rt
fe004|oh no!|s^by^fe^rt
mn015|and if i reboot without a network i will not be able to start smartkom because i need to have a network.|s
me003|uh.|s^bk
mn015|so we'll do that maybe uh|s.%-
me012|but|s.%--
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|but once you start start smartkom you can be on you don't have to be on a network anymore.|s^rt
me012|is that the deal?|qy^rt
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me012|uh interesting.|s^ba
me003|why does smartkom need a network?|qw^rt
mn015|um it looks up some stuff that you know is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a d h c p request.|h|s
mn015|so it you know my computer does not know its i p address.|s
mn015|you know?|qy^d^f
me003|uh.|s^bk
mn015|you know so|s.%--
mn015|unless it boots up with networking.|s
me003|it's plugged in.|s^2
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|and i don't have an i p address they can't look up|s.%--
mn015|they don't know who localhost is and so forth and so forth.|s
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|always fun.|s^j
mn015|but it's a um simple solution.|s
mn015|we can just um go downstairs and and and look at this.|s
mn015|but maybe not today.|s^am
mn015|the other thing um i will|h|s^t^tc.%--
mn015|oh yeah.|s^t1
mn015|okay i have to report um data collection.|s^t
mn015|we interviewed fey.|s^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|s^bk^rt
mn015|she's willing to do it.|s^rt
mn015|meaning be the wizard for the data collection.|s
mn015|also maybe transcribe a little bit if she has to.|s^rt
mn015|but also recruiting subjects organizing them and so forth.|s
mn015|so that looks good.|s^rt
mn015|jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her.|s^rt
mn015|see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard.|s^rt
mn015|and i talked to liz about this.|s
mn015|and it looks as if friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data.|s
me012|so who would be the subject of this trial run?|qw
mn015|pardon me?|qw^br
me012|who will there be a is one is you one of you going to be the subject?|qy^rt
me012|like are you|qy.%--
mn015|um liz also volunteered to be the first subject which i think might be even better than us guys.|s
fe004|good.|b
me003|one of us.|s^2
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|if we do need her for the technical stuff then of course one of you has to sort of uh jump in.|s
me003|i like how we've you guys have successfully narrowed it down.|s^j
me003|is one of you going to be the subject.|s:qy^rt
me003|is one of you|s.%--:qy^rt.%--
me003|jump in.|s^co^j
fe004|reference.|s
fe004|i haven't done it yet.|s
me012|well i just figured it has to be someone who's um familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard so we can uh see if they're you know good.|s^df
fe004|oh plants someone who can plant difficult things.|s^bu
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|i mean that's what we want to check.|s^bu
me012|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|um|h
fe004|well in this case it's a it's a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject.|s^bu^rt
me012|isn't that what it is?|qy^rt
fe004|it's uh|s.%-
mn015|yes we we would like to test the wizard.|s^aa|s^na
mn015|but you know if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task or any of the set up we get a more realistic|s.%--
me012|i guess that would be reasonable.|s^am
fe004|yeah.|b
me003|yeah.|b
mn015|you know set up as|s.%-
me003|i know.|s
me003|that's probably a good enough test of|s.%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|sort of having an actively antagonistic uh|s^j.%--
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|that might be a little unfair.|s^arp
fe004|um|fh
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|i'm sure if we uh|s.%--
fe004|you think there's a chance we might need liz for whatever the technical side of things.|s^bu^rt
fe004|i'm sure we can get other people around who don't know anything um if we want another subject.|s
mn015|yeah yeah.|b
fe004|you know like i can drag ben into it or something.|s^cs^e
fe004|although he might cause problems.|s^j
fe004|but|s.%--
fe004|so is it a experimental setup for the um data collection totally ready determined?|qy
me003|i like that.|s^ba^t3
me003|test the wizard.|s^t3:s^co
me003|i want that on a t shirt.|s^j^t3
mn015|um i think it's it's it's i mean|s.%--
mn015|experimental setup on the technical issue.|s^rt
mn015|yes.|s^aa
mn015|except we i think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard.|s^rt
mn015|just a tape recorder that's running in a room.|s^e^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|but um in terms of specifying the scenario um uh uh we've gotten a little further.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|but um we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard.|fh|s^rt
mn015|and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe.|s
mn015|so so if if on friday it turns out that she really likes it and and we really like her then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and getting all the details completely figured out.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and um|fh
fe004|okay.|fg
fe004|so the ideal task um will have whatever|s.%--
fe004|i don't know how much the structure of the evolving bayes-net will affect|s^no.%--
fe004|like we want to we want to be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that.|s^bu
mn015|huh yeah some|s.%--
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
fe004|in the course of the task?|qy^d^g^rt
fe004|well not all of them.|s^df
fe004|but you know|s.%--
mn015|i'm even this this tango enter vista is sort of itself an ad hoc scenario.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|the the basic um idea behind the uh data collection was the following.|s
mn015|the data we get from munich is very command line.|s
mn015|simple linguistic stuff.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|hardly anything complicated.|s
mn015|no metaphors whatsoever.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|not a rich language.|s
mn015|so we wanted just to collect data to get that that that elicits more uh that elicits richer language.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and we actually did not want to constrain it too much.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|just see what people say.|s
mn015|and then maybe we'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve you know with whatever engine we we come up with.|s
mn015|um so this this this is a parallel track.|fh|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|you know there they hopefully meet.|s
fe004|so in other words this data collection is more general.|s^bs
mn015|but since|s.%-
fe004|it could it could be used for not just this task.|s
mn015|it should tell us you know what kind of phenomenon could occur.|s
mn015|it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being.|s^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and the sort of differences there.|s^rt
mn015|so it may get us some more information on the human machine pragmatics um that no one knows anything about as of yesterday.|s
mn015|and uh nothing has changed since then.|s
mn015|so|s.%--
mn015|uh and secondly now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this.|fg|s
mn015|and especially since um johno can't stop tango-ing we may actually include you know those those intentions.|s
mn015|so now i think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit uh|s^cs.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|not it's implicit that the person wants to enter.|s^bsc
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and maybe some task where it's more or less explicit.|s^cs
mn015|that the person wants to take a picture.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|or see it or something.|s^e
mn015|so that we can label it.|s
mn015|i mean that's how we get a corpus that we can label.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|exactly.|s^bk
mn015|whereas you know if we'd just get data we'd never know what they actually wanted.|s
mn015|we'd get no cues.|s
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me003|alrighty.|s^bk
me012|okay.|s^rt^tc
mn015|that was that.|s^rt^tc
me003|so is this the official end of the meeting now?|qy^rt^tc
me012|yep.|s^aa
fe004|looks like it.|s
me012|so what's economics the fallacy?|qw
me003|i just randomly label things.|s
me003|so that has nothing to do with economics or anything.|s
me012|oh really?|qy^bh
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn015|maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue.|s^cs
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|switching|s.%--
