me011|okay we're on.|bk
me013|okay.|bk
me011|so i mean everyone who's on the wireless check that they're on?|bu
mn017|we|%--
me001|all right.|bk
fe008|i see.|bk
mn017|yeah.|aa
fe008|yeah.|aa
me011|okay our agenda was quite short.|fg
me013|oh could you close the door maybe?|fg
me011|sure.|aa
me013|yeah.|bk
me011|two items which was uh digits and possibly stuff on on uh forced alignment.|s
me011|which jane said that liz and andreas had information on.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|but they didn't.|s
me011|so|fh
me013|i guess the only other thing uh for which i|s
mn017|we should do that second.|cs
mn017|because liz might join us in time for that.|df
me011|okay.|aa
me013|um|fg
me013|okay so there's digits alignments.|fh
me013|and um|fh
me013|i guess the other thing which i came unprepared for uh is uh to see if there's anything anybody wants to discuss about the saturday meeting.|t
me011|right.|bk
me013|so|fh
me013|any i mean maybe not.|s
me011|digits and alignments.|s
me011|but|fh
me013|uh|fh
mn017|talk about aligning people's schedules.|s
me013|yeah.|aa
me011|yeah.|aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|aa
me013|i mean|%--
me013|right.|b
me013|yeah i mean it was|s
me011|yeah it's forced alignment of people's schedules.|fg
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|if we're very|s
mn014|forced align.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|with with whatever it was a month and a half or something ahead of time the only time we could find in common roughly in common was on a saturday.|rt
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
me013|ugh.|b
mn017|it's pretty sad.|ba
me013|yeah.|aa
mn017|yeah.|bk
fe008|have have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of in more of the meeting?|cs
fe008|i i mean i don't know.|bd
fe008|if we had the if we had the telephone on the table|cs
me013|no.|ar
me013|but i mean he probably has to go do something.|s
mn017|no actually i i have to i have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places.|ar
me013|right?|d
fe008|i see okay.|bk
mn017|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and i don't have and i don't um have a cell phone.|s
mn014|a cell phone?|br
mn017|so i can't be having a conference call while driving.|s
fe008|no it's not good.|ar
me013|right.|fg
fe008|that's not good.|ba
me013|so we have to we|s
mn017|plus it would make for interesting noise background noise.|s
me011|yep.|aa
mn017|uh|fh
me013|so we have to equip him with a with a with a head mounted uh cell phone.|s
me011|and we'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits.|fg
me013|and|fh
mn017|oh yeah.|aa
me011|so it could get real real car noise.|df
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|oh yeah.|aa
me001|take advantage.|j
mn014|and with the kids in the background.|na
mn017|i'll let i'd let|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|i let uh my five year old have a try at the digits.|j
mn017|uh|fh
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so anyway i can talk about digits.|fg
me011|um did everyone get the results or shall i go over them again?|qr
me011|i mean that it was basically the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well.|s
me011|um and in retrospect that's not as surprising as maybe|s
me011|it shouldn't have been as surprising as i as as i felt it was.|s
me011|the lapel mike is a very high quality microphone.|s
me011|and as morgan pointed out that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking.|s
mn017|exactly.|aa
mn014|yeah.|aa
me001|uhhuh.|b
me011|um so uh|fh
me001|it's it|%--
me013|well it's yeah sort of the the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that the lapel's going to be better on.|fg
mn014|or the cross talk.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|the lapel is typically worse on the on clothes rustling.|s
me013|but if no one's rustling their clothes|s
me011|right i mean a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits.|aa
me013|it's it's|%--
me011|so it's it's a very different task than sort of the natural.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|you don't move much during reading digits i think.|na
me011|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|aa
me011|right.|aa
me001|probably the fact that it picks up other people's speakers other people's talking is an indication of that it the fact it is a good microphone.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|right.|aa
me013|right so in the digits in most most cases there weren't other people talking.|aa
me001|so|fh
me011|right.|b
mn017|do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them?|rt
me013|so|fh
me013|there typically don't no.|nd
mn017|because i i suppose you could make some that have sort of that you have to orient towards your mouth.|df
mn017|and then it would|s
me011|they have a little bit.|s
me011|but they're not noise cancelling.|s
me011|so uh|fh
me013|they're they're intended to be omni-directional.|s
me011|right.|aa
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and it's and because you don't know how people are going to put them on you know.|s
me011|right.|b
me011|so also andreas on that one the the back part of it should be right against your head.|fg
me011|and that will keep it from flopping up and down as much.|e
mn017|it is against my head.|s
me011|okay.|bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|um yeah we actually talked about this in the uh front end meeting this morning too.|fg
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|much the same thing.|e
me013|and and it was|s
me013|uh i mean there the point of interest to the group was primarily that um the uh the system that we had that was based on h.t.k. that's used by you know all the participants in aurora was so much worse than the than the s.r.i.|rt
me011|everybody.|2
me013|and the interesting thing is that even though yes it's a digits task and that's a relatively small number of words and there's a bunch of digits that you train on it's just not as good as having a a very large amount of data and training up a a a nice good big h.m.m.|s
me013|um also you had the adaptation in the s.r.i. system which we didn't have in this.|s
me013|um so um|fh
mn017|and we know|s
mn017|did i send you some results without adaptation?|rt
me011|no.|ar
me011|or if you did i didn't include them.|s
me013|i think stephane uh had seen them.|s
me011|because it was|df
me013|so|fh
mn017|yeah i think i did actually.|df
mn017|so there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|um|fh
mn017|a a a couple percent or|s
mn017|i mean|%--
mn017|well i don't know it overall|%--
mn017|uh i i don't remember.|no
mn017|but there was there was a significant um loss or win from adaptation with with adaptation.|s
mn017|and um|fh
mn017|that was the phone loop adaptation.|s
mn017|and then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh win from doing um you know adaptation to the recognition hypotheses.|s
mn017|and i tried both means adaptation and means and variances.|s
mn017|and the variances added another or subtracted another point one percent.|s
mn017|so it's um that's the number there.|s
mn017|point six i believe is what you get with both uh means and variance adaptation.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|but i think one thing is that uh i would presume|s
me013|have you ever have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual t.i. digits test set?|rt
mn017|this exact same recognizer?|br
mn017|no.|ar
me013|it might be interesting to do that.|cs
me013|because my my because my sense|df
me013|um|fh
mn017|but but i have i mean people people at s.r.i. are actually working on digits.|s
me011|i bet it would do even slightly better.|s
mn017|i could and they are using a system that's um you know is actually trained on digits.|s
mn017|um but otherwise uses the same you know decoder the same uh training methods and so forth.|df
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and i could ask them what they get on t.i. digits.|cs
me013|yeah although i'd be i think it'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system.|bk
me013|so that these numbers were comparable.|df
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|well adam knows how to run it.|s
me013|and try it out on t.i. digits.|cs
me011|yeah no problem.|aa
mn017|so you just make a|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|because our sense from the other from the aurora uh task is that|df
me011|and try it with t.i. digits.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean because we were getting sub one percent numbers on t.i. digits also with the tandem thing.|df
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me013|so one so there were a number of things we noted from this.|s
me013|one is yeah the s.r.i. system is a lot better than the h.t.k.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|this you know very limited training h.t.k. system.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh but the other is that um the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes uh are actually a lot harder than the studio recording t.i. digits.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|i think you know one reason for that uh might be that there's still even though it's close talking there still is some noise and some room acoustics.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and another might be that uh i'd i would presume that in the studio uh uh situation recording read speech that if somebody.|s
me013|did something a little funny or pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they didn't include it.|s
me011|they didn't include it?|2
me013|they made them do it again.|e
me011|whereas i took out the ones that i noticed that were blatant that were correctable.|s
me013|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so that if someone just read the wrong digit i corrected it.|s
me011|and then there was another one where jose couldn't tell whether i couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six.|rt
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and i asked him and he couldn't tell either.|s
me026|huh.|b
me011|so i just cut it out.|s
me011|you know so i just edited out the first uh word of the utterance.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|um so there's a little bit of correction but it's definitely not as clean as t.i. digits.|s
me011|so my expectations is t.i. digits would especially|s
me011|i think t.i. digits is all american english.|bu
me011|right?|d
me011|so it would probably do even a little better still.|s
me013|uhhuh.|aa
me011|on the s.r.i. system.|e
me011|but we could give it a try.|bd
mn017|well|fg
mn017|but remember we're using a telephone bandwidth front end here uh on this uh on this s.r.i. system.|s
mn017|so um i was i thought that maybe that's actually a good thing.|s
mn017|because it it gets rid of some of the uh the noises.|rt
mn017|um you know in the the below and above the um the you know speech bandwidth.|e
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and um|fh
mn017|i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher quality recordings you would have to in fact uh use models that uh were trained on wider band data.|s
mn017|and of course we can't do that or|s
me011|what's t.i. digits?|rt
me011|i thought|s
me013|it's wide band yeah.|na
me013|it's in in fact we looked it up.|s
me011|it is wide band.|bk
me011|okay.|bk
me013|and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling.|s
me011|oh that's right.|bk
me011|i i did look that up.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|i couldn't remember whether that was t.i. digits or one of the other digit tasks.|df
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|but but i would|s
mn017|yeah.|fh
mn017|it's it's easy enough to try.|s
mn017|just run it on|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so morgan you're getting a little breath noise.|df
me013|see|%--
mn017|now uh does|%--
mn017|one one issue|s
me011|you might want to move the mike down a little bit.|cs
mn017|one issue with with that is that um the system has this uh notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation variance uh you know both in uh mean and variance normalization.|s
mn017|and also in the v.t.l. estimation.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so|fh
me011|yeah i noticed the script that extracted it.|fg
mn017|do|%--
mn017|is|%--
mn017|so does so so does does um the t.i. digits database have speakers that are known?|rt
me011|yep.|aa
me011|yep.|aa
mn017|and is there is there enough data or a comparable comparable amount of data to to what we have in our recordings here?|rt
me011|that i don't know.|no
me011|i don't know.|no
me011|i don't know how many speakers there are.|no
me011|and and how many speakers per utterance.|e
mn017|okay.|bk
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|well the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation.|fg
me013|that would|s
mn017|right uh but i'm not so much worried about the adaptation actually than than the um um the uh v.t.l. estimation.|bk
me011|right.|b
mn017|if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping uh factor.|e
mn017|so um|fh
me011|i strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do.|s
mn017|right but it's not the amount of speakers.|bk
me011|so uh|fh
mn017|it's the it's the amount of data per speaker.|e
me011|right so we we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent.|bk
mn017|right.|b
mn017|right.|b
me011|um|fh
mn017|so|fh
me011|so although i i sort of know how to run it there are a little a few details here and there that i'll have to dig out.|s
mn017|okay.|fg
mn017|the key|s
mn017|so the system actually extracts the speaker i.d. from the waveform names.|s
me011|right i saw that.|aa
mn017|and there's a there's a script and that is actually all in one script.|s
mn017|so there's this one script that parses waveform names.|s
mn017|and extracts things like the um speaker uh i.d.|s
mn017|or something that can stand in as a speaker i.d.|e
mn017|so we might have to modify that script to recognize the um speakers um in the in the uh um t.i. digits database.|cs
me011|right.|b
me011|right.|b
me011|and that uh|s
mn017|or you can fake you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings.|cs
me011|right.|b
mn017|that would be the sort of probably the safest way to do|s
me011|i might have to do that anyway to to do|s
me011|because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right.|df
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|the other thing is isn't t.i. digits isolated digits?|rt
mn017|right.|b
me011|or is that another one?|qrr
me011|i'm i looked through a bunch of the digits corpora.|df
me011|and now they're all blurring.|df
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|because one of them was literally people reading a single digit.|s
me011|and then others were connected digits.|s
me013|yeah most of t.i. digits is connected digits i think.|fg
me011|okay.|bk
me013|the i mean we had a bellcore corpus that we were using.|s
me011|maybe it's the bell gram.|s
me013|it was that's that was isolated digits.|s
me011|bell digits.|e
me011|all right.|bk
mn017|by the way i think we can improve these numbers if we care to improve them by um not starting with the switchboard models but by taking the switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting.|s
me013|um|fh
me011|yep.|aa
mn017|because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics.|df
mn017|and for the far field microphones you know to the noise.|df
mn017|and that should really improve things um further.|s
mn017|and then you use those adapted models which are not speaker adapted but sort of you know channel adapted.|s
me011|channel adapted.|2
mn017|use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation.|s
me013|yeah but the thing is uh i mean when you it depends whether you're were just using this as a a starter task for you know to get things going for conversational or if we're really interested in connected digits.|fg
me013|and i i think the answer is both.|s
mn017|well i don't know.|ng
me013|and for for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation.|s
me013|because somebody gets on the phone and says a number.|df
me013|and then you just want it.|df
me013|you don't don't uh|s
fe008|this is this that one's better.|s
mn017|right.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn017|um but you know i uh my impression was that you were actually interested in the far field microphone uh problem.|s
mn017|i mean|%--
mn017|so|fh
mn017|you want to you want to that's the obvious thing to try.|s
fe008|oh.|b
fe008|oh.|b
mn017|right?|d
mn017|then uh because you you don't have any|df
me013|right.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|that's where the most acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the the the set up here.|s
me013|right.|b
mn017|so|fh
me013|yeah so that'd be another interesting data point.|fg
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean i i guess i'm saying i don't know if we'd want to do that as the as|s
me011|other way.|t3
mn014|other way.|t3
me011|liz|%--
fe016|now you're all watching me.|t3
me011|it it clips over your ears.|s
fe016|all right.|bk
fe016|this way.|s
me011|there you go.|s
fe008|if you have a strong if you have a strong preference you could use this.|s
fe016|you're all watching.|s
fe016|this is terrible.|ba
fe008|it's just we we think it has some spikes.|df
fe008|so uh we we didn't use that one.|s
fe016|i'll get it.|rt
fe008|but you could if you want.|s
me013|yeah at any rate i don't know if|fg
fe008|i don't know.|no
fe008|and andreas your your microphone's a little bit low.|s
mn017|it is?|bk
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|aa
me013|i don't know if we want to use that as the|s
mn017|uh|fh
me011|uh it pivots.|s
fe008|so if you see the picture|cs
mn017|i|%--
me011|it it like this.|cs
fe008|and then you have to|cs
mn017|i i already adjusted this a number of times.|df
me011|uh|fh
mn017|i i|%--
me011|yeah i think these mikes are not working as well as i would like.|fg
mn017|can't quite seem to|s
mn017|yeah i think this contraption around your head is not working so well.|aa
me013|too many too many adjustments yeah.|na
me013|anyway what i was saying is that i i think i probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm that we compared all things to.|rt
fe008|that looks good.|t3
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|to uh the to have have all this all this uh adaptation.|e
me013|but i think it's an important data point if you're if|df
mn017|right.|bk
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|um|fg
me013|the other thing that that uh of course what barry was looking at was was just that.|s
me013|the near versus far.|s
me013|and yeah the adaptation would get some of that.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but i think even even if there was uh only a factor of two or something like i was saying in the email i think that's that's a big factor.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so|fh
me011|liz you could also just use the other mike if you're having problems with that one.|s
fe008|well.|fg
fe016|okay.|bk
fe008|yeah this would be okay.|fg
fe008|we we we think that this has spikes on it.|s
fe016|it's this thing's this is too big for my head.|s
fe008|so it's not as good acoustically.|s
mn017|yeah basically your ears are too big.|fg
fe008|but|fh
mn017|i mean mine are too.|bd
mn017|everybody's ears are too big for these things.|bd
fe016|no my my but this is too big for my head.|ar
mn017|uh|fh
fe016|so i mean it doesn't you know it's|s
fe008|well if you'd rather have this one then it's|cs
fe016|okay.|bk
me013|yeah.|b
me011|oh well.|ba
me013|it's great.|ba
me011|so the to get that uh pivoted this way it pivots like this.|cs
fe016|no this way.|s
me011|yeah.|bk
fe016|yeah.|aa
me011|there you go.|s
fe008|and there's a screw that you can tighten.|cs
me011|and then it|s
me011|right.|aa
fe016|right.|bk
fe016|i already tried to get it close.|s
fe008|good.|ba
me011|so if it doesn't bounce around too much that's actually good placement.|s
fe008|that looks good.|s
fe016|okay.|bk
me011|but it looks like it's going to bounce a lot.|s
me013|so where were we?|t
me013|uh yeah.|fh
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|digits.|s
me011|adaptation.|e
me013|uh adaptation non adaptation.|s
me013|um factor of two.|s
me013|um|fh
mn017|what by the way what factor of two did you|rt
me013|oh yeah i know what i was.|fg
mn017|i mean|%--
me013|oh no no.|bk
me013|it's that that we were saying you know well is how much worse is far than near you know.|s
mn017|oh okay.|bk
me013|and i mean it depends on which one you're looking at.|s
mn017|that factor of two.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but for the everybody it's little under a factor or two.|s
me013|yeah i i know what i was thinking was that maybe uh we could actually try at least looking at uh some of the the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone.|fg
me013|at least from the good one.|e
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean before i thought we'd get you know a hundred and fifty percent error or something.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but if if uh if we're getting thirty five forty percent or something um|s
fe016|actually if you run though on a close talking mike over the whole meeting during all those silences you get like four hundred percent word error.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|right i understand.|aa
me013|but doing the same kind of limited thing|df
fe016|or or some high number.|e
me013|yeah sure.|bk
me013|get all these insertions.|na
me013|but i'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people have done in switchboard evaluations or as|cs
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|where you know who the speaker is and there's no overlap?|bu
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|and you do just the far field for those regions?|bu
me013|yeah the same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from.|aa
me011|could we do exactly the same thing that we're doing now but do it with a far field mike.|bu
me013|right?|d
me013|yeah do it with one of|aa
me011|because we extract the times from the near field mike.|df
me011|but you use the acoustics from the far field mike.|s
fe016|right i understand that.|aa
fe016|i just meant that so you have three choices.|s
fe016|there's um you can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were were synchronized.|s
fe016|or you can do a forced alignment on the close talking to determine that you know within this segment these really were the times that this person was talking.|s
fe016|and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping.|s
fe016|and just front end those pieces.|s
fe016|or you can run it on the whole data.|s
fe016|which is which is you know a|s
me013|but but but how did we get the how did we determine the links uh that we're testing on in the stuff we reported?|qw
fe016|in the h.l.t. paper we took segments that are channel time aligned.|s
fe016|which is now being changed in the transcription process.|s
fe016|which is good.|s
fe016|and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here.|s
fe016|because no one else had time any words in that segment.|df
fe016|and called that non overlap.|s
me013|and|%--
me013|and that's what we were getting those numbers from.|bu
fe016|yes.|aa
me013|right.|bk
fe016|good the good numbers.|e
fe016|the bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap.|s
me013|well we could start with the good ones.|cs
me013|but anyway so i think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those.|cs
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|and in those same segments just use one of the p.z.m.'s.|cs
fe016|right so we we can do that.|bk
me013|and then you know i mean the thing is if we were getting uh what thirty five forty percent something like that on on that particular set|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|uh does it go to seventy or eighty?|qh
me013|or does it use up so much memory we can't decode it?|qh
fe016|right.|b
fe016|it might also depend on which speaker it is and how close they are to the p.z.m.|rt
me013|uh|fh
fe016|i don't know how different they are from each other.|no
mn017|you want to probably choose the p.z.m. channel that is closest to the speaker.|cs
fe016|to be best|s
me011|for this particular digit ones i just picked that one.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|well|%--
fe016|okay.|bk
mn017|oh okay.|bk
fe016|so we would then use that one too.|bu
me011|so|%--
me013|this is kind of central.|s
fe016|or|qrr
me013|you know it's so but i would i'd pick that one.|s
me013|it'll be less good for some people than for other.|s
me013|but i i'd like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing on.|cs
me011|actually|%--
me011|i actually should've picked a different one.|s
me013|right?|d
me011|because that could be why the p.d.a. is worse.|df
me011|because it's further away from most of the people reading digits.|df
mn014|it's further away yeah.|2
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|that's probably one of the reasons.|na
fe008|huh.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|well yeah you could look at i guess that p.z.m. or something.|fg
me011|yep.|b
me013|but the other is it's very uh i mean even though there's i'm sure the the the s.r.i. uh front end has some kind of pre emphasis it's it's uh still it's picking up lots of low frequency energy.|df
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so even discriminating against it i'm sure some of it's getting through.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|but yeah you're right.|na
me013|a part of it is just the distance.|na
fe016|and aren't these pretty bad microphones?|rt
me011|yep.|aa
fe016|i mean|%--
me013|well they're bad.|aap
me013|but i mean if you listen to it it sounds okay you know.|df
me011|yeah when you listen to it uh the p.z.m. and the p.d.a. yeah the p.d.a. has higher sound floor.|fg
me013|yeah.|b
me011|but not by a lot.|s
me011|it's really pretty uh pretty much the same.|e
fe016|i just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose.|s
fe016|cheap in terms of their quality.|e
fe016|so|fh
me013|well they're twenty five cents or so.|s
me011|we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in a p.d.a.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so they are they're not the p.z.m. three hundred dollar type.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me011|they're the twenty five cent.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|buy them in packs of thousand type.|s
me013|but i mean the thing is people use those little mikes for everything.|s
fe016|i see.|bk
me011|everything.|2
me013|because they're really not bad.|df
me013|i mean if you're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer they they they you know you can hear the hear the sounds just fine.|j
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right.|b
me013|you know it's|s
me013|they i mean it's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under.|s
me013|it's just that there's less quality control.|s
me013|they just you know churn them out and don't check them.|s
me013|um so|fh
me013|so that was yeah so that was interesting result.|ba
me013|so like i said the front end guys are very much interested in in this is as as well.|s
me013|and|%--
mn017|so so but where is this now?|qw
mn017|i mean what's where do we go from here?|e
mn017|i mean|%--
me011|yeah that was going to be my question.|aa
mn017|we so we have a we have a a system that works pretty well.|s
mn017|but it's not you know the system that people here are used to using to working with.|s
mn017|so what what do we do now?|qw
me013|well i think what we want to do is we want to uh|s
me013|and we've talked about this in other contexts.|s
me013|we want to have the ability to feed it different features.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and then um from the point of view of the front end research it would be uh substituting for h.t.k.|s
mn017|okay.|b
mn017|okay.|bk
me013|i think that's the key thing.|s
me013|and then if we can feed it different features then we can try all the different things that we're trying there.|s
mn017|okay all right.|b
me013|and then um uh also dave is is thinking about using the data in different ways uh to um uh explicitly work on reverberation.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful and yeah.|e
mn017|okay.|bk
mn017|so so the key thing that's missing here is basically the ability to feed you know other features into the recognizer.|bu
mn017|and also then to train the system.|bu
me013|right.|aa
me013|right.|aa
mn017|okay.|bk
mn017|and uh i don't know when chuck will be back.|no
mn017|but that's exactly what he he's going to|s
me013|he's he's sort of back.|s
me013|but he drove for fourteen hours and wasn't going to make it in today.|s
mn017|oh okay.|bk
mn017|so i think that's one of the things that he said he would be working on.|fg
mn017|um|fh
mn017|just sort of to make sure that we can do that.|s
me011|yeah.|b
mn017|and um|fh
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|right.|bk
mn017|it's uh i mean the the front end is that's in the s.r.i. recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly.|s
mn017|but it unfortunately is not designed and um like the uh icsi system is where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command.|df
mn017|so the what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to uh dump out um|s
mn017|you know if you want to use some new features you have to dump them into individual files.|s
mn017|and give those files to the recognizer.|s
me011|we do we tend to do that anyway.|s
mn017|okay.|bk
me011|oh.|fh
me011|so although you you can pipe it as well we tend to do it that way.|s
me011|because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep redoing it over and over.|df
mn017|oh okay.|bk
mn017|all right.|bk
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|yeah so i've i|fg
me011|so that's exactly what the p. file is for.|s
me013|yeah.|fg
mn017|yeah the the the cumbersome thing is is um is that you actually have to dump out little little files.|fg
fe016|uh|b
mn017|so for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|just like like as if there were these waveform segments.|s
mn017|but instead you have sort of feature file segments.|s
mn017|but you know|s
mn017|so|fh
me013|cool.|bk
me013|okay so the the the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments?|fg
fe016|oh.|bk
fe016|yes we have|aa
fe016|i don't know.|bd
fe016|did you want to talk about it?|cs
fe016|or|qrr
fe016|i can give a i was just telling this to jane.|s
fe016|and and we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring.|s
fe016|and um|fh
fe016|some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition.|s
fe016|which is a um i think was both a a pruning problem.|s
fe016|and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations.|s
fe016|and so we tried both of these things.|s
fe016|we tried saying|s
fe016|i don't know.|bk
fe016|i got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data that when people talk their words are usually chunked together.|s
fe016|it's not that they say one word and then there's a bunch of words together.|s
fe016|they're might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels.|rt
fe016|but in general if there's like five or six words and one word's far away from it that's probably wrong on average.|s
fe016|so um|fh
fe016|and then also the pruning of course was too too severe.|s
mn017|so that's actually interesting.|ba
mn017|the pruning was the same value that we used for recognition.|s
mn017|and we had lowered that we had used tighter pruning after liz ran some experiments showing that you know it runs slower.|s
mn017|and there's no real difference in|s
me011|no gain.|2
fe016|actually it was better with slightly better or about|ng
mn017|right.|aa
fe016|it was the same with tighter pruning.|e
mn017|so for free recognition this the lower pruning value is better.|s
mn017|you|%--
fe016|it's probably because the recognition's just bad at a point where it's bad enough that that you don't lose anything.|s
mn017|correct.|aa
mn017|right.|b
mn017|um but it turned out for for to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly.|fg
fe016|right.|b
me013|huh.|b
mn017|um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment um in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker.|fh
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|um so that was one big factor that helped improve things.|s
mn017|and then the other thing was that|s
mn017|you know as liz said the we enforce the fact that uh the foreground speech has to be continuous.|s
mn017|it cannot be you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech.|e
mn017|you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end.|e
fe016|yeah i mean yeah it isn't always true.|fg
fe016|and i think what we really want is some clever way to do this.|cs
fe016|where um you know from the data or from maybe some hand corrected alignments from transcribers that|s
fe016|things like words that do occur just by themselves alone like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|those would be able to do that.|s
fe008|sorry.|fa
fe016|but the rest would be constrained.|s
fe016|so i think we have a version that's pretty good for the native speakers.|s
fe016|i don't know yet about the non native speakers.|no
fe016|and um|fh
fe016|we basically also made noise models for the different sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together.|s
fe016|um so and then there's a background speech model.|fh
fe016|and we also|s
fe016|there was some neat or interesting cases.|s
fe016|like there's one meeting where um jose's giving a presentation.|s
fe016|and he's talking about um the word mixed signal.|s
fe016|and someone didn't understand uh that you were saying mixed.|s
fe016|i think morgan.|s
mn005|yeah yeah.|b
fe016|and so your speech was saying something about mixed signal.|s
fe016|and the next turn was a lot of people saying mixed.|s
fe016|like he means mixed signal or i think it's mixed.|e
fe016|and the word mixed in this segment occurs like a bunch of times.|s
fe016|and chuck's on the lapel here.|s
fe016|and he also says mixed.|s
fe016|but it's at the last one.|rt
fe016|and of course the aligner aligns it everywhere else to everybody else's mixed.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|because there's no adaptation yet.|df
fe016|so there's i think there's some issues about|s
fe016|we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker.|cs
fe016|but i guess andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker.|s
fe016|and that's actually a little bit of a funky model.|ba
fe016|like it gives you some weird alignments.|s
fe016|just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker.|df
mn017|oh|fg
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|oh.|b
fe016|so there's some things there.|s
fe016|especially when you get lots of the same words uh occurring in the.|df
mn017|well the|fg
mn017|i i think you can do better by uh cloning|s
mn017|so we have a reject phone.|s
mn017|and you and what we wanted to try with you know once we have this paper written and have a little more time uh cloning that reject model.|s
mn017|and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground.|s
mn017|like fragments and stuff.|e
mn017|and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker.|s
fe016|right i mean in general we actually|fg
mn017|and|%--
fe016|right now the words like partial words are reject models.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and you normally allow those to match to any word.|s
fe016|but then the background speech was also a reject model.|s
fe016|and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between.|s
fe016|you know it needs to differentiate between the two.|s
fe016|so just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues.|s
mn017|right.|b
fe016|and another one is turns like people starting with well i think|s
fe016|and someone else is well how about|s
fe016|so the word well is in this in this segment multiple times.|s
fe016|and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it.|s
fe016|but then that constraint of sort of uh proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general.|s
me011|is the proximity constraint a hard constraint?|qy
me011|or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance or|qrr
mn017|we we didn't|s
mn017|no.|ar
fe016|right now it's a kluge.|s
mn017|we|%--
mn017|okay.|fg
mn017|we it's straightforward to actually just have a a penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it.|rt
mn017|but um we just didn't have time to play with you know tuning yet another yet another parameter.|df
me011|the level.|2
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|and really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a we don't have ground truth for these.|s
mn017|so we would need a hand marked um word level alignments.|cs
mn017|or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech you know between the speakers.|cs
mn017|um and then use that as a reference.|fh
mn017|and tune the parameters of the of the model uh to to get the best performance.|s
fe016|yeah.|aa
me013|given i i mean i i i was going to ask you anyway uh how you assessed that things were better?|qw
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|i looked at them.|s
fe016|i spent two days um in waves.|s
me013|okay.|bk
fe016|oh it was painful.|ba
fe016|because the thing is you know the alignments share a lot in common.|df
fe016|so|fh
fe016|and you're you're looking at these segments where there's a lot of speech.|s
fe016|i mean a lot of them have a lot of words.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|not by every speaker.|s
fe016|but by some speaker there's a lot of words.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|no not|s
fe016|i mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words.|ba
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|but altogether you'll see a lot of words up there.|df
fe016|and so the reject is also mapping and pauses.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|so i looked at them all in waves.|rt
fe016|and just lined up all the alignments.|s
fe016|and at first it sort of looked like a mess.|s
fe016|and then the more i looked at it i thought okay well it's moving these words leftward.|s
fe016|and you know it wasn't that bad.|ba
fe016|it was just doing certain things wrong.|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|but i don't you know have time to to look at all of them.|df
fe016|and it would be really useful to have like a a transcriber who could use waves.|cs
fe016|um just mark like the beginning and end of the foreground speaker's real words.|cs
fe016|like the beginning of the first word the end of the last word.|e
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|and then we could you know do some adjustments.|s
fe008|i okay.|bk
fe008|i have to ask you something.|s
fe008|because if we could benefit from what you did incorporate that into the present transcripts that would help.|cs
mn017|no.|ar
fe008|and then um the other thing is i believe that i did|s
fe008|so one of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber.|s
fe008|and then i hand marked it myself so that we do have uh the beginning and ending of individual utterances.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe008|um i didn't do it word level.|s
fe008|but but in terms|s
fe008|so i so for for one of the n.s.a. groups.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and also i went back to the original one that i first transcribed and and did it uh uh utterance by utterance for that particular one.|s
fe008|so i think you do have|s
fe008|if that's a sufficient unit i think that you do have hand marking for that.|s
fe008|but it'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your waves stuff.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
mn017|we don't care what what tool you use.|s
fe016|yeah i mean if if you can um if you want to|fg
fe008|okay.|bk
fe008|i used it in transcriber.|s
mn017|uh|%--
fe008|and it's it's in the|s
fe016|well jane and i were just in terms of the tool talking about this.|s
fe016|i guess sue had had some reactions.|s
fe016|you know interface wise if you're looking at speech you want to be able to know really where the words are.|s
fe008|yeah that's right.|aa
fe016|and so we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like.|s
fe008|middle of the word or|s
fe016|um and see if you can maybe incorporate it into the transcriber tool some way.|cs
fe016|or|fh
fe008|well i i'm thinking just incorporating it into the representation.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe008|i mean if it's if it's|s
fe016|you mean like yeah word start insights.|s
fe008|if you have start points if you have like time tags|s
fe016|right.|b
fe008|which is what i assume.|rt
fe008|isn't that what what you|qy
fe008|well see adam would be|s
mn017|yeah whatever you use.|fg
mn017|i mean we convert it to this format that the um nist scoring tool uh c.t.m. conversation time marked file.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|and and then that's the that's what the|s
me011|i think transcriber uh outputs c.t.m.|s
fe008|if it|%--
fe008|okay.|bk
me011|i think so.|am
fe008|so you would know this more than i would.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|b
fe016|so i mean|s
fe008|it seems like she if she's if she's moving time marks around|s
fe008|since our representation in transcriber uses time marks it seems like there should be some way of of using that benefitting from that.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|yeah it the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the words.|fg
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|you would be able to like have the words sort of located in time.|s
fe016|if you wanted to do that.|s
me013|so so if we even just had a a it sounds like we we almost do.|rt
fe016|so|fh
me013|uh if we we have two.|bk
fe008|we have two.|s
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|just uh trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that.|cs
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|you could actually get something um uh uh get an objective measure.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh|fh
fe016|you mean on on the hand marked um|bu
fe016|so we we only i only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose.|s
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|i think m.r. four.|e
fe016|just randomly um|s
fe016|and|fh
mn017|actually not randomly.|nd
fe016|not randomly.|m
mn017|we knew we knew that it had these insertion errors from.|df
fe016|it had sort of average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|and it was a meeting recorder meeting.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|but yeah we should try to use what you have.|s
fe016|i did rerun recognition on your new version of m.r. one.|s
fe008|oh good.|ba
fe016|i i mean the the one with dan ellis in it and eric.|s
fe008|good.|ba
fe008|uhhuh yeah exactly yeah yeah.|bk
me001|i don't think that was the new version.|ng
fe016|um|fh
fe016|that|%--
fe016|yeah actually it wasn't the new new.|aa
fe008|okay.|bk
fe016|it was the medium new.|s
fe016|but but we would we should do the the latest version.|cs
fe008|okay.|bk
me001|yeah.|bk
me001|you did you adjust the the utterance times um for each channel?|rt
fe016|it was the one from last week.|s
fe008|yes.|aa
fe008|yes i did.|aa
fe008|and furthermore i found that there were a certain number where not not a lot but several times i actually moved an utterance from adam's channel to dan's or from dan's to adam's.|s
fe008|so there was some speaker|s
fe008|and the reason was because i transcribed that at a point before uh before we had the multiple audio available.|s
fe008|so i couldn't switch between the audio.|s
fe008|i i transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely.|s
fe008|which meant in overlaps i was at a at a terrific disadvantage.|s
fe016|right.|b
fe016|right.|b
fe008|in addition it was before the channelized uh possibility was there.|s
fe008|and finally i did it using the speakers of my um of you know off the c.p.u. on my on my machine.|s
fe008|because i didn't have a headphone.|df
fe008|so it like i mean|s
fe016|right.|b
fe008|yeah i i mean in retrospect it would've been good to have i should've gotten a headphone.|s
fe008|but in any case um this is this was transcribed in a in a uh less optimal way than than the ones that came after it.|s
fe008|and i was able to you know and this meant that there were some speaker identifications.|s
me001|well i know there were some speaker labelling problems um after interruptions.|s
fe008|which were changes|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|fixed that.|s
me001|is that what you're referring to?|rt
me001|i mean because there's this one instance when for example you're running down the stairs.|rt
fe008|oh well|s
me001|i remember this meeting really well.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me001|right.|b
fe016|don don has had he knows he can just read it like a play.|s
me001|it's a|s
me001|yeah i've i've i'm very well acquainted with this meeting.|aa
me001|yeah i can|aa
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|and then she said and then he said.|s
me001|yeah i know it by heart.|fg
me001|so um there's one point when you're running down the stairs.|rt
fe008|uhoh!|fe
me001|right?|d
me001|and like there's an interruption.|s
me001|you interrupt somebody.|s
me001|but then there's no line after that.|s
me001|for example there's no speaker identification after that line.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me001|is that what you're talking about?|rt
me001|or were there mislabelings as far as like the adam was?|qrr
fe008|that was fixed um before.|s
fe008|i think i think i understood that pretty|s
me001|yeah because i thought i let you know about that.|fg
fe008|thank you for mentioning.|ft
me001|yeah.|fw
fe008|yeah no that that i think went away a couple of versions ago.|s
me001|okay.|bk
me001|but you're actually saying that certain uh speakers were mis identified.|s
fe008|but it's good to know.|s
fe008|yeah so with under um uh listening to the mixed channel there were times when as surprising as that is i got adam's voice confused with dan's and vice versa.|aa
me001|okay.|bk
fe008|not for long utterances.|bd
me001|okay.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|but just a couple of places.|bd
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and embedded in overlaps.|s
fe008|the other thing that was interesting to me was that i picked up a lot of um backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal.|s
fe008|which you know i mean you not not too surprising.|s
fe016|right.|b
fe008|but the other thing that|s
fe008|i i hadn't thought about this.|s
fe008|but i i wanted to raise this when you were uh with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially.|s
fe008|but that's|s
fe008|when i was looking at these backchannels they were turning up usually very often in well i won't say usually but anyway very often i picked them up in a channel which was the person who had asked a question.|s
fe008|so like someone says and have you done the so-and-so.|s
fe008|and then there would be backchannels.|s
fe008|but it would be the person who asked the question.|s
fe008|other people weren't really doing much backchanneling.|s
fe008|and you know sometimes you have the yeah uhhuh.|s
fe016|well that's interesting.|ba
fe008|i mean it wouldn't be perfect.|bd
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|but but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when when you're somehow involved in the topic.|df
fe016|no that's really interesting.|ar
fe008|and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|well|fg
mn017|i think|s
fe016|that's interesting.|ba
mn017|no i think it's actually i think what's going on is backchanneling is something that happens in two party conversations.|ar
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and if you ask someone a question you essentially initiating a little two party conversation.|e
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|well yeah when we looked at this.|s
mn017|so then you're so and then you're expected to backchannel.|s
fe008|exactly.|aa
mn017|because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody.|df
fe008|exactly.|aa
fe008|exactly my point.|s
mn017|yeah.|bk
fe008|and so this is the expectation thing that uh uh|s
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|uhhuh.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|right.|b
fe008|just the dyadic|s
fe008|but in addition you know if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad but they might also give backchannels to verify what what the answer is that this that the the answerer's given|s
me013|i tell you i say i say uhhuh a lot.|s
fe016|right.|b
fe016|it's|%--
fe008|there you go.|s
fe016|well but it's interesting.|s
fe016|because uh|df
me013|while people are talking to each other.|e
fe008|there you go.|s
fe016|but there are fewer i think there are fewer uhhuh.|ng
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|i mean just from we were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment.|s
fe016|you know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words.|s
fe008|oh yeah.|bk
fe016|and uhhuh is not as frequent.|s
fe016|as it sort of would be in switchboard.|s
fe016|if you looked at just a word frequency list of one word short utterances.|e
fe016|and yeah is way up there.|s
fe016|but not uhhuh.|s
fe016|and so i was thinking|s
fe016|it's not like you're being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting.|s
fe016|and uh that's all i'll stop there.|s
fe016|because i think what you say makes a lot of sense.|df
fe008|well that's right.|na
fe008|and that would|s
fe008|well|%--
fe016|but it was sort of|s
fe008|and what you say is the is the uh other side of this.|s
fe008|which is that you know so there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels when a question has been asked.|e
fe008|and and these|s
fe016|right.|b
fe016|there's just probably less backchanneling in general.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|so that's good news really.|ba
fe016|even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting.|s
fe016|but we'll find out anyway.|s
fe016|we were i guess the other thing we're we're i should say is that we're going to um try compare this type of overlap analysis to switchboard.|s
mn017|and callhome.|e
fe016|where|s
fe016|and callhome.|m
fe016|where we have both sides so that we can try to answer this question of you know is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in switchboard?|qrr
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and we don't know what people are doing.|s
fe016|try to create a paper out of that.|s
me013|yeah i mean you folks have probably already told me.|fg
me013|but were were you intending to do a eurospeech submission?|qy
me013|or|qrr
fe016|um you mean the one due tomorrow?|bu
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|yeah well we're still like writing the scripts for doing the research.|bk
fe016|and we will yes we're going to try.|na
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and i was telling don do not take this as an example of how people should work.|s
me013|do as i say.|s
me001|that's|s
fe016|so we will try.|fg
me013|don't do as i do.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|well|fg
fe016|it'll probably be a little late.|s
me011|it is different.|s
fe016|but i'm going to try it.|s
me011|in previous years eurospeech only had the abstract due by now.|s
me011|not the full paper.|s
me001|right.|b
fe016|right.|aa
me011|and so all our timing was off.|s
me011|i've given up on trying to do digits.|s
me011|i just don't think that what i have so far makes a eurospeech paper.|s
fe016|well i'm we may be in the same position.|rt
fe016|and i figured we'll try.|s
fe016|because that'll at least get us to the point where we have we have this really nice database format that andreas and i were working out that|s
fe016|it it's not very fancy.|s
fe016|it's just a ascii line by line format.|s
fe016|but it does give you information.|s
mn017|it's the it's the spurt format.|s
fe016|it yeah we're calling these spurts after chafe.|s
fe016|i was trying to find what's a word for a continuous region with pauses around it.|df
fe008|huh.|b
me013|yeah i know that the telecom people use use spurt for that.|fg
fe008|good.|b
fe016|they do?|bu
mn017|oh.|bk
me013|yes.|aa
fe016|oh.|bk
fe016|oh.|bk
me013|and that's i mean i i was using that for a while when i was doing the rate of speech stuff.|s
fe016|i would|s
me013|because i because i looked up in some books and i found okay i want to find a spurt in which|df
fe016|uh right.|bk
fe016|it's just like defined by the acoustics.|s
me013|and because because it's another question about how many pauses they put in between them.|s
me011|horrible.|ba
fe016|right.|b
me013|but how fast do they do the words within the spurt?|qo
fe016|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me001|you know burst also?|bu
me011|it's going to|s
fe016|well that's what we were calling spurt.|s
me011|burst.|s
me001|isn't burst is used also?|rt
fe016|so|fh
me011|spurt has the horrible name overloading with other with hardware at icsi.|s
me013|here.|2
me013|just very locally yeah.|na
me013|but but that just|s
fe016|well well chafe had this i think it was chafe or somebody had a the word spurt originally.|s
mn005|here|%
fe016|and so i|s
fe008|actually|%--
fe016|but that's good to know.|ba
fe016|was it's chafe?|qy
mn017|so maybe we should talk|cs
fe008|well see i know sue wrote about spurts of development.|s
fe016|maybe it was sue|s
fe008|but in any case i think it's a good term.|ba
me011|huh!|b
fe008|and uh|fh
fe016|so we have spurts and we have spurt-ify dot shell and spurt-ify.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|and maybe maybe chafe did.|s
mn017|uh|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|so|%--
fe008|i know i know chafe dealt with|s
fe016|and then it's got all it's a verb now.|s
me001|that's cool.|ba
mn017|uh|%--
fe008|chafe speaks about intonation units.|s
fe016|yes right.|aa
fe008|but maybe he speaks about spurts as well.|s
fe008|and i just don't know.|no
fe008|yeah go ahead.|co
mn017|so what we're doing|s
me011|i've heard burst also.|s
mn017|uh this this is just maybe someone has some some ideas about how to do it better.|bd
me001|huh.|b
mn017|but we so we're taking these uh alignments from the individual channels.|s
mn017|we're|s
mn017|from each alignment we're producing uh one of these c.t.m. files.|s
mn017|which essentially has it's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration.|s
fe008|great.|b
mn017|and and and of course|s
fe016|it looks like a waves label file almost right?|s
mn017|right but it has one the first column has the meeting name.|aa
fe016|it's just|s
mn017|so it could actually contain several meetings.|s
mn017|um|fh
mn017|and the second column is the channel.|s
mn017|third column is the um start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words.|s
mn017|and then we're|s
mn017|um|fh
mn017|okay then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the uh tags.|fg
mn017|for like where where sentence ends of sentence.|e
mn017|question marks.|e
mn017|um various other things.|fh
fe016|yeah these are things that we had don|fg
mn017|uh|fh
fe016|so don sort of um propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber.|s
mn017|right.|b
fe016|so whether it was like question mark or period or um you know comma and things like that.|s
fe016|and we kept the disfluency dashes uh kept those in because we sort of want to know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|so so those are actually sort of retro fitted into the time alignment.|s
fe016|overlaps.|bsc
fe016|or|fh
mn017|and then we merge all the alignments from the various channels.|s
mn017|and we sort them by time.|s
mn017|and then there's a then there's a process where you now determine the spurts.|s
mn017|that is actually no you do that before you merge the various channels.|s
mn017|so you you identify by some criterion.|s
mn017|which is pause length.|s
mn017|you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts.|s
mn017|and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and then you merge everything in terms of you know linearizing the sequence based on the time marks.|s
mn017|and then you extract the individual channels again.|s
mn017|but this time you know where the other people start and end talking.|s
mn017|you know where their spurts start and end.|s
mn017|and so you extract the individual channels uh one spurt by spurt as it were.|s
mn017|um and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps.|s
mn017|so you you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers' speech.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|uh i mean i think that's actually really useful also.|s
mn017|and|%--
fe016|because even if you weren't studying overlaps if you want to get a transcription for the far field mikes how are you going to know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other?|df
fe016|you have to be able to get a transcript like like this anyway just for doing far field recognition.|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|you know it's it's sort of|s
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|i it's just an issue we haven't dealt with before.|s
fe016|how you time align things that are overlapping anyway.|e
mn017|so|fg
fe008|that's wonderful.|ba
me011|well|%--
mn017|and and we|s
fe016|i mean i never thought about it before.|s
me011|yes.|aap
mn017|in|%--
fe016|but|%--
me011|i mean when i came up with the original data suggested data format based on the transcription graph there's capability of doing that sort of thing in there.|s
fe016|right.|aa
fe008|uhhuh.|aa
fe016|but you can't get it directly from the transcription.|s
mn017|right.|b
fe008|yeah that's right.|na
mn017|well this is this is just|s
fe016|yeah this is like a poor man's formatting version.|bk
fe016|but it's you know it's clean.|s
fe016|it's just not fancy.|e
me011|right.|b
mn017|well there's lots of little things.|s
fe016|um|fh
mn017|it's like there're twelve different scripts which you run.|s
mn017|and then at the end you have what you want.|s
mn017|but um|fh
mn017|at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information.|s
mn017|all we care about is whether that there's a certain word was overlapped by someone else's word.|s
mn017|so you sort of at that point you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap.|s
mn017|because we figure that's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper.|df
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|but if you wanted to do a more fine-grained analysis and say you know how far into the word is the overlap you could do that.|s
mn017|it's just it'll just require more|s
fe016|yeah.|aa
fe016|just sort of huge.|ba
mn017|you know slightly different.|s
fe008|what's interesting is it's exactly what um in discussing with um sue about this.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|um she um indicated that that you know that's very important for overlap analysis.|s
fe016|yeah it's it's nice to know.|aa
mn017|right.|b
fe016|and also i think as a human like i don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur.|s
fe016|so i can have two foreground speakers.|s
fe016|you know morgan and um adam and jane could all be talking.|e
fe016|and i could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time.|s
fe016|and then look where they are relative to each other.|s
fe016|and that's not really what i heard.|s
fe008|and that's another thing she said.|s
fe016|because it's just hard to do.|df
fe008|this is this is bever's bever's effect.|s
fe008|when where in psycholinguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases as to what they hear.|s
fe016|yeah.|aa
fe016|it's sort of|s
fe008|that that not the best|s
fe016|yeah you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point.|aa
fe016|and then you can bring in the other person.|s
fe016|so it's actually not even possible i think for any person to listen to a mixed signal.|s
fe016|even equalize and make sure that they have all the words in the right order.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so i guess we'll try to write this eurospeech paper.|s
fe008|superb.|ba
fe016|i mean we will write it.|s
fe016|whether they accept it late or not i don't know.|no
fe016|um and the good thing is that we have it's sort of a beginning of what don can use to link the prosodic features from each file to each other.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah that's the good thing about these|bk
mn017|plus|s
fe016|so|fh
mn005|huh?|br
fe016|you know might as well.|s
fe016|i otherwise we won't get the work done on our deadline.|df
mn017|i don't know|s
mn017|i mean jane likes to look at data.|rt
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|maybe you know you could you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting.|cs
mn017|i don't know.|bd
me013|yeah.|bk
fe008|well what i'm thinking is|s
me013|no it's that's the good thing about these paper deadlines and uh you know class projects and and things like that.|ba
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right.|b
fe008|well my|s
mn017|well the other thing that that that that you usually don't tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that um you know strictly enforced.|s
me013|because you you really get|df
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|forces you to do the work.|2
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|exactly.|aa
me011|strict.|2
mn017|because the|df
me013|oh now it's out in the public.|s
me013|this this this secret information.|e
mn017|because|df
fe008|i think we can|s
me013|yeah.|bk
mn017|nah|s
fe016|right.|b
me011|no.|ar
fe016|so|%--
me013|no.|ar
fe008|nah.|%
mn017|because these the conference organizers actually have an interest in getting lots of submissions.|df
fe016|right.|b
mn017|i mean a a monetary interest.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|so um|fh
me013|that's that's true.|na
fe008|and good ones.|s
fe008|good ones.|r
mn017|and good|s
fe008|which sometimes means a little extra time.|s
me013|that's|%--
mn017|right.|b
mn017|well|%--
me013|that's true.|aa
mn017|that's another issue.|s
mn017|but|fh
me013|by by the way this is totally unfair you may you may feel.|s
me013|but the the uh the morning meeting folks actually have an an extra month or so.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn014|yep.|b
me011|yep the aurora there's a special aurora|fg
mn017|when|%--
fe016|uh|%--
me013|there's a special aurora session.|s
me013|and the aurora people involved in aurora have till uh early may or something to turn in their paper.|s
fe016|oh.|bk
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|oh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|well then you can just|s
fe016|oh well maybe we'll submit to actually|bk
mn017|maybe you can submit the digits paper on for the aurora session.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|aa
fe016|yeah.|aa
me011|oh i could!|fe
me013|if it|s
fe016|yeah.|aa
me011|i could submit that to aurora.|s
mn017|yeah.|aap
me013|well|%--
me011|that would be pretty pretty|s
me013|it has|s
fe016|yeah.|aa
me011|that wouldn't work.|s
me013|no it wouldn't work.|aa
me011|it's not aurora.|df
me013|it's it's not the aurora|m
me013|i mean it it's it's actually the aurora task.|e
fe016|maybe they'll get|s
me011|aurora's very specific.|s
fe016|well maybe it won't be after this deadline extension.|s
mn017|but but the people i mean|s
mn017|a a paper that is not on aurora would probably be more interesting at that point.|s
fe016|maybe they'll|s
mn017|because everybody's so sick and tired of the aurora task.|df
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|oh i thought you meant this was just the digits section.|s
me011|i didn't know you meant it was aurora digits.|df
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|well no if you if you have it's to if you discuss some relation to the aurora task.|cs
mn017|like if you use the same|cs
me013|this is not the aurora task.|nd
me013|so they just do a little grep for|s
fe016|do uh|%--
mn017|um|fh
fe016|do not do not we are not setting a good example.|s
mn017|well a relation other than negation maybe.|s
fe016|this is not a|s
mn017|um|fh
mn017|so|fh
mn017|i don't know.|bd
fe016|anyway|s
fe016|but the good thing is this does|s
me011|well i don't know.|no
me011|i mean you could you could do a paper on what's wrong with the aurora task by comparing it to other ways of doing it.|s
mn017|how well does an aurora system do on on you know on digits collected in a in this environment?|cs
me011|different way.|2
me011|yeah.|bk
mn017|yeah.|aa
me013|maybe.|am
mn017|maybe.|bk
me011|pretty hokey.|ba
me013|i think it's a little farfetched.|na
me013|nah i mean the thing is aurora's pretty closed community.|df
me011|yep.|aa
me013|i mean you know the people who were involved in the the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who who made it above a certain threshold in the first round.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|it's very specific.|s
me013|uh in ninety nine.|s
me013|and it's it's sort of a it's|s
mn017|well that's maybe why they don't know that they have a crummy system.|s
me013|not like a|s
mn017|i mean a crummy back end.|e
mn017|no i mean i mean seriously.|df
mn017|if you if you have a very|s
mn017|no i'm sorry.|df
fe016|uh beep!|fe
mn017|no i didn't mean anybody any particular system.|df
me011|i mean|s
mn017|i meant this h.t.k. back end.|e
mn017|if they|s
me013|oh you don't like h.t. k?|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
mn017|i don't i don't have any stock in h.t.k. or entropic or anything.|no
me013|no i mean this it's the h.t.k. that is trained on a very limited amount of data.|s
me011|it's it's very specific.|s
mn017|right.|aa
me013|yeah.|bk
mn017|but so if you but maybe you should you know consider more using more data.|cs
mn017|or i mean|s
me013|oh yeah i i really think that that's true.|aa
mn017|if if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and don't look left and right then you're going to|s
me013|and they|s
me011|but they they had|nd
me013|but|%--
me011|they had something very specific in mind when they designed it right?|df
mn017|right.|bk
me013|well|%--
me011|and so so you can you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do.|rt
me011|but you know they they they had something specific.|s
me013|but one of the reasons i have chuck's messing around with with the back end that you're not supposed to touch|rt
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean for the evaluations yes we'll run a version that hasn't been touched.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but uh one of the reasons i have him messing around with that because i think it's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to.|s
me013|people always say very glibly that if you show improvement on a bad system that doesn't mean anything.|s
me013|because it may not be show uh because you know it doesn't tell you anything about the good system.|df
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and i i've always sort of felt that that depends.|s
me013|you know that if some if you're actually are getting at something that has some conceptual substance to it it will port.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and in fact most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute best system at some level.|s
me013|but of course sometimes it doesn't uh port.|s
me013|so i think that's that's an interesting question.|s
me013|if we're getting three percent error on uh uh english uh native speakers um using the aurora system and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two do those same improvements bring uh you know the s.r.i. system from one point three to you know to point eight|qo
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|zero.|2
me013|well|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|you know so that's that's something we can test.|rt
mn017|right.|aa
me013|so|fh
me013|anyway|s
mn017|okay.|bk
me013|i think we've we've covered that one up extremely well.|tc
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn017|whew!|fe
me013|okay.|bk
me013|so um|fg
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|so so we'll you know maybe you guys will have have one.|s
me013|uh you you and uh and dan have have a paper that that's going in.|s
mn014|yeah.|aa
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|you know that's that's pretty solid on the segmentation stuff.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|i will send you the the final version.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|and the aurora folks here will will definitely get something in on aurora.|s
mn014|which is not|s
mn017|actually this this um so there's another paper.|s
me013|so|fh
mn017|it's a eurospeech paper but not related to meetings.|s
mn017|but it's on digits.|s
mn017|so um|fh
mn017|uh a colleague at s.r.i. developed a improved version of m.m.i.e. training.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and he tested it mostly on digits.|s
mn017|because it's sort of a you know it doesn't take weeks to train it.|df
me013|right.|b
mn017|um|fh
mn017|and got some very impressive results um with you know discriminative uh gaussian training um you know like um error rates go from i don't know in very noisy environment like from|s
mn017|uh uh|fh
mn017|i now i okay now i have the order of|s
mn017|i'm not sure about the order of magnitude.|no
mn017|was it like from ten percent to eight percent or from you know point you know from one percent to point eight percent?|qr
me013|it got it got better.|s
mn017|i mean it's a|s
mn017|it got better.|bk
mn014|yeah.|bk
mn017|that's the important thing.|ba
me013|yeah yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|bk
me011|hey that's the same percent relative.|fg
mn017|but it's|s
me011|so|fh
mn017|yeah right.|aa
me013|yeah.|aa
mn017|it's uh something in|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|bk
me011|twenty percent relative gain.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|yeah.|bk
me013|um let's see.|fg
me013|i think the only thing we had left was unless somebody else|t
me013|well there's a couple things.|s
me013|uh one is anything that um anybody has to say about saturday?|qo
me013|anything we should do in prep for saturday?|e
me013|um|fh
me013|i guess everybody knows about|s
me013|i mean um mari was asking was trying to come up with something like an agenda.|df
me013|and we're sort of fitting around people's times a bit.|s
me013|but um clearly when we actually get here we'll move things around this as we need to.|s
me013|but|fh
mn014|okay.|bk
me013|so you can't absolutely count on it.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|but but uh|fh
fe016|are we meeting in here probably?|rt
fe016|or|qrr
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|okay.|bk
me013|that was my thought.|e
me013|i think this is|s
mn017|are we recording it?|rt
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|we won't have enough microphones.|df
me013|no i i hadn't intended to.|ar
fe016|but|fh
fe016|there's no way.|nd
mn017|okay.|bk
me013|we we want to i mean they're there's going to be uh jeff katrin mari and two students.|s
me013|so there's five from there.|s
me011|and brian.|2
mn017|but you know|s
me013|and brian's coming.|m
me013|so that's six.|rt
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|and plus all of us.|s
mn017|can use the oprah mike.|cs
me013|uh|fh
fe016|depends how fast you can throw it.|j
me011|it seems like too many too much coming and going.|s
fe016|it's just|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|yeah.|aa
me013|well|%--
fe016|we don't even have enough channel|s
mn017|because it would be a different kind of meeting.|df
mn014|yeah.|bk
mn017|that's what i'm|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|well|%--
mn017|but|fh
me013|i hadn't really thought of it.|no
mn017|maybe just maybe not the whole day.|cs
me013|but|%--
mn017|but just you know maybe some i mean|cs
me013|maybe part of it.|cs
mn017|part of it?|br
me013|maybe part of it.|cs
me011|make everyone read digits.|cs
me013|at the same time.|2
me011|at the same time.|m
mn017|please.|ng
fe016|at the same time.|m
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|we|%--
me013|i don't know.|no
fe016|that's their initiation into our|j
me011|into our our our cult.|2
fe016|yeah our yeah our|aa
mn017|maybe the sections that are not right you know after lunch when everybody's still munching.|cs
mn017|and|fh
me013|okay.|bk
fe016|so can you send out a schedule once you know it|qy
me013|well|fg
me013|okay yeah i guess i sent it around a little bit.|bk
fe016|is is there a|qy
fe016|there's a|s
me013|but|fh
fe016|is it changed now or|qrr
me013|i hadn't heard back from mari after i i uh brought up the point about andreas's schedule.|s
me013|so um maybe when i get back there'll be some some mail from her.|s
fe016|okay.|bk
me013|so i'll make a|s
fe008|i'm looking forward to seeing your representation.|s
fe008|that'd be uh|s
fe016|and we should get the two meetings from|s
fe008|i'd like to see that.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|i mean i know about the first meeting.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|but the other one that you did.|s
fe016|the n.s.a. one.|e
fe016|which we hadn't done because we weren't running recognition on it.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|because the non native speaker|df
fe016|there were five non native speakers.|df
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|i see.|bk
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|but it would be useful for the to see what we get with that one.|s
fe008|great.|ba
fe016|so|fh
fe008|okay.|bk
fe008|it's uh two thousand eleven twenty one one thousand?|d
fe016|yeah three.|aa
fe016|right.|aa
fe016|so|fh
fe008|great.|ba
fe008|i sent email when i finished the that one.|s
fe016|n.s.a. three i think.|s
fe008|that was sort of|s
fe008|yeah that's right that's right.|aa
fe008|that's much simpler.|ba
fe016|i don't know what they said.|no
fe016|but i know the number.|df
me013|that part's definitely going to confuse somebody who looks at these later.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|um|fh
me013|i mean this is we're recording secret n.s.a. meetings.|df
mn017|not the|%--
me013|i mean it's|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|uh|fh
fe008|yeah not that n.s.a.|nd
mn017|the the|%--
me013|it's network services and applications.|s
fe016|they are hard to understand.|na
mn017|wait.|co
fe016|they're very uh out there.|e
mn017|the|%--
fe016|i have no idea what they're talking about.|no
mn017|the um|fg
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|the other good thing about the alignments is that um it's not always the machine's fault if it doesn't work.|rt
mn017|so you can actually find um|s
fe016|it's the person's fault.|j
mn017|problem uh|s
fe016|it's morgan's fault.|j
mn017|you can find|s
mn017|you can find uh problems with with the transcripts.|s
me013|it's always morgan's fault.|j
mn017|um you know|fh
me011|oh.|bk
mn017|and go back and fix them.|s
fe016|yeah.|aa
mn017|but|fh
fe016|there are some cases like where the the wrong speaker uh these not a lot but where the the wrong person the the speech is attached to the wrong speaker.|s
fe016|and you can tell that when you run it.|s
fe016|or at least you can get clues to it.|s
fe008|interesting.|b
fe008|i guess it does|s
fe016|so these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals like what you have.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|it also raises the possibility of um using that kind of representation i mean i don't know this would be something we'd want to check but maybe using that representation for data entry.|cs
fe008|and then displaying it on the channelized uh representation.|cs
fe008|because it i think that the i mean my my preference in terms of like looking at the data is to see it in this kind of musical score format.|df
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and also you know sue's preference as well.|s
fe016|yeah if you can get it to|aa
fe008|and and|fh
fe008|but i mean this if this is a better interface for making these kinds of uh you know local changes then that'd be fine too.|fg
fe008|i don't i have no idea.|no
fe008|i think this is something that would need to be checked.|s
fe008|yeah.|bk
me013|okay.|bk
me013|the other thing i had actually was|s
me013|i i didn't realize this till today.|df
me013|but uh this is uh jose's last day.|rt
mn005|is my last my last day.|na
me011|yeah.|aa
fe016|oh!|fe
mn017|oh!|fe
fe008|oh!|fe
mn005|my my last meeting about meetings.|s
me011|you're not going to be here tomorrow?|bu
me011|oh that's right.|bk
mn005|yeah.|bk
me011|tomorrow|%--
mn005|because uh i leave uh the next sunday.|df
mn014|the last meeting meeting?|bu
me011|it's off.|s
mn005|i will come back to home to spain.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|oh.|bk
me013|yeah.|aa
me013|i so i i|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and i i would like to to to say thank you very much uh to all people in the group and at icsi.|ft
fe016|oh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|yeah.|b
me011|it was good having you.|ba
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|yeah.|aa
mn005|because i i enjoyed very much.|df
mn017|huh.|b
mn005|uh|fh
mn005|and i'm sorry by the result of overlapping.|fa
mn005|because uh i haven't good results uh yet.|df
mn005|but uh i i pretend to to continuing out to spain uh during the the following months.|s
mn005|uh because i have uh another ideas.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|but uh i haven't enough time to to with six months it's not enough to to to research.|s
me011|yep.|aa
me013|yeah.|aa
mn005|and i mean if uh the topic is uh so difficult.|s
mn005|uh in my opinion there isn't|s
me013|yeah maybe somebody else will come along and will be uh interested in working on it.|fg
me013|and could start off from where you are also you know.|s
me013|they'd make use of of what you've done.|rt
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|bk
mn005|but uh i i will try to recommend uh at uh the spanish government.|s
mn005|but uh the following scholarship uh uh uh will be here more time.|s
mn005|because uh in my opinion is is better uh for us to to spend more time here.|df
mn005|and to work more time in a topic.|df
mn005|no?|d
me013|yeah it's a very short time.|aa
mn005|but uh|fh
me013|yeah.|bk
me011|yeah six months is hard.|aa
me013|yeah.|bk
mn005|yeah it is.|aa
me011|i think a year is a lot better.|cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|aa
mn005|it's difficult.|s
mn005|you you have uh you are lucky.|s
mn005|and you you find a solution in in in some few uh months uh?|s
mn005|okay.|bk
mn005|but uh i think it's not uh common.|s
mn005|but uh anyway thank you.|ft
mn005|thank you very much.|e

me011|great.|ba
me013|well|%--
fe008|great.|ba
me013|thank you jose.|ft

fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|keep in touch.|co
me013|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me013|i guess uh unless somebody has something else we'll read read our digits.|ft
me011|digits?|cs
me013|and we'll get our|s
mn014|uh|%--
me011|are we going to do them simultaneously?|rt
mn014|oops.|fa
me013|get our last bit of uh jose's jose jose's digit.|s
me011|or|qrr
mn005|you uh|%--
me013|uh i'm sorry?|br
mn005|you prefer uh to eat uh chocolate uh at the coffee break uh at the or you prefer now before after|qrr
fe008|well we have a time|s
mn017|no we prefer to keep it for ourselves.|ar
mn014|during|s
mn017|yeah yeah.|aa
fe008|well we have a a time time constraint.|s
mn014|during digits.|e
me013|so keep it away from that end of the table.|co
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|bk
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|why is it that i can read your mind?|qh
me011|well we've got to wait until after after we take the mikes off.|s
mn014|no no.|ar
me011|so are we going to do digits simultaneously?|rt
me013|well|%--
fe016|you this is our reward if we do our|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|or what?|qrr
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|okay.|bk
mn014|simultaneous digit chocolate task.|s
mn005|i i think uh it's enough uh for more for more people after.|s
me013|we're going to we're going to do digits at the same|s
fe016|oh!|ba
mn017|huh.|ba
mn005|but uh|%--
fe008|that's nice.|ba
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fg
fe016|oh thanks jose.|ft

mn017|oh yeah.|bk
mn017|it doesn't it won't leave this room.|j
me013|all right so in the interest of getting to the|fg
fe016|we could do digits while other people eat.|cs
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|aa
fe016|so it's background crunching.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn017|huh.|ba
mn005|is uh a another acoustic event.|ba
fe008|nice.|ba
fe016|we don't have background chewing.|s
mn014|background crunch yeah.|2
fe016|no we don't have any data with background eating.|e
mn017|huh.|b
mn014|yeah.|aa
fe016|i'm serious.|df
me013|she's she's serious.|s
me011|it's just the rest of the digits the rest of the digits are very clean.|df
fe016|i am serious.|na
me013|she is serious.|r
mn017|huh.|b
mn005|are you|qy
mn005|oh they're clean.|bk
fe016|well|%--
me011|um without a lot of background noise.|df
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|and it|s
me011|so i'm just not sure.|s
fe016|you have to write down like while what you're what chocolate you're eating.|cs
fe016|because they might make different sounds.|df
fe016|like nuts chocolate with nuts chocolate without nuts.|e
fe008|oh.|b
mn014|crunchy frogs.|j
me013|um|fh
mn017|chocolate adaptation.|s
me013|actually actually kind of careful.|s
me013|because i have a strong allergy to nuts.|df
me013|so i have to sort of figure out one without|s
fe016|that oh yeah they they might.|na
me013|it's hard to hard to say.|s
fe016|maybe those?|cs
fe016|they're so|s
me013|i don't know.|no
fe016|i don't know.|no
me013|um|fh
fe016|this is you know this is a different kind of speech.|s
me013|well|%--
mn005|take take several.|cs
fe016|looking at chocolates deciding|s
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|you know it's another style.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|yeah i may i may hold off.|bk
me013|but if i was uh but maybe i'll get some later.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|thanks.|ft
me013|well well why don't we|cs
me013|he he's worried about a ticket.|df
me013|why don't we do a simultaneous one?|cs
fe016|okay.|bk
me011|okay.|bk
fe008|okay.|bk
mn017|huh.|b
me013|simultaneous one?|bu
me013|okay.|bk
me011|remember to read the transcript number please.|co
fe016|and you laughed at me too the first time i said that.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn005|okay.|bk
mn014|oops.|fa
me013|i have to what?|br

me013|wait wait a minute wait a minute.|co
me013|we want we want|s

me013|we want it synchronized.|s
mn005|yeah.|bk

fe016|yeah.|aa
fe016|oh you've done this one before?|rt
mn014|that's|%--
fe008|you've read digits together with us haven't you?|bu
fe016|together.|e
fe008|i mean at the same time.|e
mn005|no.|ar
fe008|oh you haven't.|bk
fe016|i'm not we we oh and you haven't done this either.|s
me013|okay.|bk
fe008|oh okay.|bk
mn014|oh yeah.|bk
fe016|the first time is traumatic.|s
me013|yeah.|aa
fe016|but|%--
fe008|oh and the groupings are important.|fg
mn005|huh.|b
fe008|so you're supposed to pause between the groupings.|s
mn005|the grouping.|s
me013|yeah.|aa
mn005|yeah.|bk
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so uh|fh
mn017|you mean that the the grouping is supposed to be synchronized?|bu
me011|yeah sure.|aa
fe008|no.|ar
me013|no no.|ar
mn017|no?|br
mn017|no?|br
me013|synchronized digits.|s
fe008|no.|ar
fe016|that'd be good.|s
fe016|we'll give everybody the same sheet.|cs
mn017|it's like a like a greek like a greek choir?|bu
fe016|but they say different|cs
mn017|you know?|d
mn017|like|%--
me013|yes.|aa
me011|hey what a good idea.|ba
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|we could do the same sheet for everyone.|cs
me011|have them all read them at once.|cs
fe016|well different digits.|df
mn014|uh|%--
fe016|but same groupings.|df
me011|or or just same digits.|arp
fe016|so they would all be|df
me011|see if anyone notices.|rt
fe016|yeah.|aa
fe008|yeah that'd be good.|ba
me013|there's so many possibilities.|j
fe008|and then then we can sing them next time.|cs
me013|uh okay why don't we go?|fg
me013|uh one two three go.|co
fe008|okay.|bk
fe008|huh!|z
me013|and andreas has the last word.|s
me011|did you read it twice or what?|qrr
fe016|he's no he's trying to get good recognition performance.|df
fe008|he had the|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|he had the the long form.|df
mn017|no.|ar
