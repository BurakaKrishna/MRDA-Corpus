me011|yeah we had a long discussion about how much how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out.|z
me011|so|z
me011|morgan wants to make it hard.|z
me018|it it doesn't|z
me011|did did did it|z
me011|i didn't even check yesterday whether it was moving.|z
me018|it didn't move yesterday either when i started it.|z
me011|so|z
me018|so i don't know if it doesn't like both of us.|z
me011|channel three?|z
me011|channel three?|z
me018|you know i discovered something yesterday on these um wireless ones.|z
me001|channel two.|z
me011|uhhuh?|z
me018|you can tell if it's picking up breath noise and stuff.|z
me011|yeah.|z
me011|it has a little indicator on it on the a. f.|z
me018|uhhuh.|z
me018|so if you|z
me018|yeah if you breathe under breathe and then you see a. f go off then you know it's picking up your mouth noise.|z
fe016|oh that's good.|z
fe016|because we have a lot of breath noises.|z
me011|yep.|z
me011|test.|z
fe016|in fact if you listen to just the channels of people not talking it's like.|z
fe016|it's very|z
me011|what?|z
me011|did you see hannibal recently or something?|z
fe016|sorry.|z
fe016|exactly.|z
fe016|it's very disconcerting.|z
fe016|okay.|fg
fe016|so um|fh
fe016|i was going to try to get out of here like in half an hour.|s^rt
fe016|um|fh
fe016|because i really appreciate people coming.|s
fe016|and the main thing that i was going to ask people to help with today is to give input on what kinds of database format we should use in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts.|s
fe016|so anything that transcribers or discourse coders or whatever put in the signal with time marks for like words and phone boundaries and all the stuff we get out of the forced alignments and the recognizer.|s^e
fe016|so we have this um|fh|s.%--
fe016|i think a starting point is clearly the the channelized output of dave gelbart's program.|s
fe016|which don brought a copy of.|s^e^rt
me011|yeah.|b
me011|yeah i'm i'm familiar with that.|s^bk|s
me011|i mean we i sort of already have developed an x. m. l format for this sort of stuff.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|which|%-
me018|can i see it?|qy^rt^t3
me011|and so the only question is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not.|s
me011|have you looked at that?|qy^rt
me011|i mean i had a web page up.|s^df
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|so|fh
fe016|i actually mostly need to be able to link up or|s.%--
me011|so|fg
fe016|it's it's a question both of what the representation is and|s.%-
me011|you mean this?|qy^d^rt^t3
me011|i guess i am going to be standing up and drawing on the board.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|so you should definitely.|s^na
me011|um so so it definitely had that as a concept.|s
me011|so it has a single timeline.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|s^bk
me011|and then you can have lots of different sections.|s
me011|each of which have i. d.'s attached to it.|s
me011|and then you can refer from other sections to those i. d.'s.|s
me011|if you want to.|s^e
me011|so that|s.%--
me011|um|fh
me011|so that you start with with a timeline tag.|s^df
me011|timeline.|s^t1
me011|and then you have a bunch of times.|s
me011|i don't i don't remember exactly what my notation was.|s^no
mn017|oh i remember seeing an example of this.|s^bk|s
me011|but it|%-
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|right.|s^bk^r
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
me011|yeah.|s^bk
me011|t.   equals one point three two.|s^t1
me011|uh|fh
me011|and then i i also had optional things like accuracy.|s
me011|and then i. d equals t.   one uh one seven.|s^t1
me011|and then i also wanted to to be to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp.|s
fe016|right.|s^bk
me011|yeah so these are arbitrary assigned by a program.|s
me011|not not by a user.|s^e
me011|so you have a whole bunch of those.|s
me011|and then somewhere further down you might have something like an utterance tag.|s
me011|which has start equals t. seventeen.|s^e
me011|end equals t. eighteen.|s^e
me011|so what that's saying is we know it starts at this particular time.|s:s
me011|we don't know when it ends.|s:s^no
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|but it ends at this t. eighteen.|s
me011|which may be somewhere else.|s^e
me011|we say there's another utterance.|s
me011|we don't know what the time actually is.|s
me011|but we know that it's the same time as this end time.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me011|you know thirty eight.|s^e
me011|whatever you want.|s
mn017|so you're essentially defining a lattice.|s^bu
me011|okay.|b
me011|yes.|s^aa
me011|exactly.|s^aa
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|and then uh and then these also have i. d.'s.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|so you could you could have some sort of other other tag later in the file that would be something like um oh i don't know uh noise type equals door slam.|s^cs
me011|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me011|and then uh you could either say time equals a particular time mark or you could do other sorts of references.|s^cs
me011|so or or you might have a prosody.|s
me011|prosody.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|d.  ?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|t.  ?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|it's an o.   instead of an i.  .|s^df^nd
fe016|but the d.   is good.|s^aap
me011|you like the d.  ?|qy^d^j^rt
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|that's a good d.  .|s^ba
me011|um|fg
me011|you know so you could have some sort of type here.|s
me011|and then you could have|s.%--
me011|um|fh
me011|the utterance that it's referring to could be u. seventeen or something like that.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|so|fh
fe016|i mean that seems that seems great for all of the encoding of things with time.|s^ba
fe016|and|fh
me011|oh well.|s^bk
fe016|um|fh
fe016|i i guess my question is more uh what what do you do with say a forced alignment?|qw
fe016|i mean you've got all these phone labels.|s^df
fe016|and what do you do if you just conceptually if you get um transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing because you've got a new recognition output?|qw
fe016|or sort of what's the um sequence of going from the waveforms that stay the same the transcripts that may or may not change and then the utterance which where the time boundaries that may or may not change?|qw
mn017|oh that's|s^bk.%-
mn017|that's actually very nicely handled here.|s
fe016|um|fh
mn017|because you could you could all you'd have to change is the um time stamps in the timeline without without uh changing the i. d.'s.|s^df
fe016|and you'd be able to propagate all of the the information?|qy^bu^d
me011|right.|s^bk
me011|that's the that's why you do that extra level of indirection.|s
me011|so that you can just change the timeline.|s^df
mn017|except the timeline is going to be huge.|s
mn017|if you say|s.%--
me011|yes.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|yeah especially at the phone level.|s^na
mn017|suppose you have a phone level alignment.|s^e
fe016|the we we have phone level backtraces.|s
mn017|you'd have you'd have|%-
me011|yeah this|fg|%-
me011|i don't think i would do this for phone level.|s^ng
fe016|um|fh
me011|i think for phone level you want to use some sort of binary representation.|s
me011|because it'll be too dense otherwise.|s^df
fe016|okay.|fg
fe016|so if you were doing that and you had this sort of companion uh thing that gets called up for phone level uh what would that look like?|fh|qw
fe016|how would you|qw.%-
me011|i would use just an existing an existing way of doing it.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|but but why not use it for phone level?|qw
mn017|it's just a matter of it's just a matter of it being bigger.|s^df
mn017|but if you have|s.%--
mn017|you know barring memory limitations uh i mean this is still the|s.%-
me011|it's parsing limitations.|s^nd
me011|i don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for.|s
mn017|oh no.|s^ar
mn017|you would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone level information i'd imagine.|s^nd
fe016|so you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your in your x. m. l or something.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
me011|i mean you'd|%--
fe016|um|fh
fe016|because it does get very with|s^df.%-
me011|i i am imagining you'd have multiple versions of this depending on the information that you want.|s
mn017|you|%-
fe016|right.|s^aa
me011|um|fh
me011|i'm just|s.%--
me011|what i'm wondering is whether|s.%--
me011|i think for word level this would be okay.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^aa^r
me011|for word level it's all right.|s
fe016|definitely.|s^na
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|for lower than word level you're talking about so much data that i just i don't know.|s^no
me011|i don't know if that|s.%--
fe016|i mean we actually have|s.%--
fe016|so one thing that don is doing is we're we're running for every frame you get a pitch value.|s
me018|lattices are big too.|s
fe016|and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values.|s^e
fe016|depending on|s^e.%-
me011|yeah i mean for something like that i would use p. file.|fg|s
me011|or or any frame level stuff i would use p. file.|s
fe016|meaning?|qw^d^rt
me011|uh that's a well or something like it.|s
me011|it's uh icsi has a format for frame level representation of features.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|um|fh
fe016|that you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an i. d.|s^bu
me011|right.|s^aa
me011|right.|s^aa^r
me011|or or there's a there's a particular way in x. m. l to refer to external resources.|s
fe016|and|fh
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|so you would say refer to this external file.|s:s^co
me011|um|fh
me011|so that external file wouldn't be in|s.%--
fe016|so that might that might work.|s^na
me018|but what what's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format?|qw^rt
me011|more compact.|s
me011|which i think is is better.|s^ba
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|i mean if you did it at this|s.%-
fe016|i mean these are long meetings.|s
fe016|and with for every frame|s.%--
me011|you don't want to do it with that|s.%--
fe016|um|fh
me011|anything at frame level you had better encode binary.|s
me011|or it's going to be really painful.|s^df
mn017|or you just|s^cs.%--
mn017|i mean i like text formats.|s^cs
mn017|um|fh
mn017|you can always uh g. zip them.|s^cs^df
mn017|and um you know decompress them on the fly if if space is really a concern.|fh|s^cs^df
me018|yeah i was|fg|s.%--
me018|i was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people.|s
me011|well but if you're talking about one per frame you're talking about gigabyte-size files.|s^nd
me011|you're going to actually run out of space in your filesystem for one file.|s^df
fe016|these are big files.|s^na
fe016|these are really|s.%--
fe016|i mean|fh
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|because you have a two-gigabyte limit on most o. s.'s.|s^df
mn017|right.|s^bk
mn017|okay.|s^bk
mn017|i would say|s.%--
mn017|okay so frame level is probably not a good idea.|s^bk|s^na
fe016|and it's|%-
mn017|but for phone level stuff it's perfectly|s.%--
mn017|like phones or syllables or anything like that.|s
fe016|phones are every five frames though.|s^ng
fe016|so|fh
fe016|or something like that.|s^e
mn017|but but but most of the frames are actually not speech.|s^df
mn017|so|fh
mn017|you know people don't|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|look at it words times the average the average number of phones in an english word is i don't know five maybe?|qy^bu^d^df^rt
fe016|but we actually|s^ng.%--
mn017|so look at it number of words times five.|s^df
fe016|oh so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the|s^bu.%--
mn017|that's not that not|%-
fe016|long pause phones.|s^bsc
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn017|exactly.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|okay.|s^bk
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|that's true.|s^aa
fe016|but you do have to keep them in there.|s
fe016|yeah.|fh
me011|so i think it it's debatable whether you want to do phone level in the same thing.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|but i think anything at frame level even p. file is too verbose.|s^ba
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|so|fg
me011|i would use something tighter than p. files.|s^cs
fe016|do you are you familiar with it?|qy^rt
me011|so|fh
fe016|i haven't seen this particular format.|s^df
mn017|i mean i've i've used them.|s^na
fe016|but|fh
mn017|i don't know what their structure is.|s^no
fe016|okay.|s^bk
mn017|i've forgot what the|s^no.%-
me018|but wait a minute.|s^co
me018|p. file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or p. l. p values.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me011|it's whatever you want actually.|s^ng
me018|right.|s^bk
me011|so that what's nice about the p. file it|s.%--
me011|built into it is the concept of frames utterances sentences that sort of thing that structure.|s
me011|and then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values.|s
fe016|oh.|s^bk
me011|and it can take different types.|s
me011|so it they don't all have to be floats.|s
me011|you know you can have integers and you can have doubles and all that sort of stuff.|s^e
fe016|so that that sounds that sounds about what i|s.%-
me011|um|fh
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me011|and it has a header it has a header format that describes it to some extent.|s
me011|so|fh
me011|the only problem with it is it's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file.|s
me011|even though they're always sequential.|s^e
me011|and so it does waste a lot of space.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me011|but it's still a lot tighter than than ascii.|s
me011|and we have a lot of tools already to deal with it.|s
fe016|you do?|qy^d
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|is there some documentation on this somewhere?|qy^rt
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|there's a ton of it.|s^na
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|great.|s^ba
me011|man pages and uh source code and me.|s^df
fe016|so|fh
fe016|i mean that sounds good.|s^ba
fe016|i i was just looking for something|s.%--
fe016|i'm not a database person.|s^df
fe016|but something sort of standard enough that you know if we start using this we can give it out.|s
fe016|other people can work on it.|s
me011|yeah it's not standard.|s^bk|s^nd
fe016|or is it|qy.%-
me011|i mean it's something that we developed at icsi.|s^df^nd
me011|but uh|fh
fe016|but it's been used here.|s
me011|but it's been used here.|s^m^na
fe016|and people've|s.%-
me011|and and you know we have a well configured system that you can distribute for free.|s
me011|and|%-
me018|i mean it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store your computed features in right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|okay.|b
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|we have|s.%--
mn017|actually we we use a generalization of the the sphere format.|s^rt
me018|huh.|s^bk
mn017|um|fh
mn017|but|fh
mn017|yeah so there is something like that.|s^na
mn017|but it's um probably not as|s.%-
me018|and i think there's|s.%-
me011|well what does h. t. k do for features?|qw
me011|or does it even have a concept of features?|qy
mn017|they it has its own|s.%--
mn017|i mean entropic has their own feature format that's called like s.   s. d or some s. f or something like that.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me011|i'm just wondering would it be worth while to use that instead?|qy^cs^df^rt
mn017|huh?|%
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|this is exactly the kind of decision it's just whatever|s.%-
me018|but i mean people don't typically share this kind of stuff right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|right.|b
me018|i mean|fh
me011|they generate their own.|s^na
fe016|actually i i just you know we we've done this stuff on prosodics.|fg|s
me018|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files.|s
fe016|and we just have an ascii uh output of frame by frame.|s
me011|uh right.|s^bk
fe016|which is fine.|s^df
fe016|but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
fe016|i mean we could do it.|s
fe016|i was just thinking if there's something that where all the frame values are|s.%--
me011|and and again if you have a|s.%-
fe016|huh?|qw^rt
me011|if you have a two hour long meeting that's going to|s.%-
fe016|they're they're they're quite large.|s
fe016|and these are for ten minute switchboard conversations.|s
me011|yeah i mean they'd be enormous.|s^na
me011|right.|s^aa
fe016|and|fh
fe016|so it's doable.|s
fe016|it's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame by frame.|s^df
fe016|and it doesn't have any kind of|s.%--
fe016|um|fh
me018|is is the sharing part of this a pretty important consideration?|qy^rt
me018|or does that just sort of uh a nice thing to have?|qrr
fe016|i i don't know enough about what we're going to do with the data.|s^no^rt
fe016|but i thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding.|s
fe016|and just i mean we have to use we have to make some decision about what to do.|s^df
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|and especially for the prosody work what what it ends up being is you get features from the signal.|s
fe016|and of course those change every time your alignments change.|s
fe016|so you rerun a recognizer.|s
fe016|you want to recompute your features um and then keep the database up to date.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|or you change a word or you change a utterance boundary segment which is going to happen a lot.|s
fe016|and so i wanted something where all of this can be done in a elegant way.|s
fe016|and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else that it can be done flexibly.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|it doesn't have to be pretty.|s
fe016|it just has to be you know easy to use and|s.%--
me011|yeah the other thing|s.%--
me011|we should look at atlas.|s^cs
me011|the nist thing.|s^e
fe016|oh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me011|and see if they have anything at that level.|s^cs
fe016|uh|fh
me011|i mean i'm not sure what to do about this with atlas.|s^no
me011|because they chose a different route.|s^df
me011|i chose something that|s.%--
me011|there are sort of two choices.|s
me011|your your file format can know about know that you're talking about language and speech which is what i chose and time.|s^e
me011|or your file format can just be a graph representation.|s^e
me011|and then the application has to impose the structure on top.|s
me011|so what it looked like atlas chose is they chose the other way.|s
me011|which was their file format is just nodes and links.|s^e
me011|and you have to interpret what they mean yourself.|s^e
fe016|and why did you not choose that type of approach?|qw^rt
me011|uh because i knew that we were doing speech.|s
me011|and i thought it was better if you're looking at a raw file to be for the tags to say it's an utterance as opposed to the tag to say it's a link.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|but other than that are they compatible?|qy^rt
me011|so but|fh
fe016|i mean you could sort of|s.%--
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|they're reasonably compatible.|s^na
fe016|i mean you you could|s.%-
me018|you could probably translate between them.|s
fe016|yeah that's|s^bk|s.%--
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe016|so|fh
me011|so|fg
me011|well the other thing is if we choose to use atlas which maybe we should just do we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it.|s
fe016|okay.|b
fe016|i don't|%-
fe016|so this is what the meeting's about.|s
fe016|just sort of how to|s^df.%--
me011|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|um because we need to come up with a database like this just to do our work.|s^df
fe016|and i actually don't care as long as it's something useful to other people what we choose.|s
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|so maybe it's maybe you know|s.%--
fe016|if if you have any idea of how to choose because i don't.|s^no
me011|the only thing|s.%-
me011|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|do they already have tools?|qy^rt
me011|i mean i i chose this for a couple reasons.|s
me011|one of them is that it's easy to parse.|s^df
me011|you don't need a full x. m. l parser.|s^df
me011|it's very easy to just write a perl script to parse it.|s^df
mn017|as long as uh each tag is on one line.|s
me011|exactly.|s^aa
me011|exactly.|s^aa^r
me011|which i always do.|s
fe016|and you can have as much information in the tag as you want.|s
fe016|right?|qy^d^g
me011|well i have it structured.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|so each type tag has only particular items that it can take.|s
fe016|can you but you can add to those structures if you|s^bu.%--
me011|sure.|s^aa
me011|if you have more information.|s^2
me011|so what what nist would say is that instead of doing this you would say something like link start equals um you know some node i. d.|s:s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|so|fh
me011|end equals some other node i. d.|s:s
me011|and then type would be utterance.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me011|you know so it's very similar.|s
fe016|so why would it be a a waste to do it this way if it's similar enough that we can always translate it?|qw
me018|it probably wouldn't be a waste.|s^ng
me018|it would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch we'd just have to translate everything.|s^df
me011|write a translator.|s^2
me011|but it|fg
fe016|but it but that sounds|s.%-
me011|since they are developing a big|s.%-
me018|but that's|s.%--
me018|i don't think that's a big deal.|s^ba
fe016|as long as it is|s.%-
me011|they're developing a big infrastructure.|s
me011|and so it seems to me that if if we want to use that we might as well go directly to what they're doing rather than|s^cs.%-
mn017|if we want to|s.%-
mn017|do they already have something that's that would be useful for us in place?|qy^rt
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|see that's the question.|s
me018|i mean how stable is their|qw.%--
me018|are they ready to go?|qy^rt
me011|the i looked at it|s.%--
me018|or|qrr.%--
me011|the last time i looked at it was a while ago.|s^no
me011|probably a year ago.|s^e
me018|huh.|s^bk
me011|uh when we first started talking about this.|s^e
me011|and at that time at least it was still not very complete.|s^nd
me011|and so specifically they didn't have any external format representation at that time.|s^e^nd
me011|they just had the sort of conceptual node uh annotated transcription graph.|s^e
me011|which i really liked.|s^e
me011|and that's exactly what this stuff is based on.|s
me011|since then they've developed their own external file format.|s
me011|which is uh you know this sort of this sort of thing.|s^e
me011|um and apparently they've also developed a lot of tools.|fh|s
me011|but i haven't looked at them.|s
me011|maybe i should.|s^cs
mn017|we should we should find out.|s^cs^na
fe016|i mean would the tools would the tools run on something like this if you can translate them anyway?|qy
me011|um what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail.|h|s
fe016|i mean that i guess it's a question that|s.%--
mn017|it's a hassle.|s^ng
fe016|uh yeah.|fh
mn017|if|%
me011|that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other.|s^df
fe016|okay.|s^bk
mn017|i i think if it's conceptually close and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using i mean it would be crazy to do something you know separate that|s.%--
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|yeah we might as well.|s^aa|s^na
me011|yep.|s^bk
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|so i'll i'll take a closer look at it.|s^cc
fe016|actually|fg
fe016|so it's|fg
fe016|that that would really be the question is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing.|s
me011|and|fh
me011|right.|s^bk
fe016|because once we start sort of doing this i don't we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash it out again.|s^df
me011|the|%-
me011|yep.|b
fe016|and|fh
me011|the other thing the other way that i sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the transcriber format.|s
fe016|right.|s^bk
me011|um|fh
fe016|right.|s^bk^r
me011|but|fh
fe016|i mean i like this.|s
fe016|this is sort of intuitively easy to actually read.|s
me011|yep.|s^bk
fe016|as easy it could as it could be.|s^e
fe016|but|fh
fe016|i suppose that as long as they have a type here that specifies utt|s.%--
fe016|um|fh
me011|it's almost the same.|s
fe016|it's yeah close enough that|s.%--
me011|the the the the point is with this though is that you can't really add any supplementary information.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|so if you suddenly decide that you want|s.%-
fe016|you have to make a different type.|s^cs
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|you'd have to make a different type.|s^m^na
fe016|so|fg
fe016|well if you look at it|s.%--
fe016|and um|fh
fe016|i guess in my mind i don't know enough jane would know better about the types of annotations.|s
fe016|and and but i imagine that those are things that would well you guys mentioned this that could span any|s.%--
fe016|it could be in its own channel.|s
fe016|it could span time boundaries of any type.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|it could be instantaneous.|s
fe016|things like that.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|and then from the recognition side we have backtraces at the phone level.|s
fe016|if if it can handle that it could handle states or whatever.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|and then at the prosody-level we have frame sort of like cepstral feature files.|s
me011|yep.|b
fe016|uh like these p. files or anything like that.|s^e
fe016|and that's sort of the world of things that i|s.%--
fe016|and then we have the aligned channels of course.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|and|fh
mn017|it seems to me you want to keep the frame level stuff separate.|s^bs
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|i i definitely agree.|s^na
mn017|and then|%-
fe016|and i wanted to find actually a a nicer format or a maybe a more compact format than what we used before.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|just because you've got ten channels or whatever and two hours of a meeting.|s^df
fe016|it's it's a lot of|s.%-
mn017|now now how would you how would you represent um multiple speakers in this framework?|qw
me011|huge.|s^na
mn017|were you would just represent them as|s.%--
me011|um|h
mn017|you would have like a speaker tag or something?|qy^d^rt
me011|there's a speaker tag up at the top which identifies them.|s
me011|and then each|s.%--
me011|the way i had it is each turn or each utterance i don't even remember now had a speaker i. d tag attached to it.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me011|and in this format you would have a different tag.|s
me011|which which would uh be linked to the link.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me011|so so somewhere else you would have another thing that would be|s.%--
me011|um|fh
me011|let's see would it be a node or a link?|qr^t1
me011|um|fh
me011|and so so this one would have um an i. d is link link seventy four or something like that.|s
me011|and then somewhere up here you would have a link that that uh you know was referencing l. seventy four and had speaker adam.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|actually it's the channel i think that|s^ng.%--
mn017|is?|%
me011|you know.|fh
me011|or something like that.|s
fe016|i mean|%--
mn017|well channel or speaker or whatever.|s
fe016|yeah channel is what the channelized output|s.%-
mn017|it doesn't|s.%-
me011|this isn't quite right.|s
me011|i have to look at it again.|s
mn017|right.|b
fe016|yeah but|s^bk|%-
mn017|but but so how in the nist format do we express a hierarchical relationship between um say an utterance and the words within it?|fg|qw
mn017|so how do you tell that these are the words that belong to that utterance?|qw
me011|um you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they're all belonging to this i. d.|h|s
mn017|uhhuh.|s^bk
me018|so each thing refers to the utterance that it belongs to.|s^bu
me011|right.|s^aa
me018|so it's it's not it's sort of bottom up.|s^bu
me011|and then each utterance could refer to a turn.|s
me011|and each turn could refer to something higher up.|s
fe016|and what if you actually have|qw.%--
fe016|so right now what you have as utterance um the closest thing that comes out of the channelized is the stuff between the segment boundaries that the transcribers put in or that thilo put in.|s
fe016|which may or may not actually be like a it's usually not um the beginning and end of a sentence say.|s^e
me011|well that's why i didn't call it sentence.|s^df
fe016|so|fh
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|um so it's like a segment or something.|s
me011|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|so|fh
fe016|i mean i assume this is possible that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe you can say you know from for from the beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence from the annotations this is a unit.|s
fe016|even though it never actually|s^e.%--
fe016|it's only a unit by virtue of the annotations at the word level.|s^e
me011|sure.|s^aa
me011|i mean so you would you would have yet another tag.|s
fe016|and then that would get a tag somehow.|s
me011|you'd have another tag which says this is of type sentence.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|and|fh
fe016|but it's just not overtly in the|s.%--
me011|what|%-
mn017|okay.|b
fe016|um because this is exactly the kind of|fh|s.%--
mn017|so|fg
fe016|i think that should be possible as long as the|s.%--
fe016|but uh what i don't understand is where the where in this type of file that would be expressed.|s^no
me011|right.|s^bk
me011|you would have another tag somewhere.|s
me011|it's well there're two ways of doing it.|s
fe016|so it would just be floating before the sentence or floating after the sentence without a time mark.|s
me011|you could have some sort of link type.|s^df
me011|type equals sentence.|s^df
me011|and i. d is s. whatever.|s^df
me011|and then lower down you could have an utterance.|s^df
me011|so the type is utterance equals utt.|s^df
me011|and you could either say that|s.%--
me011|no.|s^ar
me011|i don't know.|s^no
me011|i take that back.|s
mn017|so here's the thing.|s
mn017|um|fh
fe016|see because it's|s.%-
me011|can you can you say that this is part of this?|qy^rt
mn017|hhh.|%
fe016|it's|%
me018|you would just have a|s.%-
me011|or do you say this is part of this?|qrr
me011|i think|s.%--
fe016|but they're|s.%-
me018|you would refer up to the sentence.|s
mn017|well the thing|s.%-
fe016|they're actually overlapping each other sort of.|s^nd
me011|so|fg
mn017|the thing is that something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose.|s^ng
me011|right.|b
fe016|you have to have another type then i guess.|s
mn017|so|%-
mn017|um|fg
mn017|well.|fg
me011|well i think i'm i think i had better look at it again.|s^cs
mn017|let's let's so let's|s.%-
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|okay.|s^bk
mn017|so|fg
me011|because i i'm|s^df.%--
fe016|okay.|b
mn017|so for instance|s.%-
me011|there's one level there's one more level of indirection that i'm forgetting.|s
mn017|suppose you have a word sequence.|s
mn017|and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence.|s
mn017|say one segmentation is in terms of um you know uh sentences.|s
mn017|and another segmentation is in terms of um i don't know prosodic phrases.|s
mn017|and let's say that they don't nest.|s
mn017|so you know a prosodic phrase may cross two sentences or something.|fh|s
me011|right.|b
mn017|i don't know if that's true or not.|s^no
mn017|but let's|fh|s.%-
fe016|well it's definitely true with the segment.|s
mn017|right.|s^bk
fe016|that's what i exactly what i meant by the utterances versus the sentence could be sort of|s^df.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|so you want to be you want to say this this word is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase.|s
fe016|yeah.|fh
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|but the phrase is not part of the sentence.|s
mn017|and neither is the sentence part of the phrase.|s
fe016|right.|s^aa
me011|i'm pretty sure that you can do that.|s^na
me011|but i'm forgetting the exact level of nesting.|s^no
mn017|so you would have to have two different pointers from the word up one level up.|fg|s
mn017|one to the|s.%-
me011|so so what you would end up having is a tag saying here's a word.|s:s
me011|and it starts here and it ends here.|s:s
mn017|right.|s^bk
me011|and then lower down you would say here's a prosodic boundary.|s:s
me011|and it has these words in it.|s:s
me011|and lower down you'd have here's a sentence.|s:s
fe016|right.|b
mn017|right.|b
me011|and it has these words in it.|s:s
fe016|so you would be able to go in and say you know give me all the words in the in the prosodic phrase.|s:s^co
fe016|and give me all the words in the|s.%-:s^co.%-
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me011|so i think that's that would|s.%--
fe016|um okay.|s^bk
me011|let me look at it again.|s^co
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|okay.|s^bk
mn017|the the the other issue that you had was how do you actually efficiently extract um find and extract information in a structure of this type.|s^tc
me011|so|fh
fe016|that's good.|s^ba^t3
mn017|so you gave some examples like|fh|s.%--
fe016|well.|h
fe016|uh and i mean you guys might|s.%--
fe016|i don't know if this is premature.|s^no
fe016|because i suppose once you get the representation you can do this.|s^df
fe016|but the kinds of things i was worried about is|s.%--
mn017|no that's not clear.|s^ar|s^nd
fe016|uh|fh
mn017|i mean yeah you sure you can do it.|s^df
fe016|well okay.|s^bk
fe016|so if it|s.%-
mn017|but can you do it sort of you know it|s^df.%--
fe016|i mean i can't do it.|s^j^nd
fe016|but i can|s.%--
fe016|um|fh
mn017|you got to you got to do this you you're going to want to do this very quickly.|s
me011|well|fg
mn017|or else you'll spend all your time sort of searching through very complex data structures.|s
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|you'd need a sort of a paradigm for how to do it.|s
fe016|but an example would be find all the cases in which adam started to talk while andreas was talking and his pitch was rising.|s
fe016|andreas's pitch.|s^e
fe016|that kind of thing.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
me011|i mean that's going to be|s.%--
me011|is the rising pitch a feature?|qy^rt
me011|or is it going to be in the same file?|qrr
fe016|well the rising pitch will never be hand annotated.|h|s
fe016|so the all the prosodic features are going to be automatically|s^df.%--
me011|but the|fg
me011|i mean that's going to be hard regardless.|s
fe016|so they're going to be in those|s^df.%-
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me011|because you're going to have to write a program that goes through your feature file and looks for rising pitches.|s^df
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fg
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|so normally what we would do is we would say what do we want to assign rising pitch to.|s:qw^rt
fe016|are we going to assign it to words.|s:qy^rt
fe016|are we going to just assign it to sort of|s.%--:qy.%--
fe016|when it's rising we have a begin end rise representation.|s
fe016|but suppose we dump out this file.|s
fe016|and we say uh for every word we just classify it as you know rise or fall or neither.|s:s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|well in that case you would add that to this format.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|so we would basically be sort of um taking the format and enriching it with things that we want to query in relation to the words that are already in the file.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
fe016|and then querying it.|s
fe016|okay.|fh
mn017|you want sort of a grep that's that works at the structural on the structural representation.|s^cs
me011|you have that.|s^ng
me011|there's a standard again in x. m. l specifically for searching x. m. l documents structured x.   x. m. l documents where you can specify both the content and the structural position.|s
mn017|yeah but it's it's not clear that that's|s^bk|s^ng.%--
fe016|if|%-
mn017|that's relative to the structure of the x. m. l document.|s^df^nd
mn017|not to the structure of what you're representing in the document.|s^df^nd
me011|you use it as a tool.|s^df
me011|you use it as a tool.|s^df^r
me011|not an end user.|s^df
me011|it's not an end user thing.|s^df
mn017|right.|s^bk
me011|it's it's you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search.|s^df
mn017|right.|b
mn017|because here you're specifying a lattice.|s
fe016|uh|%
mn017|so the underlying that's the underlying data structure.|s
fe016|but as long as the|s.%-
mn017|and you want to be able to search in that lattice.|s
me011|it's a graph.|s^ng
me011|but|fh
mn017|that's different from searching through the text.|s
fe016|but it seems like as long as the features that|s.%-
me011|well.|fg
me011|no no no.|s^ar
me011|the whole point is that the text and the lattice are isomorphic.|s^df
me011|they represent each other completely.|s
mn017|um|fg
me011|so that|s.%--
me011|i mean|%-
fe016|that's true if the features from your acoustics or whatever that are not explicitly in this are at the level of these types.|s^aap
mn017|hhh.|%
fe016|that that if you can do that|s.%-
me011|yeah but that's going to be the trouble no matter what.|s^bk|s^df^ng
me011|right?|qy^d^g
me011|no matter what format you choose you're going to have the you're going to have the difficulty of relating the the frame level features.|s^df
fe016|that's right.|s^aa
fe016|that's true.|s^aa
fe016|that's why i was trying to figure out what's the best format for this representation.|s^df
me011|yep.|b
fe016|and it's still going to be|s.%--
fe016|it's still going to be uh not direct.|s
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|you know it|s.%--
me011|right.|s^bk
fe016|or another example was you know uh where in the language where in the word sequence are people interrupting.|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|i guess that one's actually easier.|s^ba
me018|what about|qw.%--
me018|what about um the idea of using a relational database to uh store the information from the x. m. l?|qo^r
me018|so you would have|s^df.%--
me018|x. m. l basically would|s^df.%--
me018|uh|fh
me018|you you could use the x. m. l to put the data in.|s^df
me018|and then when you get data out you put it back in x. m. l.|s^df
me018|so use x. m. l as sort of the the transfer format.|s^df
me011|transfer.|s^2
me018|uh but then you store the data in the database.|s^df
me018|which allows you to do all kinds of good search things in there.|s^e
me011|the uh|fg
me011|one of the things that atlas is doing is they're trying to define an a. p. i which is independent of the back store.|s
fe016|huh?|qy^bh
me011|so that uh you could define a single a. p. i and the the storage could be flat x. m. l files or a database.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|my opinion on that is for the sort of stuff that we're doing i suspect it's overkill to do a full relational database that um just a flat file and uh search tools i bet will be enough.|s^ba
mn017|but|%
me011|but that's the advantage of atlas is that if we actually take decide to go that route completely and we program to their a. p. i then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|it seems like the kind of thing you'd do if i don't know if people start adding all kinds of bells and whistles to the data.|s^ng
fe016|and so that might be|s.%--
fe016|i mean it'd be good for us to know to use a format where we know we can easily um input that to some database if other people are using it.|s^bd
me011|yep.|b
fe016|something like that.|s
me011|i guess i'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the the whole framework that that nist is talking about with atlas and a database and all that sort of stuff.|s^bd^na
fe016|so|fh
me011|because it's a big learning curve just to get going.|s^df
me018|huh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me011|whereas if we just do a flat file format sure it may not be as efficient.|s^cs^df
me011|but everyone can program in perl and and use it.|s^df
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|so as opposed to|s.%-
mn017|but this is|s.%--
mn017|i i'm still um not convinced that you can do much at all on the text on the flat file that that you know the text representation.|s^nd
mn017|because the text representation is going to be uh not reflecting the structure of of your words and annotations.|s^df
mn017|it's just it's|s^df.%--
me011|well if it's not representing it then how do you recover it?|qw^df^nd^rt
me011|of course it's representing it.|s^nd
mn017|no.|s^ar
mn017|you you have to|s.%--
me011|that's the whole point.|s^df
mn017|what you have to do is you have to basically|s.%--
mn017|yeah you can use perl to read it in and construct a internal representation that is essentially a lattice.|s^df
mn017|but the|s.%--
me018|yeah.|b
me011|okay.|s^bk
mn017|and then|s.%--
me011|well that was a different point.|s^ng
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me011|so what i was saying is that|s^df.%-
mn017|right.|b
mn017|but that's what you'll have to do.|s^ng
me011|for perl if you want to just do perl.|s^df^ng
me011|if you wanted to use the structured x. m. l query language that's a different thing.|s^nd
me011|and it's a set of tools that let you specify given the d.   d. d. t d. t. d of the document um what sorts of structural searches you want to do.|s^df
me011|so you want to say that you know you're looking for um a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it um and uh refers to a particular value.|s^e
me011|and so the point isn't that an end user who is looking for a query like you specified wouldn't program it in this language.|s^e
me011|what you would do is someone would build a tool that used that as a library.|s^e
me011|so that they so that you wouldn't have to construct the internal representations yourself.|s^df
fe016|is a|%-
fe016|see i think the kinds of questions at least in the next to the end of this year are there may be a lot of different ones.|s
fe016|but they'll all have a similar nature.|s
fe016|they'll be looking at either a word level prosodic uh an a value.|s
fe016|like a continuous value.|s^e
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|like the slope of something.|s^e
fe016|but|fh
fe016|you know we'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort uh either at the word level or at the segment level.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
fe016|or or something like that.|s^e
fe016|they're not going to be at the phone level and they're not going to be at the frame level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things.|s
fe016|and so the main thing is just being able|fh|s.%--
fe016|well i guess the two goals.|s
fe016|um one that chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions.|s^df
me011|right.|b
fe016|and being able to at least get enough uh information out on where we condition the location of features on information that's in the kind of file that you put up there.|s^df
fe016|and that would that would do it.|s
fe016|i mean for me.|s^df
me011|yeah.|s^bk
me011|i think that there are quick and dirty solutions.|s
me011|and then there are long-term big infrastructure solutions.|s
me011|and so we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both.|s^cs
fe016|in the between.|s^2
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|and especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away.|s^df^na
me011|um|fh
me011|right.|b
fe016|even if your tools change.|s^e
me011|and so it seems to me that|s.%--
me011|i mean i have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want.|s
me011|but if we use the atlas external file representation um it seems like it's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as i said in perl.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve we can use the whole atlas infrastructure.|s
fe016|i mean that sounds good to me.|s^na
me011|which has all that built in.|s^e
fe016|i i don't|%-
fe016|so|fg
fe016|if if you would look at that and let us know what you think|s^cs.%--
me011|sure.|s^aa
fe016|i mean i think we're sort of guinea pigs.|s^ba
fe016|because i i want to get the prosody work done.|s^df
fe016|but i don't want to waste time you know getting the|s^df.%--
mn017|oh maybe|%-
fe016|yeah?|qw^rt
mn017|um|h
me011|well i wouldn't wait for the formats because anything you pick we'll be able to translate to another form.|s^cs
mn017|well|fg
fe016|okay.|s^bk
mn017|well maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you'll you'll be dealing with.|s^cs
mn017|because um you know adam might have one opinion but you might have another.|s^df
me001|yeah.|b
mn017|so|fh
fe016|yeah definitely.|s^aa
mn017|i think the more eyes look at this the better.|s^cs^df
fe016|especially if there's um you know if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right|s^na.%--
fe016|oh hi.|s
me011|hi jane.|s
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|the right representation.|s^r
fe016|then you know i hope it won't|s.%--
fe016|we don't actually need the whole full-blown thing to be ready.|s
me011|can you|qy^t3.%--
me011|oh well.|s^ba^t3
fe016|so|fh
fe016|um|fh
fe016|so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what|s^co.%--
me011|sure.|s^aa
me001|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|um|fh
fe016|i think we're we're we're actually just|s^tc.%--
me011|we're about done.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|wrapping up.|s^na
me001|huh.|b
fe016|but|fh
fe016|um|fh
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|sorry it's a uh short meeting.|s^fa|s^df
fe016|but um|fh
fe016|well i don't know.|s^no
fe016|is there anything else?|qo^rt^tc
fe016|like|%--
fe016|i mean that helps me a lot.|s
me011|well i think the other thing we might want to look at is alternatives to p. file.|h|s^cs
fe016|but|fh
me011|i mean the reason i like p. file is i'm already familiar with it.|s^df
me011|we have expertise here.|s^df
me011|and so if we pick something else there's the learning curve problem.|s
me011|but i mean it is just something we developed at icsi.|s^df
me011|and so|fh
mn017|is there an is there an i. a. p. i?|qy^rt
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me011|there's an a. p. i for it.|s^na
me011|and uh|fh
mn017|there used to be a problem that they get too large.|s^rt
me011|a bunch of libraries p. file utilities.|s^na
mn017|and so basically the uh the filesystem wouldn't|s.%-
me011|well that's going to be a problem no matter what.|s^ng
me011|you have the two-gigabyte limit on the filesystem size.|s^df
me011|and we definitely hit that with broadcast news.|s^e
mn017|maybe you could extend the a. p. i to uh support uh like splitting up you know conceptually one file into smaller files on disk.|s^cs
mn017|so that you can essentially you know have arbitrarily long|s^df.%-
me011|yep.|s^bk
me011|most of the tools can handle that.|s^ng
me011|so that|s.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|we didn't do it at the a. p. i. level.|s
me011|we did it at the tool level.|s
me011|that that most many of them can you can specify several p. files.|s
me011|and they'll just be done sequentially.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me011|so|fh
fe016|so i guess|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|if if you and don can if you can show him the p. file stuff and see.|s^co
me011|sure.|s^aa
fe016|so this would be like for the f. zero.|s^df
me011|i mean if you do man p. file or apropos p. file you'll see a lot.|s
me001|true.|b
me001|i've used the p. file i think.|s^ng
me001|i've looked at it at least briefly i think when we were doing something.|s^bd
mn017|what does the p.   stand for anyway?|qw
me011|i have no idea.|s^no
me001|oh in there.|s^t1
me011|i didn't i didn't develop it.|s^df
me011|you know it was i think it was dave johnson.|s^df
me011|so it's all part of the quicknet library.|s^df
me011|it has all the utilities for it.|s^e
mn017|no p. files were around way before quicknet.|s^ar|s^nd
me011|oh were they?|qy^bh^rt
mn017|p. files were were around when with um rap.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn017|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|it's like the history of icsi.|s^j
mn017|you worked with p. files.|s^bu
fe016|like|%
me011|uhhuh.|b
me018|no.|s^ar
mn017|i worked with p. files.|s
fe016|yeah?|qy^bh^rt
me018|i don't remember what the p.   is though.|s^no
mn017|no.|s^ar
me011|but there are they're|s.%--
me011|the quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle p. files.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|so it works pretty well.|s
fe016|and that isn't really i guess as important as the the main i don't know what you call it the the main sort of word level.|s
me011|neither do i.|s^t3
me018|probably stands for phil.|s
me018|phil kohn.|s^e
me011|it's a phil file?|qy^d^rt
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|that's my guess.|s^na
fe016|huh.|b
fe016|okay.|fg
fe016|well that's really useful.|s^ba
fe016|i mean this is exactly the kind of thing that i wanted to settle.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|so|fh
me011|yeah i've been meaning to look at the atlas stuff again anyway.|s
fe016|great.|s^ba
me011|so just keep|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|i guess it's also sort of a political|s.%--
fe016|i mean if if you feel like that's a community that would be good to tie into anyway then it's sounds like it's worth doing.|s^na
me011|yeah i think it it|s^bk|s.%-
mn017|i think there's|s.%-
me011|and uh as i said i what i did with this stuff i based it on theirs.|s
me011|it's just they hadn't actually come up with an external format yet.|s^df
me011|so now that they have come up with a format it doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it.|s^df
mn017|huh.|b
me011|but let me look at it again.|s^cc
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|great.|s^ba
me011|as i said that|s.%--
fe016|because we actually can start|s.%-
me011|there's one level there's one more level of indirection.|s
me011|and i'm just blanking on exactly how it works.|s
me011|i got to look at it again.|s^cc
fe016|i mean we can start with um i guess this input from dave's.|s^cs
fe016|which you had printed out the channelized input.|s^e
fe016|because he has all of the channels.|s^df
fe016|you know with the channels in the tag and stuff like that.|s^e
me011|yeah i've seen it.|s^bk|s
fe016|so that would be directly|s.%--
me011|yep.|s^bk
fe016|um|fh
me011|easy easy to map.|s^2
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|and so then it would just be a matter of getting making sure to handle the annotations that are you know not at the word level and um to import|s.%-
me001|where are those annotations coming from?|qw^rt
fe016|well right now i jane would would|s^no.%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|are you talking about the overlap annotations?|qy^bu^rt
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|any kind of annotation that like isn't already there.|s^df^na
fe016|uh you know anything you can envision.|s^df
fe008|yeah.|s^bk
fe008|so what i was imagining was um so dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons.|s
fe008|and so put uh a a green ribbon on for an overlap code.|s
fe008|and since we we|s.%--
fe008|i i think it's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now.|s^cs
fe008|and so it's nice to have|s.%--
fe008|however you know you want to have it uh uh located in the discourse.|s^cs
fe008|so|fh
fe008|um|fh
fe008|if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap then you'll have a time marking.|s
fe008|it won't it'll be independent of the time bins.|s
fe008|however these evolve shrink or whatever.|s^e
fe008|increase.|s^e
fe008|or|fh
fe008|also you could have different time bins for different purposes.|s^cs
fe008|and having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique uh you know anchored clear.|s
fe008|and it would just end up on a separate ribbon.|s
fe008|so the overlap coding is going to be easy with respect to that.|s
me011|right.|b
fe008|you look puzzled.|s
me018|i i just i don't quite understand what these things are.|s^no
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|what the codes themselves?|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|uh|fh
me018|well overlap codes.|s
fe008|or the|qrr.%-
me018|i'm not sure what that|s^no.%-
me011|well i mean is that|qy.%--
fe008|well we don't have to go into the codes.|s
me018|it probably doesn't matter.|s
fe008|we don't have to go into the codes.|s^r
me018|no i|%-
me011|i mean it doesn't|s.%--
me011|i mean that not for the topic of this meeting.|s
fe008|but let me just|s^co.%--
fe008|no.|s^ar
fe008|the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon.|s^bs
fe008|you know.|fh
fe008|and and and let's say that this is a time bin.|s
fe008|there's a word here.|s
fe008|this is the first word of an overlapping segment of any length.|s
fe008|overlapping with any other uh word uh segment of any length.|s
fe008|and um|fh
fe008|then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a a backchannel.|s
fe008|or you can say that it was um a usurping of the turn.|s
fe008|or you can you know any any number of categories.|s
fe008|but the fact is you have it time tagged in a way that's independent of the uh particular time bin that the word ends up in.|s
fe008|if it's a large unit or a small unit or|s^e.%--
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe008|we change the boundaries of the units.|s
fe016|right.|b
fe008|it's still unique and and uh fits with the format.|s
fe008|flexible all that.|s^e
mn017|um|fg
mn017|it would be nice|s.%--
mn017|um|fh
mn017|uh this is sort of regarding uh uh it's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion.|s^df
mn017|but when it comes to annotations um you often find yourself in the situation where you have different annotations of the same say word sequence.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|okay?|qy^d^f^g
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|and sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited at one place but not the other.|s
mn017|so once this data gets out there some people might start annotating this for i don't know dialogue acts or um you know topics or what the heck.|s
mn017|you know.|fh
mn017|there's a zillion things that people might annotate this for.|s
mn017|and the only thing that is really sort of common among all the the various versions of this data is the word sequence.|s
fe008|yep.|b
mn017|or approximately|s.%-
fe016|or the time.|s
mn017|or the times.|s^m^na
mn017|but see if you'd annotate dialogue acts you don't necessarily want to or topics you don't really want to be dealing with time marks.|s^ng
fe016|i guess.|fh
mn017|you'd it's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence right?|s^df|qy^d^f^g^rt
fe016|uhhuh.|b
mn017|i mean most people aren't as sophisticated as as we are here with you know uh time alignments and stuff.|s^bd^df
mn017|so|fg
mn017|so the the the point is|s.%-
me011|should should we mention some names on the people who are|qy^cs^j.%--
mn017|right.|b
mn017|so|fh
mn017|um|fh
mn017|the my point is that you're going to end up with uh word sequences that are differently annotated.|s
mn017|and you want some tool uh that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single uh version.|s
mn017|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn017|um and we had this problem very massively uh at s. r. i when we worked uh a while back on uh well on dialogue acts as well as uh you know|fh|s.%--
mn017|um what was it?|fh|qw
mn017|uh|fh
fe016|well all the switchboard in it.|s
mn017|utterance types.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|there's uh automatic uh punctuation and stuff like that.|s
mn017|because we had one set of annotations that were based on uh one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation.|s^df
mn017|and then we had another version that was based on uh a different slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation.|s^df
mn017|so we had these two different versions which were you know you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical.|s
mn017|so it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations.|s
me011|yep.|s^bk
me011|i i don't see any way that file formats are going to help us with that.|s
mn017|no.|s^aa
me011|it's it's all a question of semantic.|s^df
mn017|no.|s^aa^r
mn017|but once you have a file format i can imagine writing not personally but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool um that mediates between various versions.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me011|yeah.|b
mn017|and uh sort of like uh you know you have this thing in unix where you have uh diff.|s^e
me011|diff.|s^2
fe016|w. diff or diff.|s^2
mn017|there's the uh diff that actually tries to reconcile different two diffs based on the same original.|s^df
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|is it s. diff?|qy
me011|yep.|b
fe008|huh.|b.%
mn017|something like that.|s
mn017|um but operating on these lattices that are really what's behind this uh this annotation format.|fh|s
me011|yep.|s^bk
mn017|so|fh
fe016|you could definitely do that with the|s^cs.%-
me011|there's actually a diff library you can use to do things like that that so you have different formats.|s
mn017|so somewhere in the a. p. i you would like to have like a merge or some some function that merges two two versions.|s
me011|yeah i think it's going to be very hard.|s^bk|s^ng
me011|any sort of structured anything when you try to merge is really really hard.|s^df
mn017|right.|b
me011|because you|s^df.%--
me011|the hard part isn't the file format.|s^df
me011|the hard part is specifying what you mean by merge.|s^df
mn017|is|s^2.%-
mn017|exactly.|s^aa
fe016|but the one thing that would work here actually for that is more reliable than the utterances is the the speaker ons and offs.|s^cs
me011|and that's very difficult.|s^ba
fe016|so if you have a good|s.%--
fe016|um|fh
me011|but this is exactly what i mean is that that the problem|s^na.%-
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|you just have to know what to tie it to.|s
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|exactly.|s^aa
me011|the problem is saying what are the semantics.|s:qw
fe016|and|%-
me011|what do you mean by merge.|s:qw
fe016|right right.|s^aa
mn017|right.|b
me011|so|fh
mn017|so so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by uh doing uh by doing hhh|fg|s.%--
mn017|both were based on words.|s
mn017|so we have two versions of the same words you know sprinkled with with different tags for annotations.|s
me011|and then you did diff.|s
mn017|and we did diff.|s
me011|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|exactly.|s^aa
me011|that's just what i thought.|s
mn017|and that's how|s.%-
me011|that's just how i would have done it.|s
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|but you know it had lots of errors.|s
mn017|and things would end up in the wrong order and so forth.|s
mn017|uh|fh
mn017|so|fh
me011|yep.|b
mn017|um if you had a more|fh|s.%--
mn017|uh|fh
mn017|it it was a kluge.|s
mn017|because it was basically reducing everything to uh to uh uh to textual alignment.|s^df
me011|a textual.|s^2
mn017|um|fh
mn017|so|fh
fe016|but|fg
fe016|isn't that something where whoever if if the people who are making changes say in the transcripts because this all happened when the transcripts were different um if they tie it to something like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they|qy.%--
fe016|you know what i mean?|qy^d^f^rt
fe016|then or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time marks that would help.|s
fe016|but the problem is exactly as adam said that you get you know you don't have that information or it's lost in the merge somehow.|s
me011|yep.|b
fe016|so|fh
fe008|well can i ask one question?|qy^rt
fe008|it it seems to me that um we will have an official version of the corpus which will be only one one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned.|s
fe008|we'd still have the the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the|s.%--
mn017|and you're going to get that.|s
fe008|but but|fh
mn017|because if the data gets out people will do all kinds of things to it.|s^df
mn017|and uh you know several years from now you might want to look into um the prosody of referring expressions.|s^e
mn017|and someone at the university of who knows where has annotated the referring expressions.|s^e
me011|right.|b
mn017|so you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data.|s
me011|but unfortunately they've also hand edited it.|s
mn017|okay?|qy^d^f^g
fe008|okay then|%
fe016|but they've also|s.%--
fe016|exactly.|s^aa
fe016|and so that's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data say that you know that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that.|s
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me011|yep.|b
mn017|right.|b
fe008|well then the|%-
me018|what's what's wrong with doing times?|qw^rt
fe008|i agree.|s^aa
me018|i|%-
fe008|that was what i was wondering.|s
fe016|uh yeah time is the|h|s.%--
fe008|time is unique.|s
me011|well|fg
fe008|you were saying that you didn't think we should|s.%--
fe016|time is passing!|s^fe^j
mn017|time time times are ephemeral.|s^j
fe008|andreas was saying|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|fh
me011|what if they haven't notated with them times?|qw
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|he he's a language modeling person though.|s
mn017|um|fh
me011|so so imagine|fg|s.%--
me011|i think his his example is a good one.|s^ba
me011|imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me011|he included references to words.|s
fe008|ach!|%
fe008|well then|%-
me011|he said that at this word is when when it happened.|s
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|or she.|s^ng
fe008|but then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time tied to the word?|qy
me011|or she.|s^m^na
fe016|but still they|s.%-
fe016|exactly.|s^aa
me011|sure.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|but what if what if they change the words?|qw^ng^rt
fe008|not|%--
fe008|well.|fh
fe008|but you'd have some anchoring point.|s
fe008|he couldn't have changed all the words.|s^ng
me018|but can they change the words without changing the time of the word?|qy^rt
me011|sure.|s^aa
me011|but they could have changed it a little.|s^arp
me011|the the point is that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript.|s
me011|so how do you merge it back in?|qw
me011|i understand what you're saying.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|and i i guess the answer is um it's going to be different every time.|s
me011|it's it's just going to be|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b.%
fe016|you only know the boundaries of the|s.%-
me011|it's exactly what i said before.|s
me011|which is that what do you mean by merge.|s
me011|so in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times well what do you mean by merge?|qw
fe016|right.|b
me011|if you tell me what you mean i can write a program to do it.|s
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|you can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that's it.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
me011|and that's about all you can do.|s
fe016|and beyond that all you know is is relative ordering.|s
fe016|and sometimes even that is wrong.|s
me011|so so in so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences.|fg|s
fe016|so|fh
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|extract the times from the best match of theirs to yours.|s
me011|and use that.|s
fe016|and then infer that their time marks are somewhere in between.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
fe016|yeah exactly.|s^aa
fe008|but it could be that they just uh i mean it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
me011|exactly.|s^aa
me011|so it could get very very ugly.|s
fe008|or|%--
fe016|definitely.|s^aa
fe016|definitely.|s^aa
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|all right.|fg
fe016|well i guess i i didn't want to keep people too long.|s^tc
fe008|that's interesting.|s^ba
fe016|and adam wanted people|s.%--
fe016|i'll read the digits.|s^cc
fe016|if anyone else offers to that'd be great.|s
fe016|and|fh
mn017|uh well.|s^t1
fe016|if not i guess|s.%-
me011|yeah.|b
me011|more digits the better.|s
mn017|for for the for the benefit of science we'll read the digits.|s^j
me011|okay.|fg
fe016|thanks thanks a lot.|s^ft
me011|this is|s.%--
fe016|it's really helpful.|s
fe016|i mean adam and don will sort of meet.|s
fe016|and i think that's great.|s^ba
fe016|very useful.|s^ba
fe016|go next.|z
me018|scratch that.|z
me011|oh right.|z
me003|i guess.|s
me011|okay we're on.|s
me011|so just make sure that your wireless mike is on if you're wearing a wireless.|s^cs^rt
me003|check one.|s
me003|check one.|s
me011|and you should be able to see which one which one you're on by uh watching the little bars change.|s
mn015|so which is my bar?|qw
mn015|mah|%--
mn015|number one.|s
me011|yep.|s^aa
me003|sibilance.|s
me003|sibilance.|s
me011|so actually if you guys want to go ahead and read digits now as long as you've signed the consent form that's all right.|s
me003|are we supposed to read digits at the same time?|qy
me011|no.|s^ar
me003|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|no.|s^ar^r
me011|each individually.|s^e
me011|we're talking about doing all at the same time.|s
me011|but i think cognitively that would be really difficult to try to read them while everyone else is.|s
me003|everyone would need extreme focus.|s^na
me011|so when you're reading the digit strings the first thing to do is just say which transcript you're on.|s
me010|other way.|s^t3
me010|we we may wind up with we we may need versions of all this garbage.|s
mn015|for our stuff.|s^2
me010|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
me011|um so the first thing you'd want to do is just say which transcript you're on.|fg|s
me010|yeah.|b
me011|so|fh
me011|you can see the transcript.|s
me011|there's two large number strings on the digits.|s
me011|so you would just read that one.|s
me011|and then you read each line with a small pause between the lines.|s
me011|and the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins.|s
me011|and i'll give i'll read the digit strings first so can see how that goes.|s
me011|um|fh
me011|again i'm not sure how much i should talk about stuff before everyone's here.|s
me010|huh.|b.%
me010|well we have one more coming.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|well why don't i go ahead and read digit strings?|qh^cs
me011|and then we can go on from there.|s^cs^e
me010|okay.|z
me010|well we can start doing it.|z
me011|thanks.|s^ft
me011|so uh just also a note on wearing the microphones.|s
me011|all of you look like you're doing it reasonably correctly.|s
me011|but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth.|s
me011|and then at the corner.|s^e
me011|and that's so that you minimize breath sounds.|s^df
me011|so that when you're breathing you don't breathe into the mike.|s^df
me011|um|fh
me011|yeah that's good.|s^ba
me011|and uh|fh
me011|so everyone needs to fill out only once the speaker form and the consent form.|s
me011|and the short form|s.%--
me011|i mean you should read the consent form.|s
me011|but uh the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit all the transcripts.|s
me011|so if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public which these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them uh you'll be given an opportunity by email uh to bleep out any portions you don't like.|s
me011|um|fh
me011|on the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can.|s
me011|if you're not exactly sure about the region|s.%--
me011|we're not exactly sure either.|s^bd^df
me011|so don't worry too much about it.|s
me011|the it's just self rating.|s
me011|um.|fh
me011|and i think that's about it.|s
me011|i mean should i do you want me to talk at all about why we're doing this and what this project is?|qy^rt
me010|um yeah.|h|s^aa
me011|or|qrr.%--
me010|no there was there was let's see.|s^ar|s
me003|does nancy know that we're meeting in here?|qy
me010|oh|%--
me010|she got an she was notified.|s^na
mn015|i sent an email.|s^na
me003|oh yeah she got an|s^bk|s.%--
me003|yeah yeah.|s^bk
me010|whether she knows is another question.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|so are the people going to be identified by name?|qy^rt
me011|well what we're going to we'll anonymize it in the transcript.|s
me010|right.|s^bk
me011|um but not in the audio.|s^e
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so then in terms of people worrying about uh excising things from the transcript it's unlikely.|s
me011|so|s.%-
me010|since it it isn't attributed.|s^df
me010|oh i see.|s^bk
me010|but the but the but the|s.%-
me011|right so if i said oh hi jerry how are you we're not going to go through and cancel out the jerry s.|s^aa|s:qw
me010|yeah.|b
me010|sure.|s^bk
me011|um so we will go through and in the speaker i. d tags there'll be you know m. one o.   seven m. one o.   eight.|s
me010|right.|b
me010|right.|b
me011|um but uh|fh
me011|um it uh|fh
me011|i don't know a good way of doing it on the audio and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data.|s^no
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|uhhuh.|b
me010|no i i wasn't complaining.|s^df
me010|i just wanted to understand.|s^df
me011|yep.|s^bk
me011|right.|s^bk
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|well we can make up aliases for each of us.|s^cs
me011|yeah i mean whatever you want to do is fine.|fg|s^na
me010|right.|b.%
me012|okay.|b.%
me011|but we find that|s.%--
me011|we want the meeting to be as natural as possible.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me011|so we're trying to do real meetings.|s^df
me011|and so we don't want to have to do aliases.|s
me010|right.|b
me011|and we don't want people to be editing what they say.|s
mn015|right.|b
me010|right.|b
me011|so i think that it's better just as a post process to edit out every time you bash microsoft.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me011|you know.|s^f
me010|right.|b
me010|um okay so why don't you tell us briefly|fg|qh^cs^tc.%--
me010|your give give your normal schpiel.|s^tc
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|so|%-
me011|um so this is the project is called meeting recorder.|s
me011|and there are lots of different aspects of the project.|s
me011|um so my particular interest is in the p. d. a of the future.|s
me011|this is a mock up of one.|s
me011|yes we do believe the p. d. a of the future will be made of wood.|s
me011|um the idea is that you'd be able to put a p. d. a at the table at an impromptu meeting.|fh|s
me011|and record it.|s
me011|and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on on the meeting.|s
me011|so that's my particular interest.|s
me011|is a portable device to do uh information retrieval on meetings.|s
me011|other people are interested in other aspects of meetings.|s
me011|um so the first step on that in any of these is to collect some data.|s
me011|and so what we wanted is a room that's instrumented with both the table top microphones.|s
me011|and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes.|s
me011|as well as the close talking mikes.|s
me011|what the close talking mikes gives us is some ground truth.|s
me011|gives us um high quality audio.|s
me011|um especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus.|s
me011|so for people who are more interested in language we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available.|s
me011|and then also um it's a very very hard task in terms of speech recognition.|s
me011|um and so uh on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results.|s
me011|so we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two.|s
me011|so that's why we're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time.|s^df
me011|and then all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously.|s
me011|so that you can also do things like um beam forming on all the microphones.|s^df
me011|and do research like that.|s
me011|our intention is to release this data to the public um probably through through a body like the l. d. c.|s
me011|and uh just make it as a generally available corpus.|s
me011|um there's other work going on in meeting recording.|fh|s
me011|so we're we're working with s. r. i.|s
me011|with u. w.|s^e
me011|um nist has started an effort which will include video.|h|s^e
me011|we're not including video obviously.|s
me011|and uh and then also um a small amount of assistance from i. b. m.|s
me011|is also involved.|s^e
me011|um oh and the digit strings this is just a more constrained task.|s
me011|um so because the general environment is so challenging we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings.|s
me011|to give ourselves something easier.|s^e
me011|and it's exactly the same digit strings as in t. i. digits.|s
me011|which is a common connected digits corpus.|s
me011|so we'll have some um comparison to be able to be made.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me011|anything else?|qo^rt^t^tc
me010|no.|s^ar
me011|okay so when the last person comes in just have them wear a wireless.|s^bk|s^co
me011|it should be on already.|s
me011|um|fh
me011|either one of those.|s
me011|and uh read the digit strings and and fill out the forms.|s
me011|so the most important form is the consent form.|s
me011|so just be be sure everyone signs that if they consent.|s
mn015|i'm sure it's pretty usual for meetings that people come late.|s
mn015|so you will have to leave what you set.|s
me011|yeah.|s^bk
me011|right.|b
me011|and uh just give me a call.|s
me011|which my number's up there when your meeting is over.|s
me010|yep.|s^bk
me011|and i'm going to leave the mike here.|s
me011|but it's uh but i'm not going to be on.|s
me011|so don't have them use this one.|s
me011|it'll just be sitting here.|s
mn015|input?|qy^d^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|there we go.|s
me010|by the way adam we will be using the uh screen as well.|s
mn015|yep.|b
me010|so you know.|s
me010|wow!|s^ba^fe
me010|organization.|s^t^tc
me010|so you guys who got email about this oh uh friday or something about what we're up to.|s^bu
me003|no.|s^ar
me012|no.|s^ar
mn015|i got it.|s^na
me003|what was the nature of the email?|qw^rt
me010|oh this was about um inferring intentions from features in context and the words.|s
me010|like go to see or visit or|s^e.%-
mn015|i uh i i|%-
me010|you didn't get it?|qy^bu^d
me003|i don't think i did.|s^nd
me010|i guess these have got better filters.|s
me010|because i sent it to everybody.|s^df
me010|you just blew it off.|s
me003|uh.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|it's really simple though.|s
mn015|so this is the idea.|s
mn015|um|fh
mn015|we could pursue um if we thought it's it's worth it but uh i think we we will agree on that um to come up with a with a sort of very very first crude prototype.|s
mn015|and do some implementation work and do some some research and some modeling.|s
mn015|so the idea is if you want to go somewhere|s.%--
mn015|um and|fh
mn015|focus on that object down|s^co.%--
mn015|oh i can actually walk with this.|s^t1
mn015|this is nice.|s^ba^t1
mn015|down here.|s^co
mn015|that's the powder tower.|s
mn015|now um we found in our uh data and from experiments that there's three things you can do.|s
mn015|um you can walk this way and come really really close to it.|fh|s
mn015|and touch it.|s^e
mn015|but you cannot enter or do anything else.|s
mn015|unless you're interested in rock climbing it won't do you no good standing there.|s
mn015|it's just a dark alley.|s
mn015|but you can touch it.|s
mn015|if you want to actually go up or into the tower you have to go this way.|s
mn015|and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth.|s
mn015|if you actually want to see the tower and that's what actually most people want to do is just have a good look of it take a picture for the family you have to go this way and go up here.|s
mn015|and there you have a really view it exploded the during the thirty.|s
mn015|really uh interesting sight.|s
me003|huh.|b
mn015|and um these uh these lines are um paths.|fh|s^rt
mn015|or that's uh|s.%--
mn015|the street network of our geographic information system.|s
mn015|and you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part.|s
mn015|because otherwise we couldn't get our g. i. s system to take to lead people this way.|s^df
mn015|it would always use the closest point to the object.|s
mn015|and then the tourists would be faced you know in front of a wall.|s
mn015|but it would do them absolutely no good.|s
mn015|so what we found interesting is first of all intentions differ.|s
mn015|maybe you want to enter a building.|s
mn015|maybe you want to see it.|s
mn015|take a picture of it.|s
mn015|or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building.|s
mn015|for whatever reason that may be.|s
me003|what's it what's it made out of?|qw
mn015|um red limestone.|s^rt
me003|so maybe you would want to touch it.|s
mn015|yeah maybe you would want to touch it.|s^aa|s^m^na
mn015|um|fh
mn015|okay i this um these intentions we we could if we want to call it the the vista mode.|s^rt
mn015|where we just want to uh get the overview or look at it.|s^rt
mn015|the enter mode.|s
mn015|and the well tango mode.|s
mn015|i always come up with with silly names.|s
mn015|so this tango means literally translated to touch.|s
mn015|so but sometimes the the tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that um if you want to uh|s.%--
mn015|if you don't have the intention of entering your building but you know that something is really close to it and you just want to approach it or get to that building|s.%--
mn015|consider for example the post office in chicago a building so large that it has its own zip code.|s
mn015|so the entrance could be miles away from the closest point.|s
mn015|so sometimes it makes sense maybe to to distinguish there.|s
mn015|so um i've looked uh through twenty some|s.%--
mn015|uh i didn't look through all the data.|s^bd^df
mn015|um and there there's uh a lot more different ways in people uh the ways people phrase how to get if they want to get to a certain place.|s
mn015|and sometimes here it's it's a little bit more obvious.|s
mn015|um maybe i should go back a couple of steps.|fh|s
mn015|and go through the|s.%-
me010|no okay come in sit down.|s^bk|s^co
me010|if you grab yourself a microphone.|s^co
mn015|you need to sign some stuff and read some digits.|s
me010|well you can sign afterwards.|s
mn015|or later.|s
me003|you have to also have to read some digits.|s
me010|afterwards.|s
fe004|okay afterwards is fine.|s^bk|s
mn015|they are uncomfortable.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|really small?|qy^d^rt
fe004|okay i see.|s^bk|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|yep.|b
fe004|thank you.|s^ft
mn015|okay but that was our idea.|fg|s^t^tc
me010|and it it it it also has to be switched on nance.|s
mn015|is|%-
me003|no that one's already on i thought he said.|s^ar|s^nd
mn015|i i think|%-
me010|it's on?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|okay good.|s^bk|s^ba
me003|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|okay it's on.|s^bk|s^na
mn015|okay that was the idea.|fg|s
mn015|um people when they when they want to go to a building sometimes they just want to look at it.|s^rt
mn015|sometimes they want to enter it.|s^rt
mn015|and sometimes they want to get really close to it.|s
mn015|that's something we found.|s
mn015|it's just a truism.|s
mn015|and the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes incredibly different.|s
mn015|i i gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it.|s
mn015|so this is sort of how people may uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock up system at least that's the way they did it.|s^rt
mn015|and we get tons of of these how do i get to i want to go to.|s:qw
mn015|but also give me directions to and i would like to see.|s:s
mn015|and um what we can sort of do if we look closer closer at the the data|fh|s.%--
mn015|that was the wrong one.|s
mn015|um we can look at some factors that may make a difference.|s
mn015|first of all|s.%--
mn015|very important.|s^ba
mn015|and um that i've completely forgot that when we talked.|s
mn015|this is of course a crucial factor what type of object is it.|s:qw
mn015|so some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of.|s
mn015|or very rarely.|s^e
mn015|but you usually want to enter them.|s
mn015|some objects are more picturesque.|s
mn015|and you more more highly photographed.|s^e
mn015|then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants.|s
mn015|um sometimes i found in the uh looking at the data in a superficial way i found some sort of modifiers that that may also give us a hint.|fh|s
mn015|um i'm trying to get to.|fh|s:s
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|i need to get to.|s:s
mn015|sort of hints to the fact that you're not really sightseeing and and just there for pleasure and so forth and so on.|s
mn015|and this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered.|s
mn015|that whatever it is you're doing at the moment may also influence the interpretation of of a phrase.|s
mn015|so this is uh really|s.%--
mn015|uh uh uh|fh
mn015|my suggestion is really simple.|s^rt
mn015|we start with um|s.%--
mn015|now let me uh say one more thing.|s
mn015|what we do know is that the parser we use in the smartkom system will never differentiate between any of these.|s
mn015|so basically all of these things will result in the same x. m. l m. three l. structure.|s
mn015|sort of action go.|s^rt
mn015|and then an object.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|and a source.|s^e
mn015|so it's it's it's way too crude to capture those differences in intentions.|s
mn015|so i thought huh.|s^rt:s^fe
mn015|maybe for a deep understanding task that's a nice sort of playground or first little thing.|s
mn015|where we can start it and sort of look|s.%--
mn015|okay we need we going to get those m. three l. structures.|s
mn015|the crude undifferentiated parse.|s
mn015|interpreted input.|s^e
mn015|we may need additional part of speech or maybe just some information on the verb and modifiers auxiliaries.|s
mn015|we'll see.|s^rt
mn015|and i will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there.|s^cc^rt
mn015|and maybe we want to get a switch for the context.|s
mn015|so this is not something which we can actually monitor now.|s
mn015|but just is something we can set.|s
mn015|and then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program depending on on what um comes out.|s
mn015|we want to have an a structure resulting|s.%--
mn015|if we feed it through a belief net or or something along those lines we'd get an inferred intention we we produce a structure that differentiates between the vista the enter and the um tango mode.|s
mn015|which i think we maybe want to ignore.|s
mn015|but that's my idea.|s^rt
mn015|it's up for discussion.|s
mn015|we can change all of it.|s
mn015|any bit of it.|s
mn015|throw it all away.|s
me012|now this email that you sent actually.|s
me010|what?|qw^br
me012|now i remember the email.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me003|huh.|b
me003|still i have no recollection whatsoever of the email.|s
me003|i'll have to go back and check.|s
me010|not important.|s^ba^bd
me010|so what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is.|s
me010|and the the uh robert and i talked about this some on friday.|s
me010|and we think it's well formed.|fh|s
me010|so we think it's a well formed uh starter task for this uh deeper understanding in the tourist domain.|s
me012|so where exactly is the uh deeper understanding being done?|qw
me012|like i mean is it before the bayes-net?|qy
me012|is it uh|qy.%--
me010|well it's the it's it's always all of it.|s
me010|so in general it's always going to be the answer is everywhere.|s
me010|uh so the notion is that uh this isn't real deep.|s
me010|but it's deep enough that you can distinguish between these three quite different kinds of uh going to see some tourist thing.|s
me010|and so that's that's the quote deep that we're trying to get at.|s
me010|and robert's point is that the current front end doesn't give you any way to|s.%--
me010|not only doesn't it do it but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it.|s
me010|it isn't like if you just took what the front end gives you and used some clever inference algorithm on it you would be able to figure out which of these is going on.|s
me010|so uh|fh
me010|and this is in general it's going to be true of any kind of deep understanding.|s
me010|there's going to be contextual things.|s
me010|there're going to be linguistic things.|s
me010|there're going to be discourse things.|s
me010|and they got to be combined.|s
me010|and my idea on how to combine them is with a belief net.|s
me010|although it may turn out that some totally different thing is going to work better.|s^bd^df
me010|um the idea would be that you uh take your|fh|s.%--
me010|you're editing your slide?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yeah as sort of as i get ideas.|s^aa|s
mn015|uh uh|%--
me010|oh.|s^bk
mn015|so discourse i i i thought about that.|s^df
mn015|of course that needs to sort of go in there.|s
me010|oh i'm sorry.|s^bk|s^fa
me010|okay so this is minutes taking minutes as we go.|fg|s
me010|in his in his own way.|s^e
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me010|um but the the|s.%--
me010|anyway so the thing is uh naively speaking you've you've got a for this little task a belief net.|fg|s
me010|which is going to have as output the conditional probability of one of three things.|s
me010|that the person wants to uh to view it to enter it or to tango with it.|s:s
me010|um|fh
me010|so that the the output of the belief net is pretty well formed.|s
me010|and then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things.|s
me010|and then the question is|s.%--
me010|there are two questions.|s
me010|is uh one where do you get this information from?|qh
me010|and two what's the structure of the belief net?|qh
me010|so what are the conditional probabilities of this that and the other given these things?|qh^e
me010|and you probably need intermediate nodes.|s
me010|i we don't know what they are yet.|s^no
me010|so it may well be that uh for example that uh knowing whether|s.%--
me010|oh another thing you want is some information i think about the time of day.|s
me010|now they may want to call that part of context.|s
me010|but the time of day matters a lot.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|and if things are obviously closed then you|s.%-
mn015|people won't want to enter it.|s^2
me010|people don't want to enter them.|s^m^na
me010|and if it's not obvious you may want to actually uh point out to people that it's closed you know what they're going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it.|s
me010|so another thing that can come up and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is that another option of course is to have a more of a dialogue.|s
me010|so if someone says something you could ask them.|s
me003|yeah.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|and now one thing you could do is always ask them.|s
me010|but that's boring.|s^bd^df
me010|and it also it also be a pain for the person using it.|s
me010|so one thing you could do is build a little system that said whenever you got a question like that i've got one of three answers.|s
me010|ask them which one you want.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|but that's um not what we're going to do.|s
mn015|but maybe that's a false state of the system that it's too close to call.|s
me010|oh yeah.|s^aa
me010|you want the you want the ability to you want the ability to ask.|s
me010|but what you don't want to do is build a system that always asks every time.|s
me010|and|s.%--
me010|that's not getting at the scientific problem.|s^df
me010|and it's|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|in general you're you know it's going to be much more complex than that.|s
me010|this is purposely a really simple case.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|so uh|fh
me010|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|i have one more point to to bhaskara's question.|s^tc
mn015|um i think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um want it in terms of our modeling.|s
mn015|we can start you know basic from human beings.|s
mn015|model that.|s
mn015|its motions.|s
mn015|going walking seeing.|s^e
mn015|we can model all of that.|s
mn015|and then compose whatever inferences we make out of these really conceptual primitives.|s
mn015|that will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding.|s
me010|yeah so so the way that might come up if you want to suppose you wanted to do that you might say um as an intermediate step in your belief net is there a source path goal schema involved?|fg|qh
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|and if so uh is there a focus on the goal?|qh
me010|or is there a focus on the path?|qh
me010|or something.|s
me010|and that could be uh one of the|s.%--
me010|you know the in some piece of the belief net that could be the the appropriate thing to enter.|s
me012|so where would we extract that information from?|qw
me012|from the m. three l..|s^bu^e^rt
me010|no.|s^ar
me010|no see the m. three l. is not going to give|s^ar^r|s^df.%--
me010|what he was saying is the m. three l. does not have any of that.|s
me010|all it has is some really crude stuff saying a person wants to go to a place.|s:s
me012|right.|b
me003|the m. three l. is the old smartkom output.|s^bu
me010|right.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|m. well m. three l. itself refers to multimedia markup language.|s
me003|it's just a language.|s
me003|right yeah.|s^aa
me010|so we have we we have to have a better way of referring to|s.%-
mn015|the parser output?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b
me010|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|analyzed speech i think it's what they call it.|s
me010|the|%-
me010|well okay.|s^am
mn015|really oder|%-
me010|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|no actually intention lattices is what we're going to get.|s
me010|but they they call it intention lattice.|s
me010|but|%-
mn015|intention lattice hypothesis.|s
me010|anyway|fg
mn015|they call it intention hypotheses.|s
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|so they're going to give us some uh or we can assume that you get this crude information.|s
me010|about intention.|s^e
me010|and that's all they're going to provide.|s
me010|and they don't give you the kind of object.|s
me010|they don't give you any discourse history.|s
me010|if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else.|s
mn015|well they keep it.|s
mn015|we have to request it.|s^e
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|but it's not in there.|s
me010|well they they they keep it by their lights.|s
me010|it may it may or may not be what what we want.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|yeah or|%-
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me003|so if someone says i want to touch the side of the powder tower that would basically we need to pop up tango mode and the and the directions?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|if if yeah if it got as simple as that yeah.|s^na|s^aa
me003|yeah.|s^bk
me010|but it wouldn't.|s^df
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|but that doesn't necessarily|s.%--
me003|but we'd have to infer a source path goal to some degree for touching the side right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|well uh there is a a point there if i understand you correct.|fg|s
mn015|um|fh
mn015|because um sometimes people just say things.|s^df
mn015|this you find very often.|s
mn015|where is the city hall.|s:qw
mn015|and this they don't want to see it on a map.|s
mn015|or they don't want to know it's five hundred yards away from you or that it's to the your north.|s^rt
mn015|they want to go there.|s
mn015|that's what they say is where is it.|s:qw
mn015|where is that damn thing.|s:qw
me003|and the parser would output|s.%--
mn015|well that's a a question mark.|s
mn015|a lot of parsers um|s.%--
mn015|just uh|%--
mn015|that's way beyond their scope is of interpreting that.|s
mn015|you know.|s^f
mn015|but um|fh
mn015|still outcome the outcome will be some form of structure.|s
mn015|with the town hall and maybe saying it's a w. h focus on the town hall.|s
mn015|but to interpret it|s.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|you know.|s^f^rt
mn015|somebody else has to do that job later.|s
me003|i'm just trying to figure out what the smartkom system would output.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me003|depending on these things.|s^e
mn015|um it will probably tell you how far away it is.|s
mn015|at least that's that's even what deep map does.|s
mn015|it tells you how far away it is.|s^rt
mn015|and and shows it to you on a map.|s
mn015|because we can not differentiate at the moment between you know the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just wanting to know where where it is.|s^df
fe004|people might not be able to infer that either right?|s|qy^d^g
fe004|like the fact like i could imagine if someone came up to me and asked where's the city hall i might say are you trying to get there.|s:qw
fe004|because how i describe um its location uh probably depend on whether i think i should give them you know directions now or say you know whatever it's half a mile away or something like that.|s^df
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|it's a granularity factor.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|because where people ask you where is new york you will tell them it's on the east coast.|s^df:qw
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah exactly.|s^aa
fe004|right.|b
mn015|uh you won't tell them how to get there you know take that bus to the airport and blah blah blah.|s^df^e
fe004|right.|b
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|right.|s^aa
mn015|but if it's the post office you will tell them how to get there.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so they have done some interesting experiments on that in hamburg as well.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|right.|b
mn015|so|fh
me010|but|fg
me010|go go back to the the uh|s.%--
me010|yeah that slide.|s^aa|s
mn015|so i this is onto is is knowledge about buildings.|fg|s
mn015|their opening times.|s
mn015|and then coupled with time of day um this should|s.%--
mn015|you know.|s^f
fe004|so that context was like um their presumed purpose context.|s^bu
fe004|like business or travel.|s
fe004|as well as the utterance context like i'm now standing at this place at this time.|s^e
me010|yeah well i think we ought to as we have all along we we've been distinguishing between situational context.|fg|s
me010|which is what you have as context.|s
me010|and discourse context.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|which you have as d. h.|s
me010|i don't know what the h.   means.|s^no
mn015|nuh.|b
mn015|history.|s
mn015|discourse history.|s^e
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|whatever.|s^bd
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|so we can work out terminology later.|s^cs
mn015|yep.|s^bk
me010|so they're they're quite distinct.|s
me010|i mean you need them both.|s^df
me010|but they're quite distinct.|s
me010|and so what we were talking about doing as a first shot is not doing any of the linguistics.|s
me010|except to find out what seems to be useful.|s
me010|so the the the reason the belief net is in blue is the notion would be|s.%--
me010|uh this may be a bad bad idea.|s^bd^df
me010|but the idea is to take as a first goal see if we could actually build a belief net that would make this three way distinction uh in a plausible way.|s^rt
me010|given|s.%--
me010|these we have all these transcripts.|s
me010|and we're able to by hand extract the features to put in the belief net.|s
me010|saying aha.|s:s^bk
me010|here are the things which if you get them out of out of the language and discourse and put them into the belief net it would tell you which of these three uh intentions is most likely.|s^e:s
me010|and if to actually do that build it um you know run it run it on the data where you hand transcribe the parameters.|s
me010|and see how that goes.|s
me010|if that goes well then we can start worrying about how we would extract them.|s
me010|so where would you get this information?|qh
me010|and expand it to to other things like this.|s
me010|but if we can't do that then we're in trouble.|s
me010|i mean if you can't do this task|s.%--
me010|um|fh
mn015|we need a different uh engine.|s^2^cs
me010|uh uh yeah or something.|s^aa|s
mn015|machine i mean.|s^bsc
me010|well it if it if it's the belief nets we'll switch to you know logic or some terrible thing.|s
me010|but i don't think that's going to be the case.|s
me010|i think that uh if we can get the information a belief net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it.|s
me010|the real issue is what are the factors involved in determining this?|qh
me010|and i don't know.|s^no^rt
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|but only|s.%-
me010|hold on a hold on a second.|s^co
mn015|muh|%-
me010|so i know.|s
me010|uh uh is it clear what's going on here?|qy^rt
me012|yep.|s^aa
fe004|um i missed the beginning.|s^df
fe004|but um|fh
fe004|i guess|s.%--
fe004|could you back to the slide?|qy^rt
fe004|the previous one.|s^e^rt
fe004|so is it that it's um|qy^bu.%--
fe004|these are all factors that uh these are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|or that we want to take into account?|qrr
fe004|you were saying|s.%-
me010|take them into account.|s
fe004|take the the linguistic factors too.|s
me010|but but you don't worry about|s.%-
fe004|oh how to extract these features.|s^bk|s^2
me010|how to extract them.|s^m^na
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|so let's find out which ones we need first.|s
fe004|got it.|s^bk
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|and and it's clear from the data um like sort of the correct answer in each case.|s^bu
me010|and|%-
me010|no.|s^ar
fe004|but|%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|no.|s^ar
fe004|that's that's the thing i'm curious|s.%-
mn015|but|%-
me010|let's go back to let's go back to the the the slide of data.|s^cs
fe004|like do we know from the data which|qy.%--
mn015|um|%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so|fh
mn015|not from that data.|s^nd
mn015|but um since we are designing a a a an compared to this even bigger data collection effort um we will definitely take care to put it in there.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|in some shape way form over the other.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|to see whether we can then get sort of empirically validated data.|s
fe004|right.|b
mn015|um from this we can sometimes you know|s.%--
mn015|and that's that but that isn't that what we need for a belief net anyhow?|qh^df
mn015|is sort of|s.%--
mn015|sometimes when people want to just see it they phrase it more like this.|s^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|but it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently even if they still|s.%--
fe004|right.|s^aa
fe004|right.|b
mn015|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|but then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief net.|s
fe004|right.|b
mn015|so um this is exactly what|s.%--
mn015|because you can never be sure.|s^df
mn015|and i'm sure even the most sort of deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say well if it's phrased like that the intention is this.|s:s
fe004|sure.|b
mn015|you know because then uh you|s.%-
fe004|i mean the only way you could get that is if you were to give the subjects a task.|s
fe004|right?|qy^d^f^g
fe004|where you have where your uh current goal is to|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|that's what we're doing.|s
fe004|so that's what you want?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|but but we will still get the phrasing all over the place.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so you will know.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|i'm sure that you know|s.%-
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|the no that's fine.|s
fe004|i guess it's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|from that task yeah.|s^2|s^aa
me010|so uh i think you all know this but we are going to actually use this little room.|fg|s
me010|and start recording subjects probably within a month or something.|s
me010|so this is not any any of you guys' worry.|s
me010|except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need.|s
me010|so our job is to figure out how to solve these problems.|s
me010|if it turns out that we need data of a certain sort then the sort of data collection branch can be uh asked to do that.|s
me010|and one of the reasons why we're recording the meeting for these guys is because we want their help when we we start doing uh recording of subjects.|s
me010|so yeah you're absolutely right though.|s^ba
me010|no you you will not have|s.%--
me010|and there it is.|s
me010|and uh|fh
me010|but you know|s.%--
me010|the um|fh
fe004|and i think the other concern that has come up before too is if it's|s.%--
fe004|um|fh
fe004|i don't know if this was collected what situation this data was collected in.|s^no
fe004|was it is it the one that you showed in your talk?|qy^rt
fe004|like people|s.%-
mn015|no no.|s^ar
fe004|but|%--
mn015|no.|s^ar^r
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so was this like someone actually mobile like using a device?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|uh|h
mn015|no not|s^ar|%--
mn015|it was mobile.|s^aap
mn015|but not not with a a real wizard system.|s
mn015|so there were never answers.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|okay okay.|s^bk
fe004|but is it|qy.%--
fe004|i guess i don't know the situation of of collecting the data.|s^no
fe004|of like here you could imagine them being walking around the city as like one situation.|s^e
fe004|and then you have all sorts of other situational context factors that would influence how to interpret like you said the scope and things like that.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|if they're doing it in a|s.%--
fe004|you know i'm sitting here with a map and asking questions.|s
fe004|i i would imagine that the data would be really different.|s
fe004|um so it's just|fh|s.%--
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|but it was never the goal of that data collection to to serve for for such a purpose.|s^df
mn015|so that's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|there was there was no label.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|right.|b
mn015|you know intention a.   intention b.   intention c.  .|s^e
mn015|or task a.   b.   c.  .|s^e
mn015|um|fh
mn015|i'm sure we can produce some if we need it.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|um that that will help us along those lines.|s
mn015|but you know you got to leave something for other people to model.|s
mn015|so to finding out what you know situational what the contextual factors of the situation really are you know is an interesting interesting thing.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|sort of i'm at the moment curious and i'm i'm want to approach it from the end where we can sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|what suffices and what doesn't.|s
mn015|and then we can start worrying about where to get this input.|s
mn015|what what do we need you know?|qh
mn015|ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser for example maybe there's just a couple three things we need to do.|s^rt
mn015|and then we get more whatever part of speech and more construction type like stuff out of it.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|it's a pragmatic approach uh at the moment.|s
me003|how exactly does the data collection work?|qw
me003|do they have a map?|qy^e
me003|and then you give them a scenario of some sort.|s^bu^e
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|imagine you're the the subject.|s
mn015|you're going to be in here.|s^rt
mn015|and somebody|s.%--
mn015|and and you see uh either the three d. model or uh a quicktime animation of standing in a square in heidelberg.|s
mn015|so you actually see that.|s
mn015|um the uh|fh
mn015|um first thing is you have to read a text about heidelberg.|s
mn015|so just off a textbook uh tourist guide to familiarize uh yourself with that sort of odd sounding german street names like fischergasse and so forth.|s
mn015|so that's part one.|s
mn015|part two is you're told that this huge new wonderful computer system exists that can tell you everything you want to know.|s
mn015|and it understands you completely.|s
mn015|and so you're going to pick up that phone.|s
mn015|dial a number.|s
mn015|and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve.|s
mn015|first you have to know find out how to get to that place.|s
mn015|maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there.|s
mn015|maybe so the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild.|s
mn015|the third one is to get information on the history of an object.|s
mn015|the fourth one|s.%--
mn015|and then the system breaks down.|s
mn015|it crashes.|s^rt
fe004|at the third?|qy^bu^d
mn015|and|%-
fe004|right then.|s^e
mn015|after the third task.|s^ng
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and then|s.%--
mn015|or after the fourth.|s
mn015|some find forget that for now.|s^co
mn015|and then a human operator comes on and and apologizes that the system has crashed.|s^rt
mn015|but you know urges you to continue you know?|s|qy^d^f^g
mn015|now with a human operator.|s
mn015|and so you have basically the same tasks again.|s
mn015|just with different objects.|s
mn015|and you go through it again.|s^rt
mn015|and that was it.|s
mn015|oh and one one little bit.|fg|s
mn015|and uh the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are via g. p. s.|s
mn015|when the human operator comes on um that person does not know.|s
mn015|so the g. p. s is crashed as well.|s^rt
mn015|so the person first has to ask you where are you.|s:qw
mn015|and so you have to do some tell the person sort of where you are depending on what you see there.|s
mn015|um this is a a a a a bit that i i don't think we|s.%--
mn015|did we discuss that bit?|qy^rt
mn015|uh i just sort of squeezed that in now.|s
mn015|but it's something uh that would provide some very interesting data for some people i know.|s
mn015|so|fh
fe004|so in the display you can oh you said that you you might have a display that shows like the|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|additionally you have a a a sort of a map type display.|s
fe004|a your perspective sort of?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|and so as you|s.%-
mn015|uh two d..|s^arp
fe004|oh two d..|s^bk|s^bk^m
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|two d..|s^na^r
fe004|so as you move through it they just track it on the for themselves.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|you don't|s.%--
fe004|there.|%
mn015|that's|s.%--
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
mn015|i but i don't think you really move.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|sort of.|s^e
fe004|so|%-
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|i mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort.|s^df
mn015|unless we would|s.%--
mn015|we can show it walks to you know.|s
mn015|we can have movies of walking.|s
mn015|you walking through through heidelberg and ultimately arriving there.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|maybe we want to do that.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|uh i was just trying to figure out how how ambitious the system is.|s^df
mn015|the map was sort of intended to|s.%--
mn015|you want to go to that place.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|you know and it's sort of there.|s
mn015|and you see the label of the name.|s^rt
mn015|so we get those names pronunciation stuff and so forth.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and we can change that.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so your tasks don't require you to|s^bu.%--
fe004|i mean uh you're told so when your task is i don't know go buy stamps or something like that.|s^rt
fe004|so do you have to respond?|qy^rt
fe004|or does your|qrr.%--
fe004|uh what are you what are you supposed to be telling the system?|qw
fe004|like|%--
fe004|what you're doing now?|qh^bu^rt
fe004|or|qrr.%--
mn015|well we'll see what people do.|s
fe004|there's no|s.%-
fe004|okay so it's just like let's figure out what they would say under the circumstances.|s^bk|s
mn015|yeah and and we will record both sides.|s^aa|s
mn015|i mean we will record the the wizard.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|i mean in both cases it's going to be a human in the computer and in the operator case.|s^rt
mn015|and we will there will be some dialogue you know.|s
mn015|so you first have to do this and that.|s
fe004|yep.|b
mn015|and and|fh
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|see what they say.|s
mn015|we can instruct the uh wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be.|s
mn015|but um|fh
mn015|maybe the maybe what you're suggesting|s.%--
mn015|is what you're suggesting that it might be too poor the data if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one uh task results in a question and then there's an answer and that's the end of the task?|qy^bu^rt
mn015|you want to have it more more steps sort of.|s^bu^e
fe004|yeah i i don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction|s^aa|s.%--
fe004|i mean they're unfamiliar with interacting with the system.|s
fe004|all they know is it's this great system that could do stuff.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|oh yeah but to some extent this is a different discussion.|fg|s
fe004|right?|qy^d^f^g
fe004|so|fh
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|so uh we we have to have this discussion of the experiment and the data collection and all that sort of stuff.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and we do have um a student who is a candidate for wizard.|s
me010|uh she's going to get in touch with me.|s
me010|it's a student of eve's.|s
me010|f. e. y.|s
me010|fey?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|spelled f. e. y.|s^e^rt
me010|do you do you|qy.%-
fe004|oh fey parrill.|s^bk|s
me010|you know her?|qy^bu^d
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|is|qy.%-
fe004|she started taking the class last year.|s
fe004|and then didn't um you know didn't continue.|s
fe004|i she's a|%-
fe004|is she an|qy.%-
me010|she's graduated.|s
fe004|she is a graduate okay.|s^m|s^bk
me010|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|yeah i i know her very very briefly.|s^bk|s
fe004|i know she was you know interested in aspect and stuff like that.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so anyway she's looking for some more part time work while she's waiting actually for graduate school.|fg|s
me010|and she'll be in touch.|s
me010|so we may have someone uh to do this.|s
me010|and she's got you know some background in in all this stuff.|s
me010|and is a linguist|s.%--
me010|and so|fh
me010|so that's so nancy we'll have at some point we'll have another discussion on exactly you know how that's going to go.|fg|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and um jane but also uh liz have offered to help us do this uh data collection and design and stuff.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|huh.|b
me010|so when we get to that we'll have some people doing it that know what they're doing.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|i guess the reason i was asking about the sort of the the details of this kind of thing is that um it's one thing to collect data for i don't know speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty clear correct answers.|s^df
fe004|but with intention um obviously as you point out there's a lot of other factors.|s
fe004|and i'm not really sure um how how the question of how to make it a appropriate toy version of that um it's it's just hard.|s
fe004|so i mean obviously it's a|s.%-
me003|yeah uh actually i guess that was my question.|fg|s^na
me003|is the intention implicit in the scenario that's given?|qy
me003|like do the|qy.%-
fe004|it is if they have these tasks that they're supposed to|s^na.%-
me003|yeah i just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was.|s^aa|s^df^no
fe004|to to give|s.%-
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|uh|%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn015|no one is at the moment.|s^ba
fe004|right.|b
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|so that's part of what we'll have to figure out.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but uh|fh
me010|the the problem that i was going to try to focus on today was let's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which one way or the other you were able to uh figure out both the intention.|s^t^tc
me010|and set the context.|s^e
me010|and know what language was used.|s^e
me010|so let's suppose that we can get that kind of data.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|the issue is can we find a way to basically featurize it?|qh
me010|so that we get some discrete number of features so that uh when we know the values to all those features or as many as possible we can come up with the best estimate of which of the in this case three little intentions are most likely.|s
fe004|what are the three intentions?|qw^rt
fe004|is it to go there to see it and|qy^bu.%-
mn015|to come as close as possible to it.|s^2
me010|the terminology we're using is to|s.%-
fe004|yeah it's.|s^aa|%
me010|go back.|s^co
me010|to|%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|to view it.|s
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|to enter it.|s
me010|now those it seems to me those are you you have no trouble with those being distinct.|s
me010|take a picture of it.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|you you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and for an object that's at all big uh sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh could be quite different than either of those.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|just sort of|s.%--
fe004|okay so now i understand the referent of tango mode.|s^bk|s
me003|see i would have thought it was more of a waltz.|s^ng
fe004|i didn't get that before.|s^df
mn015|to waltz it?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|yeah like how close are you going to be?|s^aa|qh^e
me010|well|%-
fe004|like tango's really close.|s^ba
me003|yeah because a tango|s^aa|s^df.%-
me003|yeah.|s^aa
me010|well anyway|fg
me012|all these|%-
me010|so|%-
me012|so like the question is how what features can like do you want to try to extract from say the parse or whatever.|s^bu
me010|right.|s^aa
me012|like the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh stem or certain construction or whatever|s^e.%--
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|is there a construction or the kind of object?|qh
me010|or uh anything else that's in the it's either in the in the the discourse itself or in the context.|s^e
me010|so if it turns out that whatever it is you want to know whether the person's uh a tourist or not okay that becomes a feature.|s
me010|now how you determine that is another issue.|s
me010|but for the current problem it would just be okay if you can be sure that it's a tourist versus a businessman versus a native or something uh that would give you a lot of discriminatory power.|s:s
me010|and then just have a little section in your belief net that said pppt.|s:s^fe
me010|though in the short run you'd set them.|s
me012|uhhuh.|b
me010|and see how it worked.|s
me010|and then in the longer run you would figure out how you could derive them from previous discourse or anything else you knew.|s
me012|right.|b.%
me012|so how should what's the uh plan?|qw
me012|like how should we go about figuring out these|qw^e.%-
me010|okay so first of all is|s^bk|s.%--
me010|uh do either of you guys you got a favorite belief net that you've you know played with?|fh|qy
me010|javabayes or something.|s^e
me012|oh.|s^bk
me012|no not really.|s^ar|s^nd
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|well anyway get one.|fg|s^co
me010|okay so so one of one of the things we want to do is actually uh pick a package.|s^bk|s
me010|doesn't matter which one.|s
me010|uh presumably one that's got good interactive abilities.|s
me010|because a lot of what we're going to be|s^df.%--
me010|you know we don't need the one that'll solve massive uh belief nets quickly.|s
me010|these are not going to get big in in the foreseeable future.|s
me010|but we do want one in which it's easy to interact with and uh modify.|s
me010|because that's a lot of what it's going to be is um playing with this.|s^df
me010|and probably one in which it's easy to have um what amounts to transcript files.|s
me010|so that if if we have all these cases|s.%--
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|so we make up cases that have these features.|s
me010|okay and then you'd like to be able to say okay here's a bunch of cases|s.%--:s
me010|there're even ones that you can do learning.|s
me010|okay so you have all their cases and and their results.|s
me010|and you have a algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the the probabilities for you.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|probably that's not worth it.|s
me010|i mean my guess is we aren't going to have enough data that's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it.|s^df
me010|but i don't know.|s^df^no
me010|so i would say you the first task for you two guys is to um pick a package.|s
me010|okay and you want to it you know the standard things.|s
me010|you want it stable you want it|s^e.%--
me010|yeah.|%
me010|and as soon as we have one we can start trying to uh make a first cut at what's going on.|s
mn015|nuh|%-
me010|but it what i like about it is it's very concrete.|s
me010|okay we we have a we know what the outcomes are going to be.|s
me010|and we have some some data that's loose.|s
me010|we can use our own intuition.|s
me010|and see how hard it is.|s
me010|and importantly what intermediate nodes we think we need.|s
me010|so it if it turns out that just thinking about the problem you come up with things you really need to you know this is the kind of thing that is you know an intermediate little piece in your belief net that'd be really interesting.|s
me003|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and it and it may serve as a platform for a person maybe me or whoever who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis.|s
mn015|i mean we have the framenet group here.|s
mn015|and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already.|s
mn015|that are contained in the data.|s^e
mn015|um you know to come up with a nice little set of features.|fh|s
mn015|and um maybe even means of uh extracting them.|fh|s
mn015|and and that altogether could also be uh become a nice paper that's going to be published somewhere if we sit down and write it.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|when you said javabayes belief net you were talking about ones that run on coffee?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|or that are in the program language java?|qrr
me010|no it turns out that there is a uh the new end of java libraries.|s^ar|s
me010|okay and it turns out one called javabayes.|s
me010|which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|okay.|b
me010|i have no idea whether that's|s^no.%--
me010|the obvious advantage of that is that you can then relatively easily get all the other java packages for guis or whatever else you might want to do.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that that's i think why a lot of people doing research use that.|s
me010|but it may not be.|s^bd
me010|i have no idea whether that's the best choice.|s^no
me010|and there're plenty of people around students in the department who you know live and breathe bayes-nets.|s
me010|so uh|fh
fe004|there's the tool kit that um kevin murphy has developed.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|it's okay.|s^ba
fe004|which might be useful too.|s^ba
me012|right.|b
me010|so yeah kevin would be a good person to start with.|s
fe004|and it's available matlab code.|s
me010|nancy knows him well.|s
me010|i don't know i don't know whether you guys have met kevin yet or not.|s^no
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|but uh|fh
me012|yeah i know him.|s^aa|s^na
mn015|but|%-
me010|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|but since we all probably are pretty sure that um the|s.%--
mn015|for example this the dialogue history is is um producing x. m. l documents.|s
mn015|m. three l. of course is x. m. l.|s
mn015|and the ontology that um uh the student is is constructing for me back in in e. m. l is in oil and that's also in x. m. l.|s.x
mn015|and so that's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries about hotels about castles and stuff is going to come from.|s.x
me010|uhhuh.|b
me010|yeah.|fg
mn015|um so if it has that i. o capability and if it's a java package it will definitely be able we can couple.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|so yeah we're sort of committed to x. m. l as the kind of uh interchange.|fg|s
me010|but that's you know not a big deal.|s
mn015|who isn't?|qh^df
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^f^g
me010|so in terms of of interchanging in and out of any module we build it'll be x. m. l.|s
me010|and if you're going off to queries to the ontology for example you'll have to deal with its interface.|s
me010|but that's that's fine.|s
me010|and um|fh
me010|all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind.|s
me010|so they they have worked very hard.|s
me010|it's kind of blackboards and multi wave blackboards.|s^e
me010|and ways of interchanging and registering your|s^e.%--
me010|and so forth.|s^e
me010|so|%--
me010|that i don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet.|s
me010|i mean if we can get the core of the thing to work in a way that we're comfortable with then we we can get in and out of it with uh x. m. l um little descriptors.|s
me010|i believe.|s^e
me010|i don't i don't see|s.%-
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|yeah yeah i like for example the what you said about the getting input from from just files about where you where you have the data have specified the features and so forth.|fg|s^rt
mn015|that's of course easy also to do with you know x. m. l.|s
me010|uh you could have an x.   yeah you could make and x. m. l format for that sure.|s^na|s^aa
mn015|so|%-
me010|that that|%--
me010|um|fh
me010|you know feature value x. m. l format is probably as good a way as any.|s
me010|so it's yeah i guess it's also worth um while you're poking around poke around for x. m. l packages that um do things you'd like.|s
me012|doesn't does smartkom system have such packages?|qy^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|sure.|s^aa
mn015|the the m. three l. library does that.|s^na
me010|and the question is you you you'll have to we'll have to|s.%--
mn015|it's also|s.%-
me010|that should be we should be able to look at that.|s^rt
mn015|no.|s^ar
mn015|the|%--
mn015|what i what sort of came to my mind is was the notion of an idea that if if there are nets that can actually try to set their own um probability factors based on on on on input|s.%--
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|which is in file format.|s
mn015|if we um get really wild on this we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made.|s
mn015|and for example if if they are in in mate then we get x. m. l documents with discourse annotations|s.%--
me012|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|you know from the discourse act down to the phonetic level.|s
mn015|um michael has a project where you know recognizing discourse acts.|s
mn015|and he does it all in mate.|s
mn015|and so they're actually annotating data and data and data.|s
mn015|so if we if we think it's worth it one of these days not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second and we have the possibility of of taking input that's generated elsewhere and learn from that that'd be nice.|s^cs
me012|right.|b
me010|it'd be nice but but i i i i don't want to count on it.|s^na|s^nd
me010|i mean you can't you can't run your project based on the speculation that that the data will come.|s^df
mn015|no no uh just for|s^ar|s.%-
me010|and you don't have to actually design the nets.|s^df^e
mn015|nuh|%--
mn015|just a back door that i i think we should devote|s^df.%-
me010|could happen.|s^am
me010|yeah so in terms of of the um the what the smartkom gives us for m. three l. packages it could be that they're fine or it could be eeh.|fg|s
me010|you don't you know you don't really like it.|s
me010|so we're not we're not we're not required to use their packages.|s
me010|we are required at the end to give them stuff in their format.|s.x
me010|but hey.|s
me012|right.|b
me010|um|fh
me010|it's uh|fh
me010|it doesn't control what you do you know internally.|s
me003|what's the time frame for this?|qw
mn015|two days?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|huh?|qw^br
mn015|two three days.|s^r^rt
me010|yeah i'd like that this yeah this week to to to have guys uh you know pick the you know belief net package.|s^aa|s
mn015|no.|s^ar.%
me010|and tell us what it is and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something.|s^e
me012|sure.|s^bk
me010|and then as soon as we have it i think we should start trying to populate it for this problem.|s
me010|make a first cut at you know what's going on.|s
me010|and probably the easiest way to do that is some online way.|s
me010|i mean you can figure out whether you want to make it a web site.|s
me010|or you know|s.%-
mn015|uh i i i um okay i|fg|%--
mn015|yeah.|fh
mn015|i was actually more joking with the two or three days.|s^df
me010|okay i wasn't.|s^bk|s
mn015|so this was was a usual|s.%-
mn015|um it will take as long as you guys need for that.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|but um maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who's going to be the speaker next monday to tell us something about the net you picked.|s^cs.x
mn015|and what it does and how it does that.|s^e
me010|well well or both of them speak.|s^aap^cs.x
me012|sure.|s^aa.%
me010|we don't care.|s^no
mn015|yeah or you can split it up.|s^aa|s^cs
mn015|so|%-
me012|huh.|b
mn015|so that will be sort of the assignment for next week is to to for slides and whatever net you picked.|s.x
mn015|and what it can do and and how far you've gotten.|s
me010|well i'd like to also though uh have a first cut at what the belief net looks like.|s^aap^cs
me010|even if it's really crude.|s^e
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|so you know here here are|s.%-
me003|so we're supposed to about features and whatnot.|s^bu
me003|and|fh
me010|right yeah.|s^aa
me012|uhhuh.|b
me010|and as i said what i'd like to do is|s.%--
me010|i mean what would be really great is you bring it in if if if we could uh in the meeting say you know here's the package.|s:s
me010|here's the current one we have.|s:s
me010|uh you know what other ideas do you have.|s:qw
me010|and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file.|s
me010|of|%--
me010|uh you know get a a tentative format for it.|s
me010|let's say x. m. l that says you know these are the various scenarios we've experienced.|s
me010|we can just add to that.|s.x
me010|and there'll be this this file of them.|s.x
me010|and when you think you've got a better belief net you just run it against this um this data file.|s
me012|so we'll be like hand uh doing all the probabilities.|s^bu
me012|okay.|s^bk.%
me010|oh yeah until we know more.|s^aa|s
me003|and what's the relation to this with changing the table so that the system works in english?|qw
mn015|okay.|fg
mn015|so this is while you were doing this i received two lovely emails.|s
mn015|the the full n. t and the full linux version are there.|s
mn015|i've downloaded them both.|s^rt
mn015|and i started to unpack the linux one.|s
mn015|uh the n. t one worked fine.|s
mn015|and i started pack the linux one.|s
mn015|it told me that i can't really unpack it.|s
mn015|because it contains a future date.|s^df
mn015|so this is the time difference between germany.|s
mn015|i had to wait until one o'clock this afternoon before i was able to unpack it.|s^rt
mn015|now um then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on swede and on this machine.|s^rt
mn015|and so that we have it.|s
mn015|and then um hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to ralph and tilman that it will send some more documentation along|s.%--
mn015|we i control|s.%--
mn015|maybe that's what i will do next monday.|s
mn015|is show the state and show the system and show that.|s^e
me010|yeah.|b.%
me010|yeah so the answer johno is that these are at the moment separate.|fg|s
me010|uh what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works we can both worry about converting it to english and worry about how it could extract the parameters we need for the belief net.|s
me003|i guess my question was more about time frame.|s
me003|so we're going to do belief nets this week.|s
me003|and then|%-
me010|oh yeah i don't know.|s^bk|s^no
me010|none of this is neither of these projects has got a real tight timeline.|s
me010|in the sense that over the next month there's a there's a deliverable.|s
me003|okay.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so uh it's in that sense it's opportunistic.|s
me010|if if you know if we don't get any information for these guys for several weeks then we aren't going to sit around you know wasting time trying to do the problem or guess what they|s.%--
me010|you know just pppt.|s
me010|go on and do other things.|s
me003|okay.|b
mn015|yeah but uh but the uh this point is really i think very very valid that ultimately we hope that that both will merge into a harmonious and um wonderful um state.|fg|s
mn015|where we can not only do the bare necessities i. e changing the table so it does exactly in english what it does in german but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say okay this is what it usually does.|s:s
mn015|and now we add this little thing to it.|s
mn015|you know.|s^f
mn015|whatever|s.%--
mn015|johno's and bhaskara's great belief net.|s
mn015|and we plug it in.|s
mn015|and then for these certain tasks|s.%--
mn015|and we know that navigational tasks are going to be a core domain of the new system.|s
mn015|it all all of a sudden it does much better.|s
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|because it can produce better answers.|s^df
mn015|tell the person as i showed you on this map.|s^rt
mn015|you know produce either you know a red line that goes to the vista point.|s
mn015|or a red line that goes to the tango point.|s
mn015|or red line that goes to the door.|s
mn015|which would be great.|s^rt
mn015|so not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately if you produce a system like this it takes the person where it wants to go.|s
mn015|rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building.|s
me012|huh.|b
mn015|which is what they do now.|s
mn015|and we even had to take out a bit.|s
mn015|nancy you missed that part.|s
mn015|we had to take out a bit of the road work.|s
mn015|so that it doesn't take you to the wall every time.|s
fe004|oh really?|qy^bh
mn015|so um|fh
mn015|so this was actually an actual problem that we encountered.|s
mn015|which nobody have has|s.%--
mn015|because car navigation systems don't really care.|s^df
mn015|you know they get you to the beginning of the street.|s
mn015|some now do the house number.|s
fe004|huh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|but even that is problematic.|s
mn015|if you go if you want to drive to the s. a. p in waldorf|s^rt.%--
mn015|i'm sure the same is true of microsoft.|s
mn015|it takes you to the the address.|s
mn015|whatever street number blah blah blah|s^rt.%--
mn015|you are miles away from the entrance.|s
me010|yep.|b
mn015|because the postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere.|s^df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|but the entrance where you actually want to go is somewhere completely different.|s
mn015|so unless you're a mail person you really don't want to go there.|s
fe004|right yeah.|b
me010|probably not then.|s
me010|because you probably can't drop the mail there anyway.|s^df
mn015|probably neither not even that.|s^na
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|clear?|qy^d^rt
me012|okay sounds good.|s^bk|s^ba
me003|the powder tower is made of red limestone.|s^tc
fe004|i was wondering.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|do you want to see a picture?|qy^rt
fe004|sure.|s^aa
me003|sure.|s^aa
mn015|have to reboot for that though.|s
fe004|um|%--
fe004|so you two who'll be working on this are are you will you be doing well i mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation?|qy^rt
fe004|can you use the sample data?|qy^e
fe004|is it like|qy.%-
me010|of course they use the sample data.|s^na
fe004|yeah i mean is there more than|s^bk|qy.%--
fe004|is there a lot of sample data that is beyond what you what you have there?|qy
mn015|there there's more than i showed.|s^na
mn015|but um um i think this is sort of um in part my job to look at that.|s^df
mn015|and and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
mn015|and to come up with some features that are not you know empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|but sort of on your intuition of you know aha.|s:s^fe
me012|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|this is maybe a sign for that.|s
mn015|and this is maybe a sign for this.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|uhhuh.|b
me012|so yeah later this week we should sort of get together and sort of start thinking about that hopefully.|fg|s^cs
mn015|talk features.|s^2
mn015|yep.|s^bk
me010|okay we can end the meeting.|fg|s^t^tc
me010|and call adam.|s
me010|and then we want to look at some filthy pictures of heidelberg.|s
me010|we can do that as well.|s
me010|uh is that okay?|qy^rt
mn015|well they had they used the ammunition they stored the ammunition in that tower.|s
me010|all right.|s^bk
mn015|and that's why when it was hit by uh a cannon ball it exploded.|s
me003|it exploded.|s^2
me010|oh.|b
me003|that's why they call it the powder tower.|s^df
mn015|ahh.|s^bk
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|i first thought it had something to do with the material.|s^df
me003|that it that's why i asked.|s^df
fe004|that's right okay.|s^bk
mn015|huh.|b.%
me003|hey you're not supposed to be drinking in here dude.|z
mn015|okay.|z
me003|do we have to read them that slowly?|z
me003|okay.|z
me003|sounded like a robot.|z
me003|um this is|z
me012|okay.|z
me003|when you read the numbers it kind of reminded me of beat poetry.|z
mn015|i tried to go for the e e cummings sort of feeling.|z
mn015|but|z
me003|three three six zero zero.|z
me003|four two zero zero.|z
me003|one seven.|z
me003|that's what i think of when i think of beat poetry.|z
me012|beat poetry.|z
me003|you ever seen so i married an axe murderer?|z
me012|uh parts of it.|z
mn015|uhhuh.|z
me003|there's a part there's parts when he's doing beat poetry.|z
me012|oh yeah?|z
me003|and he talks like that.|z
me003|that's why i|z
me003|that uh probably is why i think of it that way.|z
mn015|huh.|z
mn015|no i didn't see that movie.|z
mn015|who did who made that?|z
me003|mike meyers is the guy.|z
mn015|oh.|z
mn015|okay.|z
me003|it's his uh it's his cute romantic comedy.|z
me003|that's that's|z
me003|that's his cute romantic comedy yeah.|z
me003|the other thing that's real funny i'll spoil it for you.|z
me003|is when he's he works in a coffee shop.|z
me003|in san francisco.|z
me003|and uh he's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso.|z
me003|and he's like excuse me i ordered the large espresso.|z
mn015|uh we're having a|z
mn015|tiramisu tasting contest this weekend.|z
me003|wait.|z
me003|do are|z
me003|so you're trying to decide who's the best taster of tiramisu?|z
mn015|no.|z
mn015|um there was a a a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best.|z
mn015|and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them.|z
me003|uh|z
mn015|and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste do a blind taste and then vote.|z
me003|huh.|z
mn015|should be fun.|z
me003|seems like|z
me003|seems like you could put a magic special ingredient in so that everyone know which one was yours.|z
me003|then if you were to bribe them you could uh|z
mn015|uhhuh.|z
mn015|well i was thinking if um|z
mn015|you guys have plans for sunday?|z
mn015|we're we're not|z
mn015|it's probably going to be this sunday but um we're sort of working with the weather here.|z
mn015|because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what whoever brings whatever you know can throw it on there.|z
mn015|so only the tiramisu is free nothing else.|z
me003|well i'm going back to visit my parents this weekend.|z
me003|so i'll be out of town.|z
mn015|so you're going to the west bay then?|z
mn015|no.|z
mn015|south bay?|z
me003|no the south bay.|z
me003|yeah.|z
mn015|south bay.|z
me012|well i should be free.|z
me012|so|z
mn015|okay i'll let you know.|z
me012|okay.|z
me003|we are.|z
me003|is nancy uh going to show up?|z
me003|huh.|z
me003|wonder if these things ever emit a very like piercing screech right in your ear.|z
mn015|they are going to get more comfortable headsets.|z
mn015|they already ordered them.|z
mn015|okay.|fh
me012|uh|b
mn015|let's get started.|s^co^t
mn015|the uh|%--
mn015|should i go first with the uh um data?|qy
mn015|can i have the remote control?|qy
mn015|thank you.|s^ft
mn015|okay.|b
mn015|so on friday we had our wizard test data test and um these are some of the results.|fh|s
mn015|this was the introduction.|s^rt
mn015|i actually uh even though liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject i sort of felt that she knew too much.|s^rt
mn015|so i asked uh litonya just on the spur of the moment and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject.|s^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|so this is what she saw as part of as uh for introduction.|s^rt
mn015|this is what she had to read aloud.|s
mn015|uh that was really difficult for her.|s
mn015|and uh|%-
me012|because of all the names you mean?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|the names and um|s^na^rt.%--
mn015|this was the uh first three tasks she had to to master after she called the system.|s^rt
mn015|and um then of course the system broke down.|fh|s
mn015|and those were the uh uh|s.%--
mn015|i should say the system was supposed to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve with a human.|s^rt
mn015|um|fh
mn015|there are here are uh the results.|s
mn015|huh.|fh
mn015|and i will not|s.%--
mn015|we will skip the reading now.|s^t
mn015|um|fh
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|the reading was five minutes exactly.|s^rt
mn015|and now comes the|s.%--
mn015|this is the phone in phase of|s.%--
me012|wait can i i have a question.|fg|s
me012|so so there's no system.|fh|s
me012|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me012|like there was a wizard for both uh both parts.|fh|s
me012|is this right?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|it was it both times the same person.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn015|one time pretending to be a system.|s
mn015|one time to pretending to be a human which is actually not pretending.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|and she didn't|s.%--
mn015|i should|%--
me012|i mean|s.%--
me012|well isn't this kind of obvious when it says okay now you're talking to a human and then the human has the same voice?|fh|qy^rt
mn015|no no no.|s^ar
mn015|we wait.|s^co
mn015|okay good question but uh|s^ba.%--
mn015|you you just wait and see.|s^co
mn015|it's you're going to learn.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and um the wizard sometimes will not be audible.|fh|s^rt
mn015|because she was actually they there was some uh lapse in the um wireless.|s^df
mn015|we have to move her closer.|s
me003|is she mispronouncing anlage?|qy^rt
me003|is it anlaga or anlunga?|qy
mn015|they're mispronouncing everything.|s
mn015|but it's|%--
me003|okay.|s^bk
mn015|this is the system breaking down actually.|s
mn015|did i call europe?|qy^rt
mn015|so this is it.|fh|s
mn015|well if we we um|s.%--
me010|so are are you trying to record this meeting?|qy^rt
mn015|there was a strange reflex.|s^rt
mn015|i have a headache.|s
mn015|i'm really sort of out of it.|s
mn015|okay the uh lessons learned.|s^t^tc
mn015|the reading needs to be shorter.|s^cs
mn015|five minutes is just too long.|s
mn015|um that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here they're going to not they're subjects are probably not going to going to follow the order.|fh|s
mn015|and uh she did not.|s
mn015|she|%-
me012|really?|qh
mn015|no.|s^ar
mn015|she she jumped around quite a bit.|s^rt
me012|oh it's surprising.|s
me010|so if you just number them one two three it's|s^bu.%--
mn015|yeah and make it sort of clear in the uh|s^aa|s.%--
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|right.|s^bk
mn015|um we need to so that's one thing.|fh|s^rt
mn015|and we need a better introduction for the wizard.|fh|s^cs^rt
mn015|that is something that fey actually thought of a in the last second that the system should introduce itself when it's called.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me010|true.|s^aa
mn015|and um um another suggestion by liz was that we uh through subjects switch the tasks.|fg|s^cs
mn015|so when when they have task one with the computer the next person should have task one with a human and so forth.|s^e^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|so we get nice um data for that.|s^rt
mn015|um we have to refine the tasks more and more which of course we haven't done at all so far in order to avoid this rephrasing.|fh|s^cs
mn015|so where even though we don't tell the person ask blah blah blah blah blah.|s
mn015|they still try or at least litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible.|s
me012|say exactly what's on there?|qy^2^rt
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|and uh my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard because i think she did a wonderful job.|s^cs^rt
me010|great.|b
mn015|in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for.|s^rt
mn015|how much is a a bus ticket and a transfer?|qw
mn015|so this is going to happen all the time we you can never be sure.|fh|s^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|um johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard.|fh|s^rt
mn015|so um|fh
me003|yes.|s^aa
me003|i wasn't wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for uh not a man.|s
mn015|but uh|fg
me012|there's no female equivalent of|s.%--
me003|are you sure?|qy^bu^rt
me012|no i don't know.|s^no
me012|not that i know of.|s^no
me010|right.|b
mn015|well there is witch and warlock.|s
mn015|and uh|fh
me012|yeah that's what i was thinking but|s^aa|s.%--
me003|yeah that's so|s.%-
me010|right.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|okay.|fg
me010|uh|fg
mn015|and um|fg
mn015|so some some work needs to be done but i think we can uh|fh|s.%--
mn015|and this and in case no you hadn't seen it this is what litonya looked at during the uh um while taking the while partaking in the data collection.|s
me012|uh.|b
me010|okay.|fg
me010|great.|fg
me010|so first of all i agree that um we should hire fey and start paying her.|fh|s^t
me010|probably pay for the time she's put in as well.|s
me010|um do you know exactly how to do that?|fh|qy
me010|or is uh lila|qrr.%--
me010|i mean you know what exactly do we do to to put her on the payroll in some way?|qw
mn015|i'm completely clueless but i'm willing to learn.|s^ng
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|well you'll have to|s^co.%--
me010|right.|fh
me010|so anyway|fh
me010|um|fh
me010|so why don't you uh ask lila?|qh^co
me010|and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in|s.%-
mn015|student type worker.|s^2
mn015|or|fh
me010|well yeah she's she's not a a student.|s^ng
me010|she just graduated.|s
me010|but anyway|fh
mn015|huh.|b
me010|so if|%--
me010|yeah i agree.|s^tc
me010|she sounded fine.|s
me010|she actually was uh more uh present and stuff than than she was in conversation.|s
me010|so she did a better job than i would have guessed from just talking to her.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|so i think that's great.|s^ba
mn015|this is sort of what i gave her so this is for example how to get to the student prison.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|and i didn't even spell it out here.|s
mn015|and in some cases i i spelled it out a little bit um more thoroughly.|s^rt
me010|right.|b
mn015|this is the information on on the low sunken castle and the amphitheater that never came up.|s
mn015|and um so if we give her even more um instruments to work with i think the results are going to be even better.|fh|s^cs
me010|oh yeah.|s^aa
me010|and then of course as she does it she'll she'll learn.|s
me010|so that's great.|s^ba
me010|um and also if she's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful.|fh|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|and uh she's actually she's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm.|fh|s
me010|so i think this is all just fine in terms of her learning things she's going to need to know uh to do her career.|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|so i my guess is she'll be quite happy to take on that job.|s
me010|and so|fh
mn015|yep.|b
mn015|yeah she she didn't explicitly state that.|s
mn015|so|fh
me010|great.|s^ba
mn015|and um i told her that we going to um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and look for the potential sources to find people.|fh|s
mn015|she also agrees that you know if it's all just going to be students the data is going to be less valuable because of that.|s
mn015|so|fh
me010|well as i say there is this set of people next door it's not hard to|s.%-
mn015|we're already|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|uh|fg
mn015|however we may run into a problem with a reading task there.|s^ng
mn015|and um we'll see.|fh|s
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|we could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there's a task pays ten bucks or something.|s^cs^rt
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff.|fh|s^e
me010|and and there'll probably be self selection to some extent.|fh|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|yep.|b
me010|uh so that's good.|fh|s^ba^tc
me010|um now i signed us up for the wednesday slot and part of what we should do is this.|fh|s^cs^t
mn015|okay.|b^rt
me010|so|fh
me010|my idea on that was uh partly we'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists.|s
me010|but partly i did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all um you know what the dialogue is and what's going on linguistically.|s
me010|because to the extent that we can get them contributing.|s
me010|that will be good.|s^ba
mn015|yep.|b
me010|so this issue about you know re formulating things.|s
me010|maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they'll help us with it.|s^cs
me010|uh other linguists if you're a linguist.|fh|s^bc
me010|but in any case.|s
mn015|yep.|b
me010|um the linguistics students and stuff.|fh|s
me010|so my idea on on wednesday is partly to uh|s^t.%--
me010|you i mean what you did today would is just fine.|s
me010|you just uh do this is what we did and here's the thing and here's some of the dialogue and and so forth.|s
me010|but then the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of of what's going on with the system design.|s^co
me010|and where we think the belief nets fit in.|fh|s
me010|and where the pieces are and stuff like that.|s
mn015|yep.|b
me010|is is this make sense to everybody?|qy^rt
me010|yeah.|fh.%
me010|so i don't i don't think it's worth a lot of work particularly on your part to to to make a big presentation.|s^rt
me010|i don't think you should|s.%--
me010|you don't have to make any new uh powerpoint or anything.|s
me010|i think we got plenty of stuff to talk about.|s
me010|and then um just see how a discussion goes.|fh|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|sounds good.|s^ba
mn015|the uh other two things is um|s^t.%--
mn015|we've can have johno tell us a little about this.|s^cs^rt^t
me010|great.|s^ba
mn015|and we also have a little bit on the interface.|s^rt^t
mn015|m three l enhancement.|s^e^rt^t
mn015|and then um that was it i think.|fh|s
me003|so what i did for this this is uh a pedagogical belief net.|s
me003|because i was i i took i tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out.|s^df
me003|so what i did was i took|s.%--
me003|i made these dummy nodes called trajector-in and trajector-out that would isolate the things related to the trajector.|s
me010|yep.|b
me003|and then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal.|s
me010|yep.|b
me003|and i separated them out.|s
me003|and then i um did similar things for our our net to uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot.|s
me003|um so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer.|fh|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and then the bottom layer is just the mode.|s
me003|so|fh
me010|so let's let's|s^co.%--
me010|yeah i don't understand it.|s^no
me010|let's go|s^co.%--
me010|slide all the way up so we see what the the very bottom looks like.|s^co
me010|or is that it?|qy^rt
me003|yeah there's just one more node and it says mode which is the decision between the|s^aa|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|okay great.|s^bk
me010|all right.|s^bk
me010|so|fh
me003|so basically all i did was i took the last belief net.|s^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and i grouped things according to what how i thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related.|s
me003|and the two that i came up with were trajector-landmark and then source path goal as initial ones.|s
me010|yep.|b
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and then i said well uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|yep.|s^aa
me003|um you know we have we have the concept of what their intention was whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever.|h|s
me010|right.|b
me003|or they were hurried.|s
me003|that's kind of related to that.|s
me003|and then um in terms of the source the things uh the only things that we had on there i believe were whether|fh|s.%--
me003|oh actually i kind of i might have added these because i don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one.|s^bc
me003|but uh whether the where i'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether|fh|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|or the landmark-iness of where i'm currently at.|s^bc
me003|and usefulness is basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that's not something that you'd visit for tourist's tourism's sake or whatever.|s
me003|travel constraints would be something like you know maybe they said they can they only want to take a bus or something like that.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me003|and then those are somewhat related to the path.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|so that would determine whether we'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly.|s^e
me003|um goal.|fh|s
me003|similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed.|s
me003|and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination.|s
me003|um and then if you go up|fh|s.%--
me003|robert.|s
me003|yeah so um in terms of context what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person.|fh|s
me003|um discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours.|fh|s
me003|or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee or something along those lines.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|uh prosody i don't really i'm not really sure what prosody means in this context.|fh|s^rt
me003|so i just made up you know whether whether what they say is or how they say it is is that.|s
me010|right okay.|s^bk
me003|um the parse would be what verb they chose.|fh|s
me003|and then maybe how they modified it in the sense of whether they said i need to get there quickly or whatever.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|and um in terms of world knowledge this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things the time of day it is and whatnot.|fh|s
mn015|what's tourbook?|qw
me003|tourbook|s^m.%--
me003|that would be i don't know the landmark-iness of things.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
me003|whether it's in the tourbook or not.|s^e
me010|ch-ch-ch-ch|h
me010|now.|s^tc
me010|all right so i understand what's what you got.|s
me010|i don't yet understand how you would use it.|s^no
me010|so let me see if i can ask.|s
me010|a|%-
me003|well this is not a working bayes-net.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|no i understand that.|s^arp
me010|but but um|fh
me010|so what|qw.%--
me010|let's slide back up again.|s^co
me010|and see|%--
me010|start at the at the bottom.|s
me010|and|%--
me010|oop-bo-doop-boop-boop.|b
me010|yeah.|b
me010|so you could imagine|fg|s^cs.%--
me010|uh go ahead you were about to go up there and point to something.|fh|s^co
me003|well i okay i just|s^nd.%--
me003|say what you were going to say.|s^co
me010|good do it.|s^co
me010|no no.|s^co
me003|okay.|s^aa
me010|go do it.|s^co^r
me003|uh i i'd no i was going to wait until|s^nd.%-
me010|oh okay.|s^bk
me010|so so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh bayes-net.|fg|s
me010|that is you know with fill|s^e.%--
me010|you know actually uh fill it in then uh|s.%--
me003|so we'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the mode.|s^bu
me010|well i don't|s^ng.%--
me010|that's an issue.|s
me010|so um|fh
me003|because i don't understand how it would work otherwise.|s^df
me010|well here's the problem.|s
me010|and and uh bhaskara and i was talking about this a little earlier today.|s
me010|is if we just do this we could wind up with a huge uh combinatoric input to the mode thing.|s^cs
me010|and uh|fh
me003|well i oh yeah i i understand that.|s^na
me003|i just uh it's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that.|s
me010|well but that's what we have to do.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay so so|fg
me010|uh|fh
me010|there there are a variety of ways of doing it.|s
me010|uh let me just mention something that i don't want to pursue today.|fh|s^co^t
me010|which is there are technical ways of doing it.|s^e
me010|uh i slipped a paper to bhaskara and about noisy-or's and noisy-maxes.|s
me010|and|fh
me010|there're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your bayes-net-edness.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|uh so if you you could and|fh|s.%--
me010|now i don't know that any of those actually apply in this case.|s^no
me010|but there is some technology you could try to apply.|s
me003|so it's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that|s^bu.%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|b
me010|and um|fh
me010|so|fh
me003|so in that case the we'd have we|s^bu.%--
me003|i mean these wouldn't be the summary nodes.|s
me003|we'd have the summary nodes like|s.%--
me003|where the things were i guess maybe if if things were related to business or some other|s.%-
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|so what i was going to say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally|s^cs.%--
me003|yeah.|b
me010|i mean not necessarily in in this meeting but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are.|s^cs^e
me010|so if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode.|fh|s
me010|you know what are the most relevant things.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|and the other trick which is not a technical trick it's kind of a knowledge engineering trick is to make the each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics.|s
me010|so that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a tradeoff between three factors whatever they may be.|fh|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me010|then you could say aha let's have these three factors.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me010|and maybe a binary version for each or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one.|s^cs
me003|huh.|b
me010|and then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about.|s
me010|so that so that you know you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing.|s^cs
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|given that we're not going to screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox bayes nets then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|and|fh
me003|so what i kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|uh uh uh|%
me010|yeah.|b
me003|so that|%-
me010|well huh something.|h|s^aap
me010|i mean so uh robert has thought about this problem for a long time because he's had these examples kicking around.|fh|s
me010|so he may have some good intuition about you know what are the crucial things.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|and um i understand where this the uh|fh|s.%--
me010|this is a way of playing with this source path goal trajector uh uh abstraction and and sort of displaying it in a particular way.|s
me003|yeah.|b
me010|uh i don't think our friends uh on wednesday are going to be able to|h|s.%--
me010|well maybe they will.|s^bc
me010|well let me think about whether whether i think we can present this to them or not.|s^co
me010|um|fh
me010|uh|fh
mn015|well i think this is still i mean ad hoc.|s
mn015|this is sort of the second version and i i i look at this maybe just as a you know a a whatever u m l diagram or you know as just a uh screen shot not really as a bayes net as john johno said.|s
me003|we could actually yeah draw it in a different way in the sense that it would make it more abstract.|s^cs
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|but the uh the the nice thing is that you know it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has clearly have to be specified more carefully.|s
mn015|and uh|%-
me010|all right well let me think about this some more.|fg|s^co
me010|and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them.|fh|s
mn015|i mean ultimately we we may|fg|s.%--
mn015|we regard this as sort of an exercise in in thinking about the problem.|s
mn015|and maybe a first version of uh a module if you want to call it that that you can ask|s.%--
mn015|that you can give input.|s
mn015|and it'll uh throw the dice for you.|s
mn015|uh throw the die for you.|s^bc
mn015|because um i integrated this into the existing smartkom system in in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh this thing.|s^df
mn015|close this down.|s^t1
mn015|so if this is what m three l um will look like and what it'll give us.|s
mn015|um|fh
mn015|and a very simple thing.|s
mn015|we have an action that he wants to go from somewhere which is some type of object to someplace.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|and this these uh this changed now only um um|s.%--
mn015|it's doing it twice now because it already did it once.|s
mn015|um we'll add some action type which in this case is approach and could be you know more refined uh in many ways.|fh|s^cc
me010|uhhuh.|b^rt
me010|good.|b
mn015|or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place.|s
mn015|and it will give us then of course an action type of the type enter.|s
mn015|so this is just based on this one um on this one feature.|s^bs
mn015|and that's that's about all you can do.|s
mn015|and so in the|s.%--
mn015|if this if the object type um here is is a is a landmark of course it'll be um vista.|s
mn015|and um this is about as much as we can do if we don't if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify okay if it's this and this but that is not the case and so forth it just gets really really messy.|fh|s
me010|okay i'm sorry.|fg
me010|you're you're|%--
mn015|huh?|qw
me010|it was much too quick for me.|s
me010|okay so let me see if i understand what you're saying.|s^co
me010|so i i do understand that uh you can take the m three l and add not and it|fh|s^bs.%--
me010|and you need to do this for sure.|s^co
me010|we have to add you know not too much about um object types and stuff.|s^cc
me010|and what i think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say if it's of type landmark then you take you're going to take a picture of it.|s^bu
mn015|exactly.|s^aa
me010|full stop.|s
me010|i mean that's what you do.|s
me010|every landmark you take a picture of.|s
mn015|every public place you enter and statue you want to go as near as possible.|s
me010|you enter.|s
me010|you approach.|s^2
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|uh and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing smartkom system.|fh|s
me010|and you just did.|s
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and it it would do us no good.|s
mn015|that.|s
me010|uh|h
mn015|ultimately.|s
me010|well so well and let's think about this.|fg|s^co
me010|um that's a that's another kind of baseline case.|fh|s
me010|that's another sort of thing okay here's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this.|s
me010|add extra properties|s.%--
me010|a deterministic rule for every property.|s
me010|you have an action pppt.|s
me010|you do that.|s
me010|um then the question would be|fh|s.%--
me010|uh now if that's all you're doing then you can get the types from the ontology.|fh|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me010|because that's all you're all you're using is this type the types in the ontology and you're done.|s^df
mn015|huh?|qw^rt
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|so we don't we don't use the discourse we don't use the context we don't do any of those things.|s
mn015|no.|s^aa
me010|all right but that's but that's okay and i mean it's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things.|s
me010|and that's something the uh smartkom people themselves would|s.%--
me010|they'd say sure that's no problem.|s
me010|you know no problem to add types to the|s.%--
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|no.|s^ar
mn015|and|%--
mn015|this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very very easily is um|s.%--
mn015|we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw and we have our content.|s
mn015|now the content|s.%--
me010|huh.|b
mn015|i which is sort of what what we see here which is sort of the vista schema source path goal whatever.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|this will um be um a job to find ways of writing down image schema x schema constructions in some some form.|s
mn015|and have this be in a in a in the content.|s
mn015|loosely called constructicon.|s
mn015|and the rules we want to throw away completely.|s
mn015|and um and here is exactly where what's going to be replaced with our bayes net.|fh|s
mn015|which is exactly getting the input feeding into here.|s
mn015|this decides whether it's whether action|s.%--
mn015|the the enter.|s
mn015|the vista.|s
mn015|or the whatever.|s
me010|uh approach you called it i think this time.|s^bsc
mn015|uh approach um construction should be activated i e just pasted in.|s
me010|that's what you said.|s
me010|yeah that's fine.|s^ba
me010|yeah but|fg
me010|right.|fg
me010|but it's not construction there it's action.|s^nd
me010|construction is a is a different story.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me003|right.|b
me003|this is uh|s.%--
me003|so what we'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the for the x schema?|qy^d^rt
me010|for for for|s^2.%-
me010|yes.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|b
me010|so that that uh|s.%--
me010|if you had the generalized go x schema.|s
me010|and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones then you would have to supply the parameters.|s
me003|right.|b
me010|and then uh although we haven't worried about this yet you might want to worry about something that would go to the g i s.|s^cs
me010|and use that to actually get you know detailed route planning.|s^cs
me010|so you know where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that.|fh|s^e
me003|uhhuh.|b
me010|but that's not it's not the immediate problem.|s
me003|right.|b
me010|but presumably that that that functionality's there when when we|fh|s.%--
me003|so the immediate problem is just deciding which|s^bu.%-
mn015|aspects of the x schema to add.|s^2
me010|yeah so the the immediate problem is is back to what you were what you are doing with the belief net.|fg|s
me003|yeah.|b
me010|you know uh what are we going to use to make this decision?|fh|qh
me003|right and then once we've made the decision how do we put that into the content?|qh
me010|yeah.|b
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|well that that actually is relatively easy in this case.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|the harder problem is we decide what we want to use how are we going to get it.|s
me010|and that the the that's the hardest problem.|s
me010|so the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology.|s
me010|the|%--
me010|so i think that's the hardest problem at the moment is is|s.%--
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|where are you going to|s.%--
me010|how are you going to get this information.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|and that's so getting back to here.|s^t^tc
me010|uh we have a a technical problem with the belief nets that we we don't want all the|fh|s.%--
me003|there's just too many factors right now.|s^2
me010|too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially.|s^m
me003|right.|b
me010|so we want to think about which ones we really care about.|s
me010|and what they really most depend on.|s
me010|and can we you know clean this this up to the point where it|s.%-
me003|so what we really want to do|s^bu.%--
me003|because this is really just the three layer net we want to make it expand it out into more layers basically?|qy^bu^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|we might.|s^am
me010|uh i mean that that's certainly one thing we can do.|fh|s
me010|uh it's true that the way you have this a lot of the times you have|fh|s.%--
me010|what you're having is the values rather than the variable.|s
me010|so uh|fh
me003|right.|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
me003|so instead of instead it should really be just be intention as a node instead of intention business or intention tour.|s^bu
me010|so you|%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|fg
me010|and then it would have values uh tour business or uh hurried.|s^e
me003|right.|s^aa
me010|but then but it still some knowledge design to do about how do you want to break this up what really matters.|s
me003|right.|b
me010|i mean it's fine.|s^ba
me010|you know we have to it's it's iterative.|s
me010|we're going to have to work with it some.|s^cc
me003|i think what was going through my mind when i did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention.|s
me003|and|fh
me003|the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time|s.%-
me010|well you you could do that.|s
me010|and it's perfectly okay to uh insist that that you know um they add up to one.|s
me010|but that there's uh that that it doesn't have to be one zero zero.|s^e
me003|huh.|s^bk
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me010|so you could have the conditional|s^cs.%--
me010|so|fh
me010|the each of these things is going to be a a a probability.|s
me010|so whenever there's a choice|s.%--
me010|uh|fh
me010|so like landmark ness and usefulness.|s
me003|well see i don't think those would be mutually|s^nd.%--
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me003|it seems like something could both be|s.%-
me010|absolutely right.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|and so that you might want to then have those|s^cs.%--
me010|then they may have to be separate.|s
me010|they may not be able to be values of the same variable.|s
mn015|object type.|s^2
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that's|%--
me010|but again this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|it's you know it's great is is you know as one step toward uh toward where we want to go.|s
mn015|also it strikes me that we we may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a uh a specification for some interface here that um takes the normal m three l looks at it.|s^cs
mn015|then we discussed in our pre edu e d u meeting um how to ask the ontology what to ask the ontology.|s
mn015|um the fact that we can pretend we have one make a dummy until we get the real one.|fh|s
mn015|and so um we we may want to decide we can do this from here.|fh|s^cs
mn015|but we also could do it um you know if we have a a a belief net interface.|s^e
mn015|so the belief net takes as input a vector.|s
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|of stuff.|s^e
mn015|and it|s.%-
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|and um it output is whatever as well.|s^rt
mn015|but this information is just m three l.|fh|s^rt
mn015|and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology.|s
mn015|and we want to look up some more stuff in the|s.%--
mn015|maybe we want to ask the real world.|s^cs
mn015|maybe you want to look something up in the g r s.|s^cs^rt
mn015|but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some some stuff.|s
mn015|based on|%--
mn015|we we have uh|s.%--
mn015|i was just made some examples from the ontology.|s
mn015|and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a a a building and it has doors and stuff like this.|s
mn015|but it is also an institution so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth.|s
mn015|and we get relations out of it and once we have them we can use that information to look in the dialogue history.|s
mn015|were any of these things that that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned?|qy^rt
me010|uhhuh.|b
mn015|were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned?|qy^rt
me012|right.|b
mn015|and so forth.|s
mn015|and maybe draw some inferences on that.|s^cs
mn015|so this may be a a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector that we feed into the belief net.|s^rt
mn015|and then|%-
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|i think that's i think that's exactly right.|s
me010|there will be rules but they aren't rules that come to final decisions they're rules that gather information for a decision process.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|no i think that's that's just fine.|s^ba
me010|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
me010|so they'll they presumably there'll be a thread or process or something that|s.%-
me010|agent yeah agent whatever you want to say yeah.|s^m^na
me010|that uh is rule driven and can can uh can do things like that.|s^e
me010|and um there's an issue about whether there will be that'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision.|fh|s
me010|so it probably will.|s
me010|my guess is it'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information run it through a a this belief net that|s.%-
me010|turn a crank in the belief net.|s^m
me010|that'll come out with uh more another vector.|s
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end.|s
me010|so you now know what you're going to do.|s
me010|and that may actually involve getting more information.|fh|s
me010|so once you pull that out it could be that that says uh.|s:s^fe
me010|now that we know that we going to go ask the ontology something else.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me010|now that we know that it's a bus trip.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^g
me010|we didn't we didn't need to know beforehand uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever but but now that we know that's the way it's coming out then we got to go find out more.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|so i think that's okay.|s^ba
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so this is actually if if we were to build something that is um|s.%--
mn015|and uh i had one more thing.|h|s
mn015|the it needs to do|s.%--
mn015|yeah|fh
mn015|i think we i i can come up with a a code for a module that we call the cognitive dispatcher which does nothing.|s^cc
me010|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn015|but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out.|s
mn015|there's this is maybe something that this module can do something that this module can do.|s
mn015|and then collect uh sub objects and then recombine them and put them together.|s
mn015|so maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it and uh get this part.|s^cs
me010|oh okay.|s^bk
me010|uh|fg
mn015|then|%--
mn015|yeah.|s
me010|i confess i'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story.|s
me010|um|h
me010|this this is not a complaint this is a promise to do more work.|s^cc
me010|so i'm going to have to think about it some more.|s
me010|um in particular|fh|s.%--
me010|see what we'd like to do and and this has been implicit in the discussion is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of reuse.|s
me010|so what you're trying to get out of this deep cognitive linguistics is the fact that if you know about source source paths and goals and nnn all this sort of stuff that a lot of this is the same for different tasks.|fh|s
me010|and that uh there's there's some some important generalities that you're getting.|s
me010|so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and have to redo it.|s
me010|and i don't yet see how that goes.|s
me010|all right.|s.%
mn015|there're no primitives upon which uh|s.%-
me010|what are the primitives and how do you break this|qw.%--
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|so i i'm just just there saying eee well you i know how to do any individual case.|s
me010|right?|qy^d^g
me010|but i don't yet|s.%--
me010|see what's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to get powerful generalizations.|s
me010|and|fh
mn015|yep.|b
me010|um|fh
mn015|maybe we|s^cs.%--
mn015|should we add then the what's this domain?|qy:qw^rt
mn015|i mean we have to.|s
mn015|how do i get to x.|s:qw
mn015|then we also have the what's this domain where we get some slightly different|s.%--:qw.%--
me012|right.|b
me010|could uh|qy.%-
mn015|um johno actually does not allow us to call them intentions anymore.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|so he he dislikes the term.|s
me010|well i i don't like the term either so i have|s.%--
me010|uh|fg
me010|it uh|%--
mn015|but um i'm sure the what's this questions also create some interesting x schema aspects.|fg|s
me010|could be.|s^am
mn015|so|fh
me010|i'm not a i'm not particularly opposed to adding that or any other task.|s
me010|i mean eventually we're going to want a whole range of them.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
me012|that's right.|s^aa
me010|uh|h
me010|i'm just saying that i'm going to have to do some sort of first principles thinking about this.|s^cc
me010|i just at the moment don't know.|s^no
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|no.|s^ar
me010|well no the bayes the bayes nets|s^ar|s.%-
me010|the bayes nets will be specific for each decision.|s^m
me010|but what i'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties that will go into different bayes nets be the uh general.|s
me010|so that if you have sources you have trajectors and stuff like that.|s
me010|and there's a language for talking about trajectors.|s^e
me010|you shouldn't have to do that differently.|s
me010|for uh uh going to something than for circling it.|s
me010|for uh telling someone else how to go there.|s
mn015|getting out of|s^2.%-
me010|whatever it is.|s
me010|so that that the the decision processes are going to be different.|s
me010|what you'd really like of course is the same thing you'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs.|s
me010|so all sorts of different tasks and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on.|fh|s
me010|and that's that would be the really pretty result.|fh|s
me010|and pushing it one step further when you get to construction grammar and stuff what you'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh smartkom.|fh|s
me010|that that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there's uh something about the intent.|s
me010|you know the actual what people want to do or what they're referring to and stuff.|s
me010|independent of whether it about what is this or where is it or something that you could tell from the construction you could pull out deep semantic information which you're going to use in a general way.|s
me010|so that's the|s.%-
me010|you might.|s^am
me010|you might.|s^am^r
me010|you might be able to to uh|s.%--
me010|say that this this is the kind of construction in which the|s.%--
me010|there's let's say there's a uh|s.%--
me010|there the the the construction implies the there's a this thing is being viewed as a container.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|so just from this local construction you know that you're going to have to treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information.|s
me010|and that may effect the way you process everything else.|s
me010|so if you say how do i get into the castle.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|then um|%--
me010|or you know what is there in the castle or|s.%--
me010|so there's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container.|s
me010|and you'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle's referred to as a container you crank up the appropriate stuff.|s
me010|independent of what the goal is and independent of what the surrounding language is.|s^e
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|all right so that's that's the that's the thesis level.|s^tc
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh|fh
mn015|it's unfortunate also that english has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs.|s
mn015|because they're really fancy then in in for these kinds of analysis.|s^df
mn015|but uh|fh
me010|well you have prepositional phrases that|s^ng.%-
mn015|yeah but they're they're easier for parsers.|s^aap
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|parsers can pick those up but but the with the spatial adverbs they have a tough time.|s
mn015|because the the semantics are very complex in that.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|okay yeah.|b
mn015|i had one more thing.|s^t1
mn015|i don't remember.|s^no
mn015|i just forgot it again.|s
mn015|no.|h
mn015|oh yeah!|s^fe
mn015|but an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else or whatever.|s
mn015|so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we're we're we're talking about that are independent of the problem.|s
mn015|that generalize over those problems and are oh of a higher quality than any actual whatever um belief net or x that we may use for the decision making ultimately.|s
mn015|should be decoupled yeah.|s
mn015|okay.|b
me010|right.|b
me010|so are we going to be meeting here from now on?|fg|qy^rt
me010|i'm i'm happy to do that.|s
me010|we we had talked about it because you have the display and everything that seems fine.|s
mn015|yeah um liz also asks whether we're going to have presentations every time.|s
mn015|i don't think we will need to do that but it's|s.%-
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|so far i think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and and|s.%-
me010|oh yeah!|s^fe
me010|no i i think it's worth it to to meet here to bring this and assume that something may come up that we want to look at.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|i mean why not.|s
mn015|and um|h
mn015|yeah that was my|fh|s.%-
me010|she was good.|s^ba
me010|litonya was good.|s^ba^rt
mn015|yeah?|qh
mn015|the uh um she she was definitely good in the sense that she she showed us some of the weaknesses.|fh|s^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|and um also the um the fact that she was a real subject you know is is|fh|s.%-
me010|right.|fg
me010|yeah and and and yeah and and she took it seriously and stuff.|fh|s
me010|no it was great.|s^ba
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|so i think that um i mean|s.%--
mn015|looking just looking at this data listening to it what can we get out of it in terms of our problem.|s
mn015|for example is you know she actually said you know she never just spoke about entering she just wanted to get someplace and she said for buying stuff.|s
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|so this is definitely interesting and|s.%--
me012|yeah right.|s^aa
mn015|um and in the other case where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti.|fh|s^rt
mn015|also of course not in the sentence how do you get there was pretty standard.|s
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|except that there was a nice anaphora you know for pointing at what she talked about before.|s
mn015|and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls.|s
mn015|so|fh
me012|right.|b
mn015|actually you'd need a lot of world knowledge.|s
mn015|this would have been a classical um uh tango actually.|s
mn015|um because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside.|fh|s^df
me012|yeah.|b
mn015|but|fh
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so the mistake would have make a mistake the system would have made a mistake here.|s
me012|yep.|b
me010|click.|s
me010|all right.|b
me003|yeah i think i got my mike on.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk^rt
me003|let's see.|s
me010|okay ami do yours.|s^bk|s^co
me010|then we'll open it.|s
me010|and i think it'll be enough.|s
me003|huh doesn't uh it should be the other way.|s
me003|yeah now it's on.|s
mn036|right okay.|s^bk^rt
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so we all switched on?|qy^rt
me003|we are all switched on yeah.|s^na|s^aa
me010|all right.|s^bk
mn036|we are all switched on.|s^m^na
me010|anyway so uh before we get started with the uh technical part i just want to review what i think is happening with the our data collection.|fg|s^t
me010|so uh probably after today that shouldn't come up in this meeting.|fh|s
me010|this this is should be it isn't there's another thing going on of gathering data.|s
me010|and that's pretty much independent of this.|s
me010|but uh i just want to make sure we're all together on this.|s
me010|what we think is going to happen is that uh in parallel starting about now we're going to get fey to where you're working with me and robert draft a note that we're going to send out to various cogsci and other classes saying here's an opportunity to be a subject.|s:s
me010|contact fey.|s^e:s
me010|and then there'll be a certain number of um hours during the week which she will be available.|s
me010|and we'll bring in people.|s
me010|uh roughly how many robert?|qw
me010|we do we know?|qy^e
mn015|um fifty was our sort of our first|s.%-
me010|okay so we're looking for a total of fifty people.|s^bk|s
me010|not necessarily by any means all students.|s
me010|but we'll we'll start with with that.|s
me010|in parallel with that we're going to need to actually do the script.|s
me010|and so i guess there's a plan to have a meeting friday afternoon uh with uh jane and maybe liz and whoever on actually getting the script worked out.|s
me010|but what i'd like to do if it's okay is to to as i say start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week.|s
me010|the week after that's spring break.|s^df
me010|and maybe we'll look for them some subjects next door.|s^cs
mn015|yeah.|b.%
me010|or|%-
mn015|yeah also fey will not be here during spring break.|fg|s
me010|oh okay then we won't do it.|s^bk|s^cs
mn015|so|fh
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so that's easy.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|so is is that make sense to everybody?|qy^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|also um both fey and i will um do something of which i may uh kindly ask you to to do the same thing.|s
mn015|which is we going to check out our social infrastructures for possible subjects.|s
mn015|meaning um kid children's gymnastic classes.|s
mn015|preschool parents and so forth.|s^e
mn015|they also sometimes have flexible schedules.|s
mn015|so if you happen to be sort of in a non student social setting|s.%--
mn015|and you know people who may be interested in being subjects|s.%--
mn015|we also considered using the berkeley high school and their teachers maybe.|s
mn015|and get them interested in stuff.|s
me010|that's a good idea.|s^ba
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|so that's as far as our brainstorming was concerned.|s
me010|oh yeah the high school's a great idea.|s^aa|s^ba^r
mn015|so|fh
mn015|but i i will just make a first draft of the uh note.|s^cc^rt
mn015|the write up note.|s^e
mn015|send it to you and fey.|s^cc
mn015|and then|%-
me010|and why don't you also copy jane on it?|qh^cs
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|are we have we concurred that uh these these forms are sufficient for us and necessary?|qy
me010|uh i think they're necessary.|s
me010|this the permission form.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|nuh.|b
me010|uh there has to be one.|s
me010|and i think we're just going to use it as it is.|s
me010|and um|fh
mn015|n.  .|b.%
mn015|you happy with that?|qy
me010|well yeah.|s^aa
me010|there's one tricky part about|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|they have the right|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|the last paragraph if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set.|s:s
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|now that had to be included for this other one.|s
me010|which might have uh meetings you know about something.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|in this case it doesn't really make sense.|s
me010|um so what i'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying i don't want to see the final transcript.|fh|s:s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|and if they don't if they say no i'm not willing to sign that then we'll show them the final transcript.|s:s
me010|but um|fh
mn015|yep makes sense.|s^bk|s^ba
me010|that uh|%--
me010|yeah so we might actually|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|jane may say that you know you can't do this.|s:s
me010|uh on the same form we need a separate form.|s
me010|but anyway i'd i'd i'd like to um add a little uh a thing for them to initial saying nah i don't want to see the final transcript.|s:s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|but other than that that's one's been approved.|s
me010|this really is the same project.|s
me010|uh|s.%--
me010|you know|fh
me010|and so forth.|s
me010|so i think we just go with it.|s^cs
mn015|yeah.|b.%
mn015|yeah.|b.%
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so much for the data.|s^t^tc
mn015|except that with munich everything is fine now.|s
mn015|they're going to transcribe.|s
mn015|they're also going to translate the uh german data from the t. v and cinema stuff for andreas.|s
mn015|so|fh
mn015|they're they all seem to be happy now with that.|s
mn015|so|fh
mn015|should we move on to the technical sides?|qy^rt^t^tc
me010|yep.|s^aa
mn015|well i guess the good good news of last week was the parser.|s
mn015|so um|fh
mn015|bhaskara and i started working on the the parser.|s
mn015|then bhaskara went to class and once he came back um it was finished.|s
mn015|so|fh
mn015|it uh i didn't measure it.|s
mn015|but it was about an hour and ten minutes.|s^bu^rt
me012|yep.|s^bk
me012|something like that.|s
mn015|and um and now it's we have a complete english parser that does everything the german parser does.|s
me010|which is not a lot.|s^2^ba
me012|that's the uh point.|s
me010|but|%-
mn015|the uh that's not a lot.|s
me012|yes.|b
me010|okay.|b
me010|right.|s^bk
mn015|and um|fh
fe004|what did you end up having to do?|qw
fe004|i mean was there anything interesting about it at all?|qy^e
mn015|well if you uh|s.%-
me012|we'll show you.|s
me010|yeah we can show us.|s^aa|s
fe004|or are we going to see that?|qrr
me010|right?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|well we the first we did is we we tried to to do change the the laufen into run or running or runs.|s:s
me010|yep.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and we noticed that whatever we tried to do it no effect.|s
fe004|okay.|b
mn015|and we were puzzled.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|and uh the reason was that the parser completely ignores the verb.|s
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|so this sentence sentence is parses the the same output.|s
fe004|interesting parser property.|s^ba
mn015|um even if you leave out um all all of this.|s^e^rt
fe004|i see.|s^bk
fe004|yeah.|b.%
mn015|so it's basically feature film and t. v.|s:s
fe004|today.|s^2
mn015|that's what you need.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|and the and the time right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|if if you'd add add today and evening it'll add time or not.|s^aap
mn015|so it it does look at that.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|but all the rest is simply frosting on the cake.|s
mn015|and it's optional for that parser.|s
fe004|true.|s^aa
me010|so you can you you are are you going to show us the little templates?|qy^rt
mn015|and|fh
mn015|yeah we we can uh i can show you the templates.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|the former end|s.%--
mn015|i i also have it running here.|s
fe004|oh i see.|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so if i do this now um you can see that it parsed the wonderful english sentence which films are on the cinema today evening.|s:qw
mn015|but um|fh
me010|well that sounds|s^ba.%-
mn015|uh don't worry about it.|s^co
mn015|it could be this evening which which films are on the cinema.|s^df:qw
me010|no|s^ar|%-
mn015|or running in the cinema.|s^e:s
mn015|which|%--
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|uh today evening uh is anything happening in the cinema this evening.|s:qy
fe004|okay key words basically.|s^bk|s
me010|well|%-
mn015|elaborate or more or less uh|s.%-
me010|actually it's a little tricky in that there's some allowable german orders which aren't allowable english orders and so forth.|s
me010|and it is order based.|s^bu
me010|so it it|s.%--
me010|isn't it?|qy^rt
me012|no.|s^ar
mn015|no.|s^ar
me010|oh so it it it these these optional elements|s^bk|s.%--
mn015|it is not|s.%-
me010|it's it's actually a set?|qy^bu^d
me010|not a sequence.|s^e^rt
mn015|yeah we were i was afraid that um|s^aa|s.%-
me010|oh.|s^bk
fe004|so it really is key word matching basically.|s
me010|really a|s.%-
mn036|yeah.|b
mn015|um|fh
mn036|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|oh wow!|s^ba^fe
mn015|um i mean these sentences are just silly.|s
fe004|huh.|b.%
mn015|i mean uh these were not the ones we we actually did it.|s
mn015|um|fg
mn015|what's an idiomatic of phrasing this?|qw
mn015|which films are showing.|s:qw
me012|are playing at the cinema.|s^2:s
mn015|playing.|s^m
me012|yeah.|b
fe004|tonight.|s^e^rt
me012|i changed that file actually where it's on my account.|s
fe004|this this evening.|s^e
mn036|actually you would say which films are on tonight.|s:qw
me012|you want to get it?|qy^rt
me012|or is was it easy to get it?|qy^rt
mn015|um i have no net here.|h|s
me012|oh okay.|s^bk
me010|do i?|qy^t1
mn015|okay so wonderful parse.|fg|s^ba^t
mn015|same thing.|s
mn015|um|fh
me010|right.|b
mn015|except that we we don't have this uh time information here now.|s
mn015|which is|%--
mn015|um|fh
mn015|oh this are the reserve.|s
mn015|anyways so|fg
mn015|um these are the sort of the ten different sentence types that the uh the parser was able to do.|fh|s^rt
mn015|and it still is now in english.|s^rt
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|sorry.|s^fa
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate right?|s^bu|qy^d^f^g
me012|yeah i mean i changed those sentences to make it uh more uh idiomatic.|s^aa|s
me012|and of course you can have many variations in those sentences they will still parse fine.|s
me012|so in a sense it's pretty broad.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so if you want to look at the templates they're conveniently located in a file template.|s
mn015|um|fh
mn015|and this is what i had to do.|s
mn015|i had to change spielfilm to film.|s:s
mn015|uh film to movie.|s:s
mn015|kino to cinema.|s^rt:s
mn015|today heute to today.|s:s
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|evening abend to evening.|s:s
me010|capitalized as well.|s^e
me003|huh.|b.%
mn015|and um|fh
me012|one thing i was wondering was those functions there are those things that modify the m. three l. basically?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and that's that's the next step.|s
mn015|but we'll get to that in a second.|s
mn015|and so this means um|s.%--
me010|oh.|b.%
mn015|this and see are not optional.|s:s
mn015|want i like is all maybe in there.|s:s
mn015|but may also not be in there.|s
me010|so so the point is if it says this and see it also will work in see and this.|s^bu^rt:s
me010|in the other order.|s^e
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|with those two key words.|s^e
mn015|should we try it?|qy^rt
me010|this is the one i want to see.|s
me010|or whatever.|s^e
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|action watch.|s^rt:s
me012|huh.|b
mn015|whatever.|s
mn015|nothing was specified.|s
mn015|except that it has some references to audio visual media here.|s
me012|a. v medium.|s^e
me012|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|where it gets that from|s.%--
mn015|it's correct.|s^df
mn015|but i don't know where it gets it from.|s^df^no
me012|see.|s:s
mn015|oh see.|s^bk|s:s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me012|i mean it's sort of|s.%-
mn015|yeah yep okay.|s^bk
mn015|and see this is exactly the same thing.|s:s
me010|okay so it is set based.|s^bk|s
me010|all right.|s^bk
me012|one thing i was wondering was those percentage signs right.|s|s^f
me012|so i mean why do we even have them?|qw
me012|because if you didn't have them|s^df.%-
mn015|yep.|s^bk
mn015|uh i'll tell you why.|s
mn015|because it gives a you a score.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me012|oh.|s^bk
mn015|and the value of the score is i assume i guess the more of these optional things that are actually in there the higher the score it is.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
mn036|right.|s^bk
fe004|it's a match.|s
me012|so that's the main purpose all right.|s|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn015|so we we shouldn't belittle it too much.|s
mn015|it's doing something.|s^df
mn015|some things.|s^bsc
mn015|and it's very flexible.|s
mn015|i've just tried to|s.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn036|right.|b
mn015|be nice.|s
me010|no no.|s^aa
fe004|right yeah.|b
me010|fine.|s^ba
me010|yeah yeah yeah flexible it is.|s^aa|s^na
mn036|but|%-
mn015|okay um let's hope that the generation will not be more difficult.|fg|s^tc
mn015|even though the generator is a little bit more complex.|s
mn015|uh but we'll|s.%--
mn015|huh|b
mn015|that means we may need two hours and twenty minutes rather than an hour ten minutes.|s
me012|right.|s^bk
mn015|i hope.|s
me010|all right.|b.%
mn015|and the next thing i would like to be able to do and it seems like this would not be too difficult either is to say okay let's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the the mapping of of uh words to the m. three l. but we also wanted to change add a new sentence type.|s^tc
mn015|and and make up some some new m. threel.|s.%-
me010|yep.|s^aa
me010|that'd be great.|s^ba
me010|it would be a good exercise to just see whether one can get that to run.|s
mn015|see|%-
mn015|uhhuh yep.|s^aa
mn015|and um|fh
me012|so that's|%-
me012|fine yeah.|b
mn015|that's shouldn't be too tough.|s
me012|yeah so where are those|fg|qw.%--
me012|those functions action goodbye and so on right.|s|s^f
me012|are they actually um are they going to be called?|qy^rt
me012|um are they present in the code for the parser?|qy^rt
mn015|yeah i think what it does it it does something sort of fancy.|s^aa|s
mn015|it loads|s.%--
mn015|um|fh
mn015|it has these style sheets and also the um schemata.|s^rt
mn015|so what it probably does is it takes the|s.%--
mn015|uh um|fh
mn015|is this where it is?|qy^t1
mn015|this is already the x. m. l stuff.|s^rt^t1
mn015|this is where it takes its own um syntax.|s
mn015|and converts it somehow.|s
mn015|um|fh
mn015|where is the uh|qw.%--
me012|what are you looking for?|qw
mn015|um where it actually produces the the x. m. l out of the uh parsed stuff.|s
me012|oh okay.|s^bk
mn015|no this is not it.|s^t1
mn015|uh i can't find it now.|s
mn015|you mean where the where the how the action goodbye maps into something|s^bu.%--
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me003|yeah where are those constructors defined?|s^aa|qw
me012|oh.|s^bk
mn015|nope.|s^ar^t1
me012|no that's not it.|s^aa|s^na
mn015|yeah.|fh
mn015|this is sort of what happens.|s
mn015|this is what you would need to to change to get the uh x. m. l changed.|s
mn015|so when it encounters day it will uh|s.%--:s
mn015|activate those classes in the in the x. m. l stuff.|s
mn015|but um|fh
mn015|i saw those actions uh the goodbye stuff somewhere.|s:s
mn015|huh huh huh huh huh.|b
me003|grep for it?|qy^bu^cs^d^rt
mn015|yeah let's do that.|s^aa|s^na
mn015|oh.|s^bk
me012|huh.|b
me012|m. three l. dot d. t. d.|s^bu^rt:s
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me012|that's just a specification for the x. m. l format.|s
mn015|yep.|s^aa
mn015|well we'll find that out.|s^cc
mn015|so whatever this does|s.%--
mn015|i mean this is basically looks to me like a function call right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me010|huh?|qw^br
me010|oh yeah.|s^aa
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|so whenever it it encounters goodbye|s.%--:s
mn015|which we can make it do in a second here.|s^rt
me003|that function automatically generates an initialized x. m. l structure.|s^bu
me012|i think each of those functions act on the current x. m. l structure and change it in some way for example by adding a a a field to it or something.|s
me010|yeah they also seem to affect state.|fg|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|cause some of them|s^df.%--
me010|there were other actions uh that that seemed to step state variables somewhere.|s
me012|right.|b
me010|like the discourse status confirm.|s:s
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me010|okay so that's going to be a call on the discourse.|s
me010|and confirm that it's|s.%-
mn015|uhhuh|%-
me012|oh you mean that's not going to actually modify the tree.|s^bk|s^bu
me012|but it's going to change the event.|s
me010|i think that's right.|s^na
me010|i think it's actually that looks like it's state modification.|s
me012|oh oh.|s^bk
mn015|huh|%-
mn015|um well|s.%--
mn015|there is a feature called discourse status.|s:s
me012|when there's a feature.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|and so whenever i just say write it will it will put this in here.|s:s
me010|oh so it always just|s^bk|s^bu.%--
me010|is it so it|qy.%--
me010|well go back then.|s^co
me010|because it may be that all those things while they look like function calls are just a way of adding exactly that to the x. m. l.|s^df
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me010|uhhuh.|s^bk
me010|i'm not i'm not sure.|s^no
mn015|so this|%-
me010|i'm not sure that|s.%-
mn015|um well we we'll see when we say|s.%--
mn015|let's test something.|s
mn015|goodbye causes it to to create basically an action goodbye end action.|s:s
mn015|which is a means of telling the system to shut down.|s
me010|right.|b
me010|right.|s^bk
mn015|now if we know that write produces a feature discourse status confirm discourse status.|s:s
mn015|so if i now say write goodbye it should do that.|s:s
mn015|it it creates this.|s^rt
me012|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|right.|b
mn015|confirm goodbye.|s:s
me012|right there.|s
me010|yep.|b
me012|but there is some kind of function call.|s^bu
me012|because how does it know to put goodbye in content but uh confirm in features?|qw^df
mn015|oh.|s^bk
mn015|it it that's because|s.%-
me012|so it's not just that it's adding that field.|s
me012|it's|%-
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|absolutely.|s^aa
me012|okay.|s^bk
me010|good point.|s^ba
me010|it's it's the it's under what subtype you're doing it.|s^e
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|yeah.|b
me003|it's mystery functions.|s^j
me012|well they're defined somewhere presumably.|s^nd
mn015|well sometimes it sometimes|s.%-
me010|yeah each is|fg|%--
mn015|when it|%-
me010|so that's funny.|s^ba
me010|you bury the the state in the function.|s
me010|all right.|s^bk
me010|uh|fh
me003|well it just automatically initializes things that are common right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
mn015|it|%-
me003|so it's just a shorthand.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|for example|s.%--
mn015|oh this is german.|s
mn015|sorry.|s^fa
mn015|so now this it cannot do anymore.|s
mn015|nothing comes out of here.|s
me003|a not a number is a value awesome.|s|s^ba
mn015|so it doesn't speak german anymore.|s
mn015|but it does speak english.|s
mn015|and there is here a reference.|s
mn015|so this tells us that whatever is has the i. d zero is referenced here by the restriction seed.|s:s
mn015|and this is i want|s.%--
mn015|what was the sentence?|qw
me010|i want two seats here.|s
mn015|need two seats here nuh.|s^m|s^aa
mn015|and where is it playing there should also be a reference to something maybe.|s^cs:s^am
mn015|our this is um|s.%--
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|here we change and so we here we add something to the discourse status that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before.|s
mn015|and uh|fh
mn015|and that whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema.|s
me003|so then whatever takes this m. three l. is what actually changes the state.|s^bu
me003|not the|s.%--
me003|yeah okay.|s^bk
me010|no right the discourse maintainer.|s^aa|s
me003|yeah.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|i see.|s^bk
me010|and it and it runs around looking for discourse status tags.|s
me010|and doing whatever it does with them.|s
me010|and other people ignore those tags.|s
me010|all right.|s^bk
me010|so yeah i definitely think it's it's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there.|fh|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|uh|fh
mn015|sort of get a complete understanding of the whole thing.|s^na.x
me010|yeah a kid understanding what's going on.|s^aa|s^na
me010|then the next thing we talked about is actually um figuring out how to add our own tags and stuff like that.|s^t^tc
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|point number two.|s^tc
mn015|i got the uh m. three l. for the routes today.|s
mn015|uh so i got some more.|s
mn015|this is sort of the|s.%--
mn015|uh um|fh
mn015|huh.|s^bk
mn015|interesting.|s^ba
mn015|it's just going up.|s
mn015|it's not going back down.|s
mn015|so this is um what i got today is the the new um m. three l. for um the maps.|s^rt
me010|yep.|b
mn015|uh and with some examples.|s
mn015|so this is the x. m. l and this is sort of what it will look like later on.|s^rt
mn015|even though it you can't see it on on this resolution.|s
mn015|and this is what it sort of is the the structure of map requests.|s
mn015|um|fh
mn015|also not very interesting.|s^ba
mn015|and here is the more interesting stuff for us is the routes.|s^rt
mn015|route elements.|s^rt
mn015|and again as we thought it's really simple.|s
mn015|this is sort of the uh um parameters.|s
mn015|we have simple from objects and to objects and so forth.|s
mn015|points of interest along the way.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|i asked them whether or not we could um|s.%--
mn015|first of all i was little bit|s.%--
mn015|it seemed to me that this way of doing it is sort of a a step backwards from the way we've done it before.|s
mn015|it seems to me that some notions were missing.|s
mn015|so these are these are|s.%-
me010|so these are these are your friends back at e. m. l.|s^bu
mn015|yep.|s^aa
mn015|who are doing this.|s^na
me010|so this is not a complicated negotiation.|s^bu
mn015|no.|s^aa
me010|there's there's not seven committees or anything right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
mn015|no this is very straightforward.|s^aa|s^na
me010|great.|s^ba
me010|so this is just trying to|s.%--
me010|it's a design thing not a political thing.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|once we've uh we can just sort of agree on what ought to be done.|s
mn015|exactly.|s^aa
me010|good.|s^ba
mn015|and um|fg
mn015|and uh|fh
mn015|however the uh so that you understand it is really simple.|s
mn015|uh you you have a route.|s^rt
mn015|and you cut it up in different pieces.|s
mn015|and every every element of that of that every segment we call a route element.|s:s
mn015|and so from a.   to b.   we cut up in three different steps.|s^rt
mn015|and every step has a from object where you start a to object.|s
mn015|where where you sort of end and some points of interest along the way.|s
mn015|what i was sort of missing here and uh maybe it was just me being too stupid is i didn't sort of get the the notion of the global goal of the whole route.|s
mn015|really was not straightforward visibly for me.|s
mn015|and some other stuff.|s
mn015|and i suggested that they should be uh kind enough to do two things for us.|s
mn015|is one um also allocating uh some tags for our action schema enter vista approach.|s^rt:s^rt
mn015|and|fh
mn015|and also um since you had suggested that that um we figure out if we ever for a demo reason wanted to shortcut directly to the g. i. s and the planner|fh|s.%--
mn015|of how we can do it.|s^e
mn015|now what's the state of the art of getting to entrances.|s
mn015|um what's the syntax for that?|qh
mn015|how getting to vista points and calculating those on the spot?|qh
mn015|and the approach mode anyhow is the default.|s
mn015|that's all they do it these days.|s
mn015|wherever you'll find a route planner it does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is at minimal distance to the geometric center.|s.x
me010|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so|fh
me010|so well let now this is important.|fg|s^ba
me010|let uh i want again outside of almost managerial point|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|you're in the midst of this.|s^df
me010|so you know better.|s^df^e
me010|but it seems to me it's probably a good idea to uh minimize the number of uh change requests we make of them.|s^cs
me010|so it seemed to me what we ought to do is get our story together.|s^cs
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|and think about it some internally before asking them to make changes.|s^cs^e
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|oh|fh
me010|does this does this make sense to you guys?|qy
me010|it i mean you're you're doing the the interaction.|s^bd
me010|but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a uh something where you um|s^cs^df.%--
me010|and i i don't know who's working most closely on it.|s
me010|probably johno.|s^am
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|uh take what they have.|s
me010|send it to everybody saying this is what they have.|s:s
me010|this is what we think we should add.|s:s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|and then have a a an iteration within our group saying huh well|s.%--:s.%--
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|and get our best idea of what we should add.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|and then go back to them.|s
me010|is|%--
me010|or i don't know.|s^bd^no
me010|does this make sense to you?|qy^rt
me010|or|qrr.%--
mn015|yeah especially if we want|s^aa|s.%--
mn015|sort of what i my feeling was we we sort of reserved something that has a an okay label.|s:s
mn015|that's that was my first sort of step.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
mn015|no matter how we want to call it this is sort of our playground.|s
mn015|and if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and and and and and complex enough to to to maybe enable a whole simulation one of these days that would be the the perfect goal.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|right.|b
me010|that's right.|s^na
me010|so|fg
me010|so yeah.|fg
me010|the problem isn't the short range optimization.|s
me010|it's the sort of one or two year kind of thing.|s
me010|okay what are the class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two?|s^f|qh
me010|how how would we try to characterize those?|qh
me010|and what do we want to request now that's leave enough space to do all that stuff?|qw
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|yep.|s^bk
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|and that that requires some thought.|s
mn015|yep.|b
me010|and so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item.|s
me010|um as soon as we can do it.|s^e
mn015|yep.|s^bk
me010|so so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um this.|s
me010|and the uh description.|s^e
me003|with yeah suggested improvements.|s^2
me003|and|%--
me010|well|%--
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|so the the uh not everyone uh reads german.|s^df
me010|so if you'd|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me003|huh.|b
me010|uh change the description to uh english.|s^cs
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|and um|fh
me010|then then|%--
me010|yeah then with some suggestions about where where do we go from here?|fh|qh^cs
me010|uh this and this of course was just the action end.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|uh at some point we're going to have to worry about the language end.|s
me010|but for the moment just uh for this class of of things we might want to try to encompass.|s
me010|and|fh
me003|then the scope of this is beyond approach and or vista.|s
me010|oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
me003|yeah yeah.|s^bk
me010|this is this is everything that that um you know um we might want to do in the next couple years.|s
me003|yeah yeah.|b
me003|so what would|s^bu.%--
mn015|huh.|b.%
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|we don't i mean that's an issue.|s
me010|we don't know what entirely.|s^no
me003|uh yeah.|s^bk
me003|but i'm just|s.%--
me003|but the|s^df.%--
me003|yeah okay.|s^bk
me003|so i just|s.%--
me003|this x. m. l stuff here just has to do with source path goal type stuff.|s
me003|in terms of traveling through heidelberg.|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|right.|s^aa
me003|or travel specifically.|s^e
me003|so but this is the domain greater than that?|qy
me010|no.|s^ar
me010|i think i think the the idea is that|s.%--
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|oh it's beyond source path goal.|fh|s
me010|but i think we don't need to get beyond it tourists in heidelberg.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|it seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in heidelberg.|s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me010|but you know depending on what people are interested in one could have uh tours.|s
me010|one could have um explanations of why something is is you know why why was this done.|s
me010|or|%--
me010|i mean no there's no end.|s
me010|to the complexity you can build into the uh what a tourist in heidelberg might ask.|s^e
me003|huh.|b
me010|so at least unless somebody else wants to suggest otherwise i think the general domain we don't have to uh broaden.|s^cs
me010|that is tourists in heidelberg.|s^e
me010|and if there's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way then sure.|s
me010|we'll we'll look at that.|s
me010|but uh|fh
me010|i'd be i'd be surprised at|s.%--
me010|if there's any important issue that that|s.%--
me010|and um|fh
me010|i mean if if you want to uh push us into reference problems that would be great.|s^ba^cs
mn036|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay so this is his specialty is reference.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|and you know what what are these things referring to?|qh^e
me010|not only anaphora.|s
me010|but uh more generally the uh this whole issue of uh referring expressions.|s
me010|and what is it that they're actually dealing with in the world?|qh
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|and again this is in the this is also pretty well formed.|s
me010|because there is an ontology.|s
me010|and the database and stuff.|s
me010|so it isn't like um you know the evening star or stuff like that.|s
mn036|right.|b
me010|it|%--
me010|all the entities do have concrete reference.|s
mn036|right.|b
me010|although the to get at them from a language may not be trivial.|s
mn036|right.|b
me010|there aren't really deep mysteries about um what what things the system knows about.|s
mn036|right.|b
mn036|and you have both proper names and descriptions.|s
mn036|and and you can ask for it.|s^e
me010|all those things.|s^na
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|you have proper names and descriptions.|s
mn036|right.|b
mn036|okay.|s^bk
me010|and a and a lot and and anaphora and pronouns.|s
mn015|nuh.|b
mn036|right.|b
me010|and all those things.|s
mn036|right.|b
mn015|now we the the whole unfortunately the whole database is uh in german.|s
mn015|we have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it.|s
mn015|i. e the the shortest the the more general descriptions of all the objects and um persons and events.|s
mn015|so it's a relational database with persons events and um objects.|s^rt
mn015|and it's it's quite um there.|s
mn015|but did i uh i think there will be great.|s
mn015|because the reference problem really is not trivial even if you have such a well defined world.|s^df
me010|he knows.|s
mn015|you are not uh throwing uh uh carrying owls to athens.|s
me003|could you give me an example of a reference problem?|qy
me003|so so i can make it more concrete.|s^df^e
mn015|well how do i get to the powder tower.|s:qw
mn015|we sort of think that our bit in this problem is interesting.|s
mn015|but just to get from powder tower to an object i. d in a database is also not really trivial.|s
mn036|or or if you take something even more scary um how do i get to the third building after the tower.|s:qw
mn036|the powder tower.|s^bsc
me003|huh.|b
mn036|uh you need some mechanism for|s.%-
me010|yeah.|b.%
me010|or you know the church across from city hall.|s
me010|or|%-
me003|or the the restaurant where they wear lederhosen.|s^bu
mn015|or|%-
mn036|right.|s^aa
me003|or is that|qr.%-
me010|yeah that would be fine.|s^aa|s^ba
mn036|right.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|s^bk
mn036|right.|b
mn015|or or tower or this tower or that building or|s.%--
fe004|uniquely.|s
mn015|huh.|b
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|or you can say how you know how do i get back.|s:qw
me003|trying to|%-
me003|yeah yeah.|s^bk
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|and again it's just a question of which of these things uh people want to dive into.|s
me010|what uh i think i'm going to try to do|s.%--
me010|and i guess pwww.|s:s^fe
me010|let's say that by the end of spring break i'll try to come up with some general story about um construction grammar.|s
me010|and what constructions we'd use.|s
me010|and how all this might fit together.|s
me010|there's this whole framework problem that i'm feeling really uncomfortable about.|s
me010|and i haven't had a chance to think about it seriously.|s
me010|but i i want to i want to do that early rather than late.|s
me010|and you and i will probably have to talk about this some.|s
mn015|that's what strikes me that we sort of.|s
mn015|the uh small|s.%--
mn015|something uh maybe we should address one of these days is to that most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements.|s
mn015|and and analyze those.|s^e
mn015|whether it's abstracts or newspapers and stuff like this.|s
me010|huh.|b
mn015|but the whole is it is it really relevant that we are dealing mostly with sort of questions?|qy^rt
mn015|uh you know|s.%--
me010|oh yeah.|s^aa
me010|well i mean|s.%--
me010|yeah|s^aa|%-
mn015|and this is it seems to me that we should maybe at least spend a session or or brainstorm a little bit about whether that this is special case in that sense.|s^cs
me012|uhhuh.|b
mn015|um|fh
mn015|i don't know.|s^bd^no
mn015|you know did we ever find metaphorical use in in questions in in that sense really?|qy^rt
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|you will.|s
mn015|and how soon?|qh
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
me010|oh yeah.|s^bk
me010|i mean uh we could take all the standard metaphor examples and make question versions of them.|s^cs
me010|okay.|s^f
mn015|who got kicked out of france.|s:qw
mn015|nuh.|s^bk
me010|yeah or you know why is he why is he pushing for promotion.|s^aa|s^cs:qw
mn036|right.|b
me010|or who's pushing|s.%--:qw.%--
mn015|nuh.|b
me010|uh just pick pick any of them.|s
me010|and just do the uh|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|so i don't i don't think uh it's at all difficult uh to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|and sort of we don't know how to handle them too.|s
me010|right?|qy^d^f^g
me010|i mean it's|s.%--
me010|i it|%--
me010|we don't know how to handle the declarative forms really.|s
me010|and then the interrogative forms uhoh.|s:s
me010|uh|fh
me012|ooo.|b.%
me010|yeah.|b
me010|nancy it looked like you were|s.%-
fe004|oh it's just that that the goals are very different to cases.|s^bk|s
fe004|so we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain actually.|s
fe004|was that most of the things we talked about are our story understanding.|s
fe004|uh we're going to have a short discourse.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|and the person talking is trying to i don't know give you a statement and tell you something.|s
fe004|and here it's|s.%-
mn015|help you create a mental model blah blah blah.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|uh yeah i guess so.|s^aa|s^na
me010|yes.|s^aa
fe004|and then here you are uh the person is getting information.|s
fe004|and they or may not be following some larger plan you know that we have to recognize or you know infer.|s
fe004|and the their discourse patterns probably don't follow quite as many logical|s.%-
me010|right no i think that's one of things that's interesting.|s^aa|s
fe004|yeah.|fh
me010|is is in this sort of over-arching story we we worked it out for as you say this the storytelling scenario.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|and i think it's really worth thinking through what it looks like.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|what is the simspec mean et cetera?|qh^e
fe004|right because for a while we were thinking well how can we change the um data to sort of illicit illicit um actions that are more like what we are used to.|s^aa|s
fe004|but obviously we would rather you know try to figure out what's what's you know|s.%-
me010|well i don't know.|s^no
me010|i mean maybe maybe that's what we'll do is is|s.%--
me010|we can do anything we want with it.|s
fe004|yep.|s^bk
me010|i mean once we have fulfilled these requirements|s.%--
fe004|huh uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|okay and the one for next uh summer is just half done.|s^f|s
me010|and then the other half is this um generation thing which we think isn't much different.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|so once that's done then all the rest of it is uh sort of you know what we want to do for the research.|s
me010|and we can we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all.|s
me010|there's no reason why we're we're constrained to do that.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|if we can use all the uh execution engines then we can you know really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but there's no obligation on any of this.|s
me010|so if we want to turn it into standing stories about heidelberg we can do that.|s
me010|i mean that would just be a um|s.%-
mn015|or as a matter of fact we need and if we if uh take a ten year perspective we need to do that.|s^aap
mn015|because|s^df.%--
mn015|assuming we have this um in that case we actually do have these wonderful stories and historical anecdotes.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|and knights jumping out of windows.|s^e
fe004|huh.|b.%
mn015|and and and tons of stuff.|s^e
mn015|so the database is huge.|s
mn015|and if we want to answer a question on that we actually have to go one step before that and understand that.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|in order to do sensible information extraction.|s^e
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and so|fh
me010|you might yeah.|s^am|s^aa
mn015|um this has been a a a deep map research issue that was is is part of the unresolved and to-do's and something for the future is how can we sort of run our our text our content through a machine that will enable us later to retrieve or answer questions more sensibly?|qh
mn036|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|huh.|b
me010|right.|b
me010|anyway.|fg
me010|who's going?|qw^t3
mn036|so uh so uh i was just going to ask.|fg|s
mn036|um so|fh
mn036|what is the the basic thing that that you are um obligated to do um uh by the summer before uh we can move|qw.%-
me010|uh.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so uh yeah|fh
me010|so what happened is|s.%--
me010|there's this uh uh|s.%--
me010|robert was describing|s.%--
me010|the there's two packages.|s
me010|there's a uh quote parser.|s
me010|there's a particular piece of this big system.|s
me010|which in german uh takes these sentence templates and produces x. m. l structures.|s
mn036|right.|b
me010|and one of our jobs was to make the english equivalent of that.|s
me010|that these guys did in a in a day.|s
mn036|right.|b
mn036|right.|b
me010|the other thing is at the other end roughly at the same level there's something that takes uh x. m. l structures produces an output x. m. l structure.|s
me010|which is instructions for the generator.|s
mn036|right.|b
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|and then there's a language generator.|s
me010|and then after that a a synthesizer that goes from an x. m. l structure to uh language generation to actual specifications for a synthesizer.|s
me010|uh but again there's one module in which there's one piece that we have to convert to english.|s
mn036|right.|b
mn036|right.|b
mn036|got it.|s^bk
me010|is that|qy.%--
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|and that but as i say this is all along was viewed as a kind of a a minor thing.|s
me010|necessary but but not|s.%-
mn036|right.|s^bk
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn036|right.|b
me010|and much more interesting is the fact that as part of doing this we we are you know inheriting this system that does all of these other things.|s
mn036|that's great.|s^ba
mn036|right.|b
me010|not precisely what we want.|s
me010|and that's that's where it it gets difficult.|s
me010|and i i don't pretend to understand yet what i think we really ought to do.|s
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so enough of that.|fg|s^rt^t^tc
mn015|but i uh um|s.%--
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|the sort of johno and i will take up that responsibility.|s^cc^rt
mn015|and um get a first draft of that.|s
mn015|now we have um just i think two more short things.|s^t
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|um you guys sort of started fighting uh on the bayes-net noisy or front?|fh|qy^bu^d^rt
me012|huh.|b.%
me012|yeah i thought i should um talk a little bit about that.|s^aa|s
me012|because that might be a good uh sort of architecture to have in general for uh problems with you know multiple inputs to a node.|s^df
me010|good okay.|s^ba|s^bk
me010|good.|s^ba
me010|and what's the other one?|qw
me010|so that just we know what the agenda is.|s^df
mn015|um the wu paper.|s
mn015|i think maybe|s.%-
me010|oh yeah.|s^bk
me010|i've got a couple new wu papers as well.|s
me010|uh so i i've been in contact with wu.|s
me010|so probably let's put that off till i i till i understand better uh what he's doing.|s
me010|it's just a little embarrassing.|s
me010|cause all this was in his thesis.|s
me010|and i was on his thesis committee.|s
me010|and so i really knew this at one time.|s
mn036|ugh.|b
me010|but i i it's not only uh is part of what i haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together.|s
me010|so i'll dig up some more stuff from dekai.|s^cc
me010|and so why don't we just do the uh|qh^cs.%-
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|so|fg
me012|should i is there a white board here that i can use?|qy^rt
me010|yeah you could|s^aa|s.%-
me012|uh|fh
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me012|or shall i just use this?|qrr
me010|squealing sound.|s.%
me010|it's probably just as easy.|s^am
mn036|yeah.|s^bk
me012|yeah.|s^bk
me003|you can put the microphone in your pocket.|s^cs
me012|hey.|s^ba
me003|i was envying you and your pocket.|s
me003|cause i don't have one.|s^df
fe004|it was a quick one huh?|s|qy^d^g
me010|that's why they invented pocket t. 's.|s
fe004|they have clips.|s
me003|exactly.|s^aa
fe004|huh.|b
me012|yeah.|s^bk
me012|so um recall that uh we want to have this kind of structure in our bayes-nets.|fg|s^tc
me012|namely that um you have these nodes that have several bands right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me012|so|fh
me012|does i mean they sort of|s.%--
me012|the typical example is that um these are all a bunch of cues for something.|s^rt
me012|and this is a certain effect that we'd like to conclude.|s
me012|so uh|fh
me012|like let's just look at the case when um this is actually the the final action right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me012|so this is like uh you know touch.|s
me012|or|%--
me012|sorry.|s^fa
mn015|e.   eva.|s
me012|uh|fh
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|e.   e. v. a right?|s^m|qy^d^f^g
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me012|enter view approach right?|s|qy^d^f^g
mn036|what was this?|qw
mn036|it uh uh|s.%--
me012|so this is|s.%-
me010|write it out for|s^co.%-
me012|yeah.|s^bk
mn036|i mean|s.%--
me012|enter.|s:s
me012|view.|s:s
me012|approach.|s:s
mn036|okay right.|s^bk
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|so i mean we'd like to take all these various cues right?|s|qy^d^f^g
mn036|like the army.|s^e^t3
me012|so this one might be say uh|s.%--
mn036|yeah.|b
fe004|new terminology.|s^t3
me012|well let me pick a random one.|s
mn015|huh?|b.%
fe004|i haven't heard that before.|s^t3
me012|and say uh|s.%--
me012|i don't know.|s^no
me012|it could be like this isn't the way it really is.|s^df^rt
me012|but let me say that suppose someone mentioned uh admission fees|s.%--
me012|uh it takes too long.|s^ba^bd
me012|try let me just say landmark.|s:s
me012|if the thing is a landmark you know um then there's another thing that says if um|s.%--
me012|if it's closed or not at the moment|s^rt.%--
me012|all right so you have nodes.|s^bk|s
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|and the uh problem that we were having was that you know given n. nodes there's two to the n|s.%--
me012|given n. nodes and furthermore the fact that there's three things here we need to specify three times uh two to the n probabilities.|s
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|that's assuming these are all binary which they may not be.|s
me012|for example they could be time of day.|s
me012|in which case we could uh say you know morning afternoon evening night.|s
me012|so this could be more.|s
me012|so it's a lot anyway.|s
me012|and that's a lot of probabilities to put here which is kind of a pain.|s
me012|so noisy-ors are a way to uh sort of deal with this.|fh|s
me012|um|fh
me012|where should i put this?|qw^t1
me012|so the idea is that um let's call these uh c. one c. two c. three and c. four and e.   for cause and effect i guess.|s:s
me012|the idea is to have these intermediate nodes.|s
me012|right.|s^f
me012|well actually the idea first of all is that each of these things has a quote unquote distinguished state.|s
me012|which means that this is the state in which we don't really know anything about it.|s
me012|so|fh
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|so for example if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not or if that just doesn't seem relevant then that would be sort of the the distinguish state.|s
me012|it's a really you know if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee|s.%--
me012|you know if they didn't talk about it that would be the distinguish state.|s
me012|so|%-
mn015|so this is a fanciful way of saying default?|qy^bu^d^rt
me012|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn015|okay.|s^bk
me012|that's just what they the word they used in that paper.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me012|so the idea is that um you have these intermediate nodes right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me012|e. one e. two e. three and e. four.|s^rt:s^rt
me010|so this is the heckerman paper you're working with.|s^bu
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me010|good.|s^ba
me012|so the idea is that each of these e. i is represents what this would be if all the other ones were in the distinguish state right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me012|so for example suppose that the person i mean suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark.|s
me012|but none of the other sort of cues really apply.|s^e
me012|then this would be|s.%--
me012|the this would just represent the probability distribution of this|s.%--
me012|assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply.|s
me012|so you know if it is a landmark and none of the other things really applicable then this would represent the probability distribution.|s
me012|so maybe in this case maybe we just maybe we decide that if the thing's a landmark and we don't know anything else then we're going to conclude that um they want to view it with probability you know point four.|s^rt
me012|they want to enter it with probability uh with probability point five.|s
me012|and they want to approach it probability point one say.|s
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|so we come up with these little tables for each of those.|s
me012|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me012|and the final thing is that um this is a deterministic function of these.|s^df
me012|so we don't need to specify any probabilities.|s
me012|we just have to um say what function this is right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me012|so we can let this be um g.   of e. one comma e. two e. three e. four right.|s:s|qy^d^f^g
me012|and our example g.   would be um a majority vote.|s^rt:s
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me010|well okay so so the important point is not what the g.   function is.|fg|s
me010|the important point is that um there is a a a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full c. p. t.|s
me010|the full conditional probability table with some function.|s^e
me010|okay.|s^f
me010|which you choose appropriately for each case.|s
me010|so depending on what your situation is there are different functions which are most appropriate.|s
me010|and|fh
me010|so i gave uh bhaskara a copy of this uh sort of ninety two paper.|s
me012|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|and you got one robert.|s^bu
me010|i don't know who else has seen it.|s^no
me012|there's i mean|s.%--
me012|yeah.|b
me012|it's heckerman and breese.|s
me010|it's short.|s^ba
me010|it's short.|s^m^na
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me010|so um uh you have you read it yet?|qy^rt
me012|uh you can yeah you should take a look at it i guess.|s^cs
me010|okay so you should take a look.|s^bk|s^cs
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|nancy i'm sure you read it at some point in life.|s
fe004|i|%--
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|i i think so yeah.|s^na|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|and so you other guys can decide how interested|s.%--
fe004|yeah.|b.%
me010|anyway so the paper isn't isn't real hard.|fg|s^ba
mn036|okay.|s^bk
me010|and uh|fh
me010|one of the questions just come at bhaskara is how much of this does javabayes support?|qw
me012|yeah it's a good question.|s^bk|s^ba
me012|um the so what we want is basically javabayes to support deterministic uh functions.|h|s
me010|right.|s^bk
me012|and um in a sense it we can make it supported by um manually uh entering you know probabilities that are one and zeros right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me010|right so the little handout that the little thing that i sent|s^aa|s.%--
me010|i sent a message saying uh here is a way to take|s.%--:s
me010|one thing you could do which is kind of in a way stupid is take this deterministic function and use it to build the c. p. t.|s^cs
me010|so if javabayes won't do it for you.|s
mn015|huh.|b.%
me010|that you can convert all that into what the c. p. t would be.|s^e
me010|um and what i sent out about a week ago was an idea of how to do that for um evidence combination.|fh|s
me010|so one of one function that you could use as your g.   function is an evidence combining.|s^cs
me010|so you just take the uh if each of if each of the ones has its own little table like that then you could take the uh strength of each of those times its little table.|s^cs
me010|and you'd add up the total evidence for v.   e.   and a.  .|s^cs^e
me012|huh.|b
me012|i don't think you can do this.|s^nd
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me012|because g.   is a function from that to that.|s^df
me010|yep.|b
me010|right.|s^bk
me012|right?|qy^d^f^g
me012|so there's no numbers.|s
me012|there's just quadruplets of well n. duplets of uh e. v.'s.|s
me010|no no but i'm saying is there there is a|s^ar|s.%--
me010|i mean if if if you decide what's what is appropriate is probablistic evidence combination you can write a function that does it.|s
me010|it's a it's actually one of the examples he's got in there.|s^df
me010|but anyway skipping skipping the question of exactly which functions.|s
me010|now is it clear that you might like to be able to shortcut the whole conditional probability table?|qy
mn015|i mean in some it seems very plausible in some sense where we will be likely to not be observe some of the stuff.|s
mn015|because we don't have the access to the information.|s^df
me012|oops sorry.|s^fa^t1
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|that's one of the problems is is is where would where would it all come from?|qh
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|so|fh
me012|is|%--
fe004|huh.|b.%
me012|oh right.|s^bk
me012|would not be able to observe|s^m.%--
me012|what?|qw^br
mn015|if it's a a a discourse initial phrase we will have nothing in the discourse history.|s
mn015|so if if we ever want to wonder what was|s.%-
me012|oh.|b.%
me012|oh are you saying that we'll not be able to observe certain nodes?|s^bk|qy^bu^d
me012|that's fine.|s^ba
me012|that is sort of orthogonal thing.|s^df
me010|yeah so there's there's two separate things robert.|s^aa|s
me010|the the the the bayes-nets in general are quite good at saying if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that.|s
me010|okay that's what they're real good at.|s^f|s
me010|so if you don't have any information about the discourse you just use your priors of of whatever the discourse|s.%--
me010|uh|fh
me010|uh basically whatever it's probabilistically whatever it would be.|s
me010|and it's it's sort of not a great estimate.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|but it's the best one you have.|s
me010|and so forth.|s^e
me010|so that they're good at.|s
me010|but the other problem is how do you fill in all these numbers?|qh
me010|and i think that's the one he was getting at.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me012|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me012|so specifically in this case you have to have this many numbers.|s^rt
me012|whereas in this case you just have to have three for this three for this three for this right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me012|so you have to have just three n.  .|s^rt
mn015|uhhuh.|b.%
me012|so this is much smaller than that.|s
me003|asymptotically.|s^2
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me010|well pretty quickly.|s^aap
me012|right.|s^aa
me003|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe004|so you don't need data enough to cover uh nearly as much stuff.|s
me010|i mean|%--
me012|i don't know.|s^no
me003|so really what a a noisy or seems to kind of neural-net-acize these bayes-nets.|s
me010|uh|s.%--
me010|no no.|s^ar
me010|so noisy or is a funny way of referring to this.|s:s
me010|because the noisy or is only one instance.|s^df:s
me012|yeah this isn't a noisy or anymore.|fg|s:s
me010|that one actually isn't a noisy or.|s^na:s
me010|so we'll have to think of of a way|s.%-
me003|yeah.|b
me012|it's a noisy-arg-max or a noisy whatever.|s:s
me010|yeah whatever.|s^aa|s^bd
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|so uh um|fh
me003|well my point was more that we just uh|s^df.%--
me003|with the neural net right uh things come in you have a function that combines them.|s
me003|and|%-
me010|yeah it it that's true.|s^aa|s^na
me010|it is is also more neural net like although uh it isn't necessarily sum uh you know sum of weights or anything like that.|s
me003|right.|s^bk
me010|i mean you could have|s.%--
me010|uh like the noisy or function really is one that's essentially says uh take the max.|s:s
me012|well the or.|s^aap
me010|same.|s^df
me012|right i guess you're right.|s^aa|s^na
me012|yeah.|s^bk
me010|uh|fh
me010|but anyway|fg
me010|so|fh
me010|and i i think that's the standard way people get around the uh|s.%--
me010|there are a couple other ones.|s
me010|there are ways of breaking this up into to to subnets and stuff like that.|s
me010|but um|fh
me010|the|%--
me010|i think we definitely i think it's a great idea to to pursue that.|s^ba
me012|yep.|b.%
me012|so|fh
mn015|still sort of leaves one question.|s
mn015|it i mean you you can always uh see easily that that i'm not grasping everything correctly.|s
mn015|but what seemed attractive to me in uh in the last discussion we had was that we find out a means of of getting these point four point five point one of c. four.|s:s
mn015|not because you know a.   is a landmark or not but we we we label this whatever object type.|s
mn015|and if it's a garden it's point three point four point two.|s:s
mn015|if it's a castle it's point eight point one point one.|s:s
mn015|if it's uh a town hall it's point two point three point five.|s^rt:s
me010|right.|b
mn015|and so forth.|s^e
mn015|and we don't want to write this down necessarily every time for something.|s
mn015|but uh|fh
me012|it'll be students|s.%--
mn015|let's see.|s
me012|where else would it be stored?|qw
me012|that's the question.|s
mn015|well in the beginning we'll write up a flat file.|s
mn015|we know we have twenty object types.|s
me010|oh.|s^bk
me010|yeah|fg
mn015|and we'll write it down in a flat file.|s
me010|no|fg
me010|so|fg|%--
me010|well let me say something guys.|s
me010|because there's not there's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now.|s^df
me012|uhhuh.|b
me010|which is the hierarchy that comes with the ontology is just what you want for this.|s
me010|so that uh if you know about it let's say a particular town hall that it's one that is a monument then that would be stored there.|s
me010|if you don't you look up the hierarchy|s.%--
me010|uh so you you you may or so then you'd have this little vector of um you know approach mode or e. v. a mode.|s:s
me010|let's okay so we have the e. v. a vector for for various kinds of landmarks.|s:s
me010|if you know it for a specific landmark you put it there.|s
me010|if you don't you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one.|s
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|so is the idea to put it in the ontology?|qy^rt
me010|absolutely.|s^aa
me012|okay.|s^bk
me010|uh or link to.|s:s
me010|or|%--
me010|but but in any case view it logically as being in the ontology.|s
me010|it's part of what you know about a an object is its e. v. a vector.|s:s
me012|okay.|s^bk
me012|uhhuh.|b
me010|and if as i say if you know about a specific object you put it there.|s
me010|this is part of what dekai was doing.|s
me010|so when we get to wu we'll see what he says about that.|s
me012|right.|b
me010|and then if you if it isn't there it's higher.|s
me010|and if you don't know anything except that it's a it's it's a building then up at the highest thing you have the what amounts to a prior.|s
me010|if you don't know anything else about a building uh you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level.|s
me012|right.|b
me010|which might be equal or whatever it is.|s
me012|yeah.|b
me010|so that's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology.|s
me010|and it seems to me the obvious thing to do unless we find a reason to do something different.|s
me012|yeah.|b
me010|does this make sense to you?|qy^rt
me012|so|fh
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me012|so we are but we we're not doing the ontology.|s^bu
me012|so we have to get to whoever is doing the ultimately|s^bu.%-
me010|indeed.|s^aa
me012|we have to get them to|s.%-
me010|so that's another thing we're going to need to do is is to either|s.%--
me010|we're going to need some way to either get a tag in the ontology or add fields.|s
me010|or some way to associate|s.%--
me010|or it may be that all we can do is um some of our own hash tables that it|s.%--
me010|the you know there's always a way to do that.|s
me010|it's a just a question of|s.%--
me003|yeah hash on object name to you know uh the probabilities or whatever.|fg|s
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|and so|fg
me010|uh|fh
mn015|but it's uh well it strikes me as a what|s.%--
mn015|if we get the mechanism that will be sort of the wonderful part.|s
mn015|and then how to make it work is is the second part.|s
mn015|in the sense that i mean the guy who was doing the ontology uh uh apologized that it will take him another through two to three days.|s
mn015|because they're having really trouble getting the upper level straight.|s
mn015|and|%--
mn015|right now.|s^e
mn015|the reason is given the craw bet uh the the the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and on all history they're really trying to build one top level ontology that covers all the e. m. l projects.|s
mn015|and that's uh uh sort of a tough cookie.|s^ba
mn015|a little bit tougher than they figured.|s
mn015|i could have told them so.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|uh|fh
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|but nevertheless it's going to be there by by uh next monday.|s
mn015|and i will show you what's what some examples from that for towers and stuff.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|what i don't think is ever going to be in the ontology is sort of you know the likelihood of uh people entering town halls and looking at town halls and approaching town halls.|s
mn015|especially since we are dealing with a case based.|s^df
mn015|not an instance based ontology.|s^df^e
mn015|so there will be nothing on on that town hall or on the berkeley town hall or on the heidelberg town hall.|s
mn015|it'll just be information on town halls.|s
me010|well they they they how what are they going to do with instances?|qh^df
mn015|but what|%-
me010|i mean you|s.%-
mn015|well that's|s.%--
mn015|hhh.|b
mn015|that's that's different question.|s
mn015|i mean the first they had to make a design question do we take ontologies that have instances?|qh^rt
mn015|or just one that does not that just has the types?|qh^e
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and so since the decision was on types on a simply type based we now have to hook it up to instances.|s
mn015|i mean this is|s.%--
mn015|one|%-
me010|but what what is smartkom going to do about that?|qw^df
me010|because they have instances all the time.|s^df
mn015|yeah but the ontology is really not a smartkom thing.|s^aa|s
mn015|in in and of itself.|s^e
mn015|that's more something that i kicked loose in in e. m. l.|s
mn015|so it's a completely e. m. l thing.|s
me010|but uh uh smartkom's going to need an ontology.|s^df
mn015|yes a a lot of people are aware of that.|s^aa|s
me010|i understand but is anybody doing anything about it?|s^bk|qy^df
mn015|um|h
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|it's a political problem.|s
me010|we won't worry about it.|s
mn015|no but the uh i i still think that there is enough information in there.|s^ar|s
mn015|for example whether|s.%--
mn015|okay so it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world.|s
mn015|let's assume there are only twenty object types in this world.|s
mn015|and it will know if any of those have institutional meanings.|s
mn015|so in a sense i used as institutions for some in some sense or the other.|s
mn015|which makes them enterable right?|s|qy^d^f^g
mn015|in a sense.|s^e
mn015|you know.|s^f
me010|yeah.|b.%
me010|anyway so we may have to|fg|s.%--
mn015|yep.|b.%
me010|this is with the whole thing.|s
me010|we may have to build another data|s.%--
mn015|yep.|b
me010|conceptually we know what should be done.|s
me010|when we see what people have done it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just pools|s.%--
me010|like it it may be that the the instance|s.%--
me010|that we have to build our own instance uh things that with their types.|s
me012|yeah it's|fg|%--
me012|right we can just assume|s^aa|s.%-
me010|and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type.|s
me010|so we build a little data structure.|s
me010|and so what we would do in that case is in our instance gadget have our e. v. a.'s.|s
me010|and if there isn't one we'd get the type.|s
me010|and then have the e. v. a.'s for the type.|s
me010|so we'd have our own little uh e. v. a tree.|s
me012|yeah.|b
me010|and then for other uh vectors that we need.|s
me012|right.|b
me010|so we'd have our own little things so that whenever we needed one we'd just use the ontology to get the type.|s
me012|uhhuh.|b.%
me012|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|and then would hash or whatever we do to say uh!|s^fe
me010|if it's that type of thing and we want its e. v. a vector pppt-pppt it's that.|s:s^fe
me010|so i think we can handle that.|s
me010|and then but the combination functions and whether we can put those in java bayes and all that sort of stuff is uh is the bigger deal.|s
me012|yeah.|s^aa
me010|i think that's where we have to get technically clever.|s
me012|um|fh
me003|we could just steal the classes in javabayes and then interface to them with our own code.|s^cs
me010|well i ye uh yeah the|s.%-
me012|that requires understanding the classes in javabayes i guess.|s
me010|yeah i mean it's uh cute.|s^aa|s^ba
me010|i mean you've been around enough to|s.%--
me010|i mean|s.%--
me010|just.|s^rt
me003|well it depends on|s.%-
me010|i mean there's this huge package which which may or may not be consistent.|s^df
me010|and|fh
me010|you know.|s^f
me010|but yeah we could look at it.|s^aa|s^cs
me003|well i was|s^df.%--
me003|okay yeah.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|it's it|s.%--
me010|it's an sort of a kind of a it|s.%--
me010|the thing is it's kind of an interpreter.|s
me010|and it expects its data structures to be in a given form.|s
me010|and if you say hey we're going to make a different kind of data structure to stick in there|s.%-:s
me003|well no but that just means there's a protocol.|s
me003|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me003|that you could|s.%-
me010|it may or may not.|s
me010|i don't know.|s^no^rt
me010|that's the question is to what extent does it allow us to put in these g.   functions?|qh
me010|and i don't know.|s^no
me003|well no but i mean what i uh the|s^ar|s^df.%--
me003|so you could have four different bayes-nets that you're running.|s
me003|and then run your own write your own function that would take the output of those four.|s^e
me003|and make your own g.   function is what i was saying.|s^e
me010|yeah that's fine.|s^bk|s^ba
me010|if it's if it comes only at the end.|s^df
me010|but suppose you want it embedded?|qh
me003|well then you'd have to break all of your bayes-nets into smaller bayes-nets.|s
me003|with all the|s.%-
me010|oh that|%--
me010|yeah that's a truly horrible way to do it.|s^bk|s^ba
me010|one would hope|s.%-
me003|yeah but i'm just|s^bk|s^df.%-
mn015|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you bet.|s^bk|s^na
me010|but at that point you may say hey java bayes isn't the only package in town.|s:s
me010|let's see if there's another package that's uh more civilized about this.|s:s
me010|now srini is worth talking to on this.|s
me012|huh.|b.%
me010|because he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into javabayes.|s^df
me012|uh.|b
me010|but he doesn't remember at least when i talked to him he didn't remember whether it was an an easy thing a natural thing or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work.|s
me010|uh|fh
me010|but he did do it.|s^df
me012|yeah.|b.%
me012|i don't see why the uh combining functions have to be directly hacked into javabayes.|s^no
me012|i mean they're used to create tables.|s^df
me012|so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in x. m. l.|s
me010|well i say that's one way to do it is is to just convert it into a into a c. p. t that you zip.|s^na
me010|it's blown up.|s^bd
me010|and is a it's uh it's huge.|s^bd
me010|but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication.|s^df
me012|uhhuh.|b.%
me012|yeah.|b
me012|i don't think i mean the fact that it blown blows up is a huge issue in the sense that|s^nd.%--
me012|i mean okay.|s
me012|so say it blows up right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me012|so there's like the you know ten ten fifteen uh things.|s
me012|it's going to be like two to the that.|s
me012|which isn't so bad.|s
me010|i understand.|s^na
me010|i'm just saying that|s^df.%--
me010|that was that was my note.|s
me010|the little note i sent said that.|s^e
me012|uhhuh.|b
me010|it said here's the way you'd take the logical g.   function and turn it into a c. p. t.|s:s
me012|uhhuh.|b
me010|i mean that the the evidence combining function.|s
me010|so we could do that.|s^cs
me010|and maybe that's what we'll do.|s^am^cs
me010|but um|fh
me010|don't know.|s^no
me010|so i will before next week uh push push some more on on this stuff that dekai wu did.|s^cs
me010|and try to understand it.|s^e
me010|uh you'll make a couple of more copies of the heckerman paper to give to people.|s^bu
me012|sure.|s^aa
mn036|yeah i i would like a copy.|fg|s
mn036|yeah.|fh
me012|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|and um|fh
mn036|okay.|b
me010|i think|%-
mn015|okay and i'll i'll think through this uh uh getting eva vectors dynamically out of ontologies one more time.|fg|s^cc
mn015|because i i i i'm not quite sure whether we all think of the same thing or not here.|s
me010|well you and i should talk about it.|s^cs
mn015|yeah uhhuh.|s^aa
mn015|okay.|s^bk
me010|all right great.|s^bk|s^ba
me010|and robert thank you for coming in under|s^ft.%--
me010|he he's been sick.|s^df
me010|robert.|s^e
mn015|und|%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me003|i was thinking maybe we should just cough into the microphone and see if they can't see if they can handle it.|s^j
me012|yep.|s^aa
fe004|sure.|s^aa
mn015|um is this uh|fg|qy.%-
me045|as usual.|s
me003|yes.|s^aa
me003|whew!|%
me003|i almost forgot about the meeting.|s^rt
me003|i woke up twenty minutes ago thinking what did i forget.|s:qw
mn015|it's great how the brain sort of does that.|s
me045|something's not right here.|s:s
me003|internal alarms.|s
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so the news for me is a.   my forthcoming travel plans.|s^rt
mn015|in two weeks from today.|s^rt
me003|yes.|b
mn015|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|more or less.|s^rt
mn015|i'll be off to sicily and germany for a couple three days.|s^rt
me003|now what are what are you doing there?|qw
me003|i forgot.|s
mn015|okay i'm flying to sicily basically to drop off simon there with his grandparents.|s^bk|s
mn015|and then i'm flying to germany to go to a moku-treffen.|s
mn015|which is the meeting of all the module responsible people in smartkom.|s
me003|huh.|b
mn015|and represent i. c. i.|s^rt
mn015|and myself i guess there.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|that's the huh actual reason.|s
mn015|and then i'm also going up to e. m. l for a day.|s
mn015|and then i'm going to meet the very big boss wolfgang walster in saarbruecken and the system system integration people in kaiserslautern.|s
mn015|and then i'm flying back via sicily.|s
mn015|pick up my son.|s
mn015|come back here on the fourth of july.|s
mn015|and uh|fh
me045|what a great time to be coming back to the u. s. of a..|s
me003|god bless america.|s
me045|you'll see maybe see the fireworks from your plane coming in.|s^j
mn015|and i'm sure all the the people at the airport will be happy to work on that day.|s^j
me045|yeah.|s^aa^j
me045|you'll get even better service than usual.|s^j
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me003|wait aren't you flying on lufthansa though?|qy^bu^rt
mn015|alitalia.|s^ng
me003|oh well then the you know it's not a big deal.|s^bk|s^ba^rt
me003|once you get to the united states it'll be a problem.|s
me003|but|fh
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|and um|fg
mn015|that's that bit of news.|s^t^tc
mn015|and the other bit of news is we had you know uh i was visited by my german project manager.|s^rt^t^tc
mn015|who a.   did like what we did.|s^rt
mn015|what we're doing here.|s^e^rt
mn015|and b.   is planning to come here either three weeks in july or three weeks in august to actually work.|s
me003|on|qw^bu^d.%-
mn015|with us.|s
me003|oh.|s^bk
mn015|and we sat around and we talked.|s
mn015|and he came up we came up with a pretty strange idea.|s
mn015|and that's what i'm going to lay on you now.|s^t
mn015|and um maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for eva.|fh|s
mn015|because she has been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough.|s
fn050|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so this is so weird it should even make you happy.|s
fn050|uh okay.|s^bk
me045|oh great.|s^ba
mn015|imagine if you will that we have a system that does all that understanding that we want it to do based on utterances.|s
me003|uhhuh.|b
mn015|it should be possible to make that system produce questions.|s
mn015|so if you have the knowledge of how to interpret where is x.   under given conditions situational user discourse and ontological conditions you should also be able to make that same system ask where is x.  .|s:qw
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|in a certain way.|s^e
mn015|based on certain intentions.|s^e
mn015|so instead of just being able to observe phenomenon um and guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention and make it produce an utterance.|s
me045|huh.|b
me003|well like in a. i they generally do the take in.|s
me003|and then they also do the generation phase like nancy's thing.|s
me003|or uh|fh
me003|you remember in the the hand thing in one eighty two like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations.|s
me003|you mean that sort of thing?|qy^rt
mn015|absolutely.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and once you've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself.|s
mn015|and answer.|s
mn015|understand the answer.|s
mn015|ask something else.|s
mn015|and enter a dialogue with itself.|s
mn015|so the the basic the same idea as having two chess computers play against each other.|s
me045|except this smacks a little bit more of a schizophrenic computer than a. i.|s^j
mn015|yeah you if you want you can have two parallel machines um asking each other.|s^aa|s
mn015|what would that give us?|qh
mn015|would a.   be something completely weird and strange.|s
mn015|and b.   if you look at all the factors we will never observe people let's say in wheelchairs under you know in under all conditions.|s
me045|that's good.|s^ba
mn015|you know when they say x.   and there is a ride at the goal and the parking is good we can never collect enough data.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|it's it's it's not possible.|s^e
me045|right right.|s^aa
mn015|but maybe one could do some learning.|s
mn015|if you get the system to speak to itself you may find break downs and errors and you may be able to learn.|s
mn015|and make it more robust.|s
mn015|maybe learn new things.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|so there's no no end of potential things one could get out of it if that works.|s
mn015|and he would like to actually work on that with us.|s
mn015|so|fh
me003|well then he probably should be coming back a year from now.|s
mn015|yeah i|s^aap|s.%--
mn015|see the the generation bit making the system generate generate something is shouldn't be too hard.|s^ba^df
me003|well once the system understands things.|s^aap
me045|yeah no problem.|s^aa|s^ba^j
me003|i just don't think i think we're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things.|s
mn015|yeah well if we can get it to understand one thing like our where is run through we can also maybe make it say or ask where is x.   or not.|s^bk|s
me045|huh i don't know.|s^nd^no
me045|i'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on.|s^nd
me045|you know i mean just because it's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language rather than learning to understand it right?|s^df^e|qy^d^f^g
me045|i mean|%--
me045|just the fact that we'll get the point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will always know exactly when it's correct to use that construction right?|s|qy^d^f^g
mn015|it's it's uh|%--
mn015|well i've i've done generation and language production research for four four and a half years.|s
mn015|and so it's it's you're right.|s
mn015|it's not the same as the understanding.|s^e
mn015|it's in some ways easier and some ways harder nuh?|s|qy^d^f^g
me045|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|but um|fh
mn015|i think it'd be fun to look at it or into that question.|s
me045|nnn yeah.|b
mn015|it's a pretty strange idea.|s^ba
mn015|and so that's that's but|s.%-
me003|the basic idea i guess would be to give allow the system to have intentions basically.|s^bu^rt
me003|because that's basically what needs to be added to the system for it.|s^df
mn015|well look at|s.%-
mn015|eee i think even think even|s.%--
mn015|what it would be the the prior intention.|s
mn015|so let's uh uh let's say we have this|s.%-
me003|well we'd have to seed that.|s
me003|i mean|%--
mn015|no let's we have to we have some some top down processing given certain setting.|s
mn015|okay now we change nothing and just say ask something.|s:s
mn015|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|what would it ask?|qw
me003|it wouldn't know what to ask.|s
me003|i mean|%--
mn015|it|s.%-
me003|unless it was in a situation.|s
me003|we'd have to set up a situation where it didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
fn050|uhhuh.|b
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me003|which means that we'd need to set up an intention inside of the system right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|uh|%-
me003|which is basically i don't know where something is and i need to go there.|s^e:s
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|ooh do we really need to do that?|qy
mn015|because|s^df.%-
me003|well no i guess not.|s^ar|s^nd
mn015|it's i know it's it's strange.|s^ba
mn015|but look at it look at our bayes-net.|s
mn015|if we don't have let's assume we don't have any input from the language right?|s|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn015|so there's also nothing we could query the ontology.|s
mn015|but we have a certain user setting.|s
mn015|if you just ask what is the likelihood of that person wanting to enter some something it'll give you an answer.|s
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|that's just how they are.|s
me003|sure.|s^aa
mn015|and so whatever that is it's the generic default intention that it would find out.|s
mn015|which is wanting to know where something is.|s
mn015|maybe nnn and wanting|s.%--
mn015|i don't know what it's going to be.|s
mn015|but there's going to be something that|s.%-
me045|well you're not going to are you going to get a variety of intentions out of that then?|qy^bu^rt
me045|i mean you're just talking about like given this user what's the what is it what is that user most likely to want to do.|s^bu
me045|and have it talk about|s.%-
mn015|well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask what's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes.|s:qw
me045|okay.|%
mn015|you could even say let's take all the priors.|s:s
mn015|let's observe nothing and query all the posterior probabilities.|s:s
mn015|it's going to tell us something.|s
mn015|right?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|and|%-
me003|well it will assign values to all the nodes yes.|s^aap|s^aa
mn015|yes and come up with posterior probabilities for all the values of the decision nodes.|s^aa|s
mn015|which if we have an algorithm that filters out whatever the the best or the most consistent answer out of that will give us the intention ex nihilo.|s
mn015|and that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce an utterance.|s
mn015|it would be based on that extension ex nihilo.|s
mn015|which we don't know what it is.|s
mn015|but it's there.|s^rt
mn015|so we wouldn't even have to to kick start it by giving it a certain intention or observing anything on the decision node.|s
mn015|and whatever that maybe that would lead to what is the castle.|s:qw
me003|i'm just|%-
mn015|or what is that whatever.|s:qw
me003|i guess what i'm afraid of is if we don't you know set up a situation we'll just get a bunch of garbage out.|s
me003|like you know everything's exactly thirty percent.|s
mn015|no.|s^ar
fn050|huh.|%
mn015|yeah so what we actually then need to do is is write a little script that changes all the settings.|fg|s
mn015|you know goes through all the permutations.|s^e
mn015|which is we did a|s.%--
mn015|didn't we calculate that once?|qy
me003|well that was that was absurdly low in the last meeting.|s^na
mn015|it's a|s.%-
fn050|uh|%-
me003|because i went and looked at it.|s
me003|because i was thinking that could not be right.|s:s
me003|and it would it was on the order of twenty output nodes and something like twenty|s.%-
fn050|and like thirty input nodes.|s^2
me003|thirty input nodes.|s^bk^m
fn050|or some|%-
me003|so to test every output node uh would at least|s.%--
me003|let's see so it would be two to the thirty for every output node.|s^rt
me003|which is very very large.|s
mn015|oh that's|s^bk|%-
me045|oh.|s^bk
mn015|that's that's nothing for those neural guys.|s
mn015|i mean they train for millions and millions of epochs.|s
mn015|so|fh
me003|well i'm talking about|s.%--
me003|oh i was going to take a drink of my water.|s
me003|i'm talking about billions and billions and billions and|s.%--
me003|a number|s.%--
me003|two to the thirty is like|s.%--
me003|bhaskara said we had calculated out and bhaskara believes that it's larger than the number of particles in the universe.|s^rt
me003|and if|s.%--
me045|i don't know if that's right or not.|s^nd^no
me045|that's big.|s
me045|that's just that's uh it's a billion right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
me003|two to the thirty?|qy^bu^d^rt
me003|well two to the thirty is a billion.|s
me003|but if we have to do it two to the twenty times then that's a very very large number.|s
me045|right.|s^bk
me045|argh.|s
me045|oh okay.|s^bk
me045|yeah yeah that's big.|fg|s^ba
me003|because you have to query the node for every uh or query the net two to the twenty times.|s
me045|sure.|s^bk
me045|all right.|s^bk
me003|or not two to|s^bsc.%--
me003|excuse me twenty times.|s^fa|s^bsc
me045|okay so is it comes to twenty billion or something?|s^bk|qy^bu
me003|yes.|s^aa
me045|that's pretty big though.|s^ba
me003|as far as|s^e.%-
me003|that's that's big.|s^m^na
me003|actually|s.%--
me003|oh we calculated a different number before.|fg|s
me003|how did we do that?|qw
fn050|huh.|b
me045|i remember there being some other one floating around.|s
me045|but anyway uh|fh
fn050|i don't really know.|s^no
me045|yeah it's anyway the point is that given all of these different factors it's uh it's it's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever.|fg|s
fn050|ooo it's just big.|s
me045|but i mean this'll get us a bit closer at least right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me045|i mean|fh
me003|if it takes us a second to do for each one and let's say it's twenty billion then that's twenty billion seconds.|s
me003|which is|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
me003|eva do the math.|s^co
me045|long.|s^2
fn050|can't.|s^nd
me003|hours and hours and hours and hours.|s
me003|but we can do randomized testing.|s^df
me045|tah-dah!|s^ba^fe
me003|which probabilistically will be good enough.|s^e
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|yeah so it be it's an idea that one could for for example run run past um|s^bk|s.%--
mn015|what's that guy's name?|qw
mn015|you know he's usually here.|s
me045|here in the group?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|jer|s.%--
me045|jerry feldman?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|oh yeah that's the guy.|s^aa|s
mn015|we we we we|%--
me003|wait who?|s^co|qw^rt
me045|yeah that would the the bald guy.|s
me003|oh my advisor.|s^bk|s
mn015|and um|fg
mn015|so this is just an idea that's floating around.|s
mn015|and we'll see what happens.|s^rt
mn015|and um huh|fh
mn015|what other news do i have?|qw^t
mn015|well we fixed some more things from the smartkom system.|s^t^tc
mn015|but that's not really of general interest.|s^rt
mn015|um|fh
mn015|oh questions.|fg|s
mn015|yeah.|fh
mn015|i'll ask eva about the e. bayes and she's working on that.|s
mn015|how is the generation x. m. l thing?|qw
me003|i'm going to work on that today and tomorrow.|s
mn015|okay no need to do it today or tomorrow even.|s^bk|s
mn015|do it next week or|s^cs.%-
me003|i'm going to finish it today uh hopefully.|s
mn015|okay.|s^bk
me003|i want to do one of those things where i stay here.|s
me003|because uh if i go home i can't finish it.|s^df
me003|i've tried about five times so far where i work for a while and then i'm like i'm hungry.|s^df^e:s
me003|so i go home and then i think|s.%-
me045|i'm not going back.|s
me003|yeah.|s^aa
me003|either that or i think to myself i can work at home.|s:s
me003|and then i try to work at home but i fail miserably.|s
me045|yeah.|b.%
me003|like i ended up at blakes last night.|s^e
me045|non conducive.|s
me003|no.|s^aa
me003|i almost got into a brawl.|s
me003|but i did not finish the uh smartkom.|s
me003|but i've been looking into it.|s
me003|i it's not like it's a blank slate.|s
me003|i found everything that i need.|s
me003|and and uh|s.%--
mn015|but|%-
me003|at the|%--
me003|uh furthermore i told jerry that i was going to finish it before he got back.|s
me003|so|fh
mn015|okay.|s^bk
me045|that's approaching.|s
me045|he's coming back when?|qw
me045|uh next|s.%-
me003|well i think we think we'll see him definitely on tuesday for the next|s.%--
me003|or no wait.|s^co
me003|the meetings are on thursday.|s
mn015|maybe.|s^am
mn015|who knows?|qh
me003|maybe.|s^bk^m
me045|okay.|s^bk
me003|well we'll see him next week.|s
me045|all right.|s^bk
mn015|that's good.|s^ba
mn015|yeah.|fh
mn015|the paper.|s^t^tc
me045|huh.|b
mn015|huh.|b
me003|i was thinking about that.|s
me003|i think|s.%--
me003|i will try to work on the smartkom stuff.|s^rt
me003|and i'll if i can finish it today i'll help you with that tomorrow.|s^rt
me003|if you work on it.|s^rt
me003|i don't have a problem with us working on it though.|s
me003|so|fh
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so you would say it's funky.|s^bu
me003|and it|s.%-
mn015|cool.|s^bu^e
me003|i mean we just i mean it wouldn't hurt to write up a paper.|s
me003|because then i mean yeah i was talking with nancy.|s^df
me003|and nancy said you don't know whether you have a paper to write up until you write it up.|s^df^e:s
me003|so|fh
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|well|%-
me003|and since jerry's coming back we can run it by him too.|s
me003|so|fh
mn015|yep.|s^aa
mn015|um what's your input?|qw
me045|well um i don't have much experience with uh conference papers for in the computer science realm.|h|s
me045|and so when i looked at what you had which was apparently a complete submission i just sort of said|s.%--
me045|what just|%--
me045|i i didn't really know what to do with it.|s:s
me045|like this is the sort of the basic outline of the system or whatever.|s^bu
me045|or|fh
me045|or|fh
me045|here's an idea right.|s:s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
me045|that's what that paper was.|s
me045|here's here's one possible thing you could do.|s:s
mn015|uhhuh.|s^aa
me045|short.|s
me045|eight pages.|s^e
me045|and i just don't know what you have in mind for expanding.|s^no
me045|like i'd i what i didn't do is go to the web site of the conference.|s
me045|and look at what they're looking for or whatever.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|well it seems to me that um|s.%--
me003|wait is this a computer science conference?|fg|qy^rt
me003|or is it a|qrr.%-
mn015|um well it's more.|h|s^aap
mn015|it's both right?|s^e|qy^d^f^g
mn015|it's it's sort of cognitive neural psycho linguistic.|s
mn015|but all for the sake of doing computer science.|s
mn015|so it's sort of cognitive psycho neural plausibly motivated architectures of natural language processing.|s
mn015|so it seems pretty interdisciplinary.|s
mn015|and i mean the keynote speaker is tomasello.|s^rt
me045|right oh yeah.|s^bk
mn015|and blah blah blah.|s
mn015|so|fh
mn015|the the question is what could we actually do and and and keep a straight face while doing it.|s
mn015|and|s.%-
me003|well i really can't keep a straight face doing anything.|s
mn015|my idea is|s.%--
me045|setting that aside.|s
mn015|well you can say we have done a little bit.|s
mn015|and that's this.|s^rt
mn015|and uh sort of the rest is position paper.|s
mn015|we want to also do that.|s
mn015|which is not too good.|s
mn015|might be more interesting to do something like let's assume um we're right.|s
mn015|we have as jerry calls it a delusion of adequacy.|s:s
mn015|and take a where is x.   sentence.|s:qw
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and say we will just talk about this.|s
mn015|and how we cognitively neurally psycho-linguistically construction grammar ally motivated envision uh understanding that.|s
me045|huh.|b.%
mn015|so we can actually show how we parse it.|s^rt
mn015|that should be able to we should be able to come up with you know a sort of a a parse.|s
me045|right.|b
mn015|it's on.|s
mn015|just just put it on.|s^co
fe004|okay.|s^bk.%
me003|did ben harass you?|qy^rt
fe004|hi.|s.%
fe004|yes.|s^aa
me003|good.|s^ba
fe004|was he supposed to harass me?|qy^rt
me003|yes.|s^aa
fe004|well he just told me that you came looking for me.|s
mn015|you|%-
me003|oh.|s^bk
mn015|you will suffer in hell.|s^j
fe004|figure this out.|s.%
mn015|you know that.|s^j
me045|backwards.|s^t3
me045|there's a diagram somewhere which tells you how to put that|s.%-
fe004|i know.|s
fe004|i didn't understand that either.|s
mn015|this is it.|s
me003|no wait you have to put it on exactly like that.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me003|so put that those things over your ears like that.|s^rt
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|see the how the plastic things arch out like that?|qy^rt
me003|there we go.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|it hurts.|s
me003|it hurts it hurts real bad.|s^m^na|s^e^na
fe004|it does.|s^na
me045|but that's what you get for coming late to the meeting.|s
fe004|i'm sorry i didn't mean to|s^fa|s.%-
fe004|i'm sorry.|s^fa^r
fe004|i'm sorry oh these are all the same.|s^fa^r^t1|s^t1
fe004|okay this is not very on target.|fg|s
me003|is your mike on?|qy^rt
mn015|yeah it is.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|shoot.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
fe004|all right you guys can continue talking about whatever you were talking about before.|s^co
me045|um|fg
mn015|we're talking about this um alleged paper that we may just sort of|s.%-
fe004|oh which johno mentioned to me.|s^bk|s
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn015|and i just sort of brought forth the idea that we take a sentence where is the powder tower.|s:qw
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and we we pretend to parse it.|s
mn015|we pretend to understand it.|s
mn015|and we write about it.|s
me045|huh.|b.%
me045|about how all of these things|s.%-
fe004|what's the part that's not pretend?|qw
fe004|the writing?|qy^bu^d^j^rt
mn015|okay then we pretend to write about.|s^bk|s^cs^j
me045|the submitting to a major international conference yeah.|s|s^bk
fe004|which conference is it for?|qw^rt
mn015|it's the whatever architectures uh you know where|s.%--
mn015|there is this conference it's the seventh already international conference on neurally cognitively motivated architectures of natural language processing.|s
fe004|oh wow interesting.|s^bk|s^ba
mn015|and the keynote speakers are tomasello macwhinney.|fh|s^rt
mn015|macwhinney i think.|s^rt
fe004|whinney macwhinney uhhuh.|s^bc|s^aa
me045|macwhinney.|s^bc
fe004|so interesting both like child language people.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|yep.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so maybe you want to write something too.|s^rt
fe004|yeah maybe i want to go.|s^aa|s
me045|huh huh.|b
fe004|um why are they speaking at it if it|qw.%--
fe004|is is it normally like like dialogue systems or you know other n. l. p. ish things?|qy^bu
mn015|no no no no no no no no it's it's like a|s^ar|s.%-
fe004|oh it's cognitive.|fg|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn015|even neuro.|s
fe004|and|fh
fe004|uh both learning and like comprehension production that kind of stuff.|s
mn015|psycho.|s^e
mn015|you could look at the web site.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|i'll|s.%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and the and and the deadline is the fifteenth of june.|s
fe004|i don't know about it.|s^no
fe004|yeah that's pretty soon.|s^bk|s^ba
me045|huh.|b
mn015|hey plenty of time.|s^ng
me045|why we've got over a week!|s^fe^j
mn015|it would be nice to go write two papers actually.|s^cs
mn015|yeah and one one from your perspective and one from our|s.%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|i mean that's the kind of thing that maybe like um the general uh sort of like n. t. l. ish like whatever the previous simulation based maybe you're talking about the same kind of thing a general paper about the approach here would probably be appropriate.|s^cs
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|and good to do at some point anyway.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|um|fg
mn015|well i i also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months we we we could sort of craft a nice little paper that if it gets rejected which could happen doesn't hurt.|fg|s^cs
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|because it's something we uh|s^df.%-
fe004|having it is still a good thing.|s^2
mn015|having it is a good good thing.|s^m^na
fe004|yeah.|b
mn015|it's a nice exercise.|s^ba^e
mn015|it's|s.%--
mn015|i usually enjoy writing papers.|s
mn015|it's not i don't regard it as a painful thing.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh it's fun.|s^aa|s^ba
mn015|and um we should all do more for our publication lists.|s^cs
mn015|and it just never hurts.|fh|s^df
mn015|and keith and or johno will go probably.|fh|s^rt
me003|will i?|qy^rt
fe004|when is it and where?|qw
me045|huh.|b
mn015|in case of|s.%-
mn015|it's on the twenty second of september in saarbruecken germany.|s
fe004|uh it's in germany.|s^bk|s^bk^m
fe004|uh okay i i see.|s^bk
fe004|tomasello's already in germany anyway.|s^df
fe004|so makes sense okay.|s|s^bk
me045|just|%-
fe004|um okay.|fh
fe004|so is the what are you just talking about you know the details of how to do it or whether to do it or what it would be?|qr
me045|what would one possibly put in such a paper.|s
mn015|what to write about.|s
fe004|or what to write about.|s^bk^m
mn015|what is our what's our take home message.|s
mn015|what what do we actually|s.%--
mn015|because i mean it i don't like papers where you just talk about what you plan to do.|s^df
mn015|i mean it's obvious that we can't do any kind of evaluation.|s
mn015|and have no you know we can't write an a. c. l type paper where we say okay we've done this.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|and now we're whatever percentage better than everybody else you know.|s^e:s|s^f
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|it's far too early for that.|s^e
mn015|but uh we we can tell them what we think.|s^df^rt
mn015|i mean that's|s.%--
mn015|never hurts to try.|s^df
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|maybe even that's maybe the time to introduce the the new formalism that you guys have cooked up.|s^cs^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|are in the process of|s.%-
me003|but that|s.%-
fe004|how many pages?|qw
me003|don't they need to finish the formalism?|qy^bu^rt
mn015|it's just like four pages.|s
fe004|four pages?|qw^br^bu^d^m^rt
mn015|i mean it's it's not even a|s.%-
me045|yeah.|b.%
fe004|okay so it's a little thing.|s^bk|s^ba
mn015|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe004|oh.|s^bk
me003|well you said it was four thousand lines.|s^bu^rt
me045|oh.|s^bk
me003|is that what you|qy^e.%-
fe004|okay four pages is like really not very much space.|s^bk|s^ba
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
mn015|did you look at it?|qy^rt
mn015|yeah it depends on the format.|fg|s^aap
me045|oh my gosh oh i thought you were i thought we were talking about something.|s^ba|s
me045|which was much more like ten or something.|s
mn015|no that's i mean that's actually a problem.|s^ar|s
mn015|it's it's more difficult to write on four pages than on eight.|s^e
fe004|it's|%-
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|and it's also difficult to even if you had a lot of substance it's hard to demonstrate that in four pages basically.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|um|fh
me045|that would be hard.|s^ba
mn015|well i uh maybe it's just four thousand lines.|s
fe004|i mean it's still it's still|s.%-
mn015|i i don't they don't want any|s.%--
mn015|they don't have a tex style guide.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
mn015|they just want ascii.|s
mn015|pure ascii lines.|s^e
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|whatever.|s
mn015|why for whatever reason.|s
mn015|i don't know.|s
fe004|not including figures and such?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
mn015|very unspecific unfortunately.|s^ba
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|well|%-
mn015|we'll just uh|s.%--
me003|i would say that's closer to six pages actually.|s

mn015|okay then.|s^bk
me045|four thousand lines.|s^m
mn015|it's|%-
me045|i mean isn't isn't it about fifty fifty five sixty lines to a page?|fh|qy^bu
mn015|i don't quote me on this.|s^co
mn015|this is numbers i i have from looking|s^df.%-
me003|how many characters are on a line?|qw^j^rt
mn015|okay.|s^bk
fe004|ascii?|qy^bu^d^j^rt
mn015|let's let's what should we should should we uh um discuss this over tea?|qy^cs^rt

mn015|i'm wizarding today.|s^df
fe004|okay look at the web page.|s^bk|s^bu^rt
mn015|um|fh
mn015|look at the web page and let's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon.|s^m^na|s^cs^rt
fe004|more cues for us to find it are like neural|s.%-

fe004|okay.|s^bk

mn015|did you catch that allusion?|qy^rt
mn015|it's time to walk the sheep.|s^e^rt
me045|no.|s^ar
mn015|it's uh presumably one of the watergate codes they uh|s.%--

mn015|anyways|fg|%-
mn015|um um|fh
mn015|don't make any plans for spring break next year.|s^co^tc
mn015|that's|%-
me045|oh shoot.|s^ba
mn015|that's the other thing.|s
mn015|we're going to do an e. d. u internal workshop in sicily.|s
fe004|that's what that's what he says.|s
mn015|i've already got the funding.|s^df
fe004|i that's great.|s^ba
mn015|so i mean|s.%-
fe004|does that mean does that mean you'll get you'll fly us there?|qy^rt
me045|we'll see.|s
mn015|no that's|%-
mn015|yeah that's what it means.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|hhh!|%
fe004|okay cool.|s^bk|s^ba
me045|huh.|b
me003|and he'll put us up too.|s
fe004|i know i know about that part.|s
fe004|i know about the the almond trees and stuff.|s
fe004|not joking.|s^rt
mn015|okay.|s^bk.%
fe004|name a vegetable.|s^co^j
fe004|okay oh um kiwi.|fg|s^cs^j^rt
me045|yeah.|b

mn015|yeah mangos go everywhere.|s^aa|s^df
mn015|so do kiwi.|s
fe004|really?|qy^bh
fe004|oh okay but i was trying to find something that he didn't grow on his farm.|s^bk|s^df
mn015|but coconut pineapple that's that's tricky yeah.|s^ba|s^aa
fe004|sorry.|s^fa
fe004|anyway|s.%--
fe004|cantaloupe.|s^t3
me045|so but we have to decide what like sort of the general idea of|s^t^tc.%-
me003|potatoes.|s^t3
me003|so sorry.|s^fa
me045|um|fg
me045|i mean we're going to have an example case.|s
me045|um right?|fh|qy^d^f^g
me045|i the the point is to like this where is case or something.|s:qw
mn015|yeah maybe you have it would be kind of the paper would have in my vision a nice flow if we could say well here is the here is parsing if you want to do it right.|s^aa|s^cs:s
mn015|here is understanding if you want to do it right.|s^cs^e:s
mn015|and you know without going into technical|s.%-
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|but then in the end we're not doing like those things right yet right?|s^nd|qy^d^f^g
fe004|would that be clear in the paper or not?|qr
mn015|that would be clear.|s
mn015|we would|s.%--
mn015|i i mailed around a little paper that i have.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|it would be like this is the idea.|s
mn015|we could sort of say this is|s.%-
fe004|oh i didn't get that.|s
fe004|did i?|qy^rt
fe004|oops.|s^fa
mn015|no.|s^ar
fe004|did i?|qy^r^rt
fe004|oops sorry.|s^fa
me003|no i don't think you got it.|s^ar|s^nd
mn015|see this if if you're not around and don't partake in the discussions and you don't get any email.|s
fe004|i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry sorry.|s^fa
mn015|and|fh
fe004|okay go on.|s^co^t
fe004|so parsing done right is like chicken done right.|s^j^t^tc
mn015|so we could we could say this is what what's sort of state of the art today nuh?|s|qy^d^f^g^rt
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and say this is bad nuh?|s|qy^d^f^g^rt
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|and then we can say uh well what we do is this.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|yeah.|s^bk.%
fe004|parsing done right interpretation done right example.|s^bu
mn015|uhhuh yeah and|s^aa|%-
fe004|and how much to get into the cognitive neural part?|qw
me003|that's the only that's the question mark.|s
me003|don't you need to reduce it if it's a or reduce it if it's a cognitive neuro|qy^bu.%-
fe004|well you don't have|s.%--
fe004|i mean the conference may be cognitive neural.|s
fe004|doesn't mean that every paper has to be both.|s
mn015|yeah and you can you can just point to the to the literature.|s^aa|s
me045|huh.|b
fe004|like n. l. p cognitive neural.|s^e
mn015|you can say that construction based.|s.%
mn015|you know|%-
fe004|so so this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side.|s
fe004|although it could reference the n. t. l. ish sort of like um approach.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|the fact that the methods here are all compatible with or designed to be compatible with whatever neurological stuff.|s^e
mn015|uhhuh.|b.%
fe004|yeah i guess four pages you could|fg|s.%--
fe004|i mean you could definitely it's definitely possible to do it.|s.%
fe004|it's just it'd just be small.|s
fe004|like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail.|s
fe004|but you can use an example of it.|s^df
me045|well looking at|s^df.%-
me045|yeah looking at that paper that that you had i mean you know like you didn't really explain in detail what was going on in the x. m. l cases or whatever.|fg|s
me045|you just sort of said well you know here's the general idea.|s:s
me045|some stuff gets put in there.|s
me045|you know hopefully you can you can say something like constituents tells you what the construction is made out of you know without going into this intense detail.|s
fe004|yeah yeah.|b
fe004|so it be like using the formalism rather than you know introducing it per se.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|so|fh
me045|give them the one paragraph whirlwind tour of what this is for.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me045|and yeah.|fh
mn015|uhhuh.|b.%
fe004|and people will sort of figure out or ask about the bits that are implicit.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|so this will be sort of documenting what we think and documenting what we have in terms of the bayes-net stuff.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and since there's never a bad idea to document things no?|s|qy^d^g^rt
fe004|that's that's definitely a good idea.|s^na
mn015|that would be my uh|s.%--
mn015|we we should sketch out the details maybe tomorrow afternoon-ish if everyone is around.|s^cs
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
me045|i think so.|s
mn015|you probably wouldn't be part of it.|s
mn015|maybe you want|s.%--
mn015|think about it.|s^cs
mn015|um|fh
mn015|you may may ruin your career forever if you appear.|s^j
me003|yeah you might get blacklisted.|s^aa^j|s^j
mn015|and um|fg
mn015|the uh other thing|s.%--
mn015|yeah we actually have we made any progress on what we decided uh last week?|fg|qy^rt
mn015|i'm sure you read the transcript of last week's meeting in red.|s^rt
mn015|so so you're up to dated caught up.|s
fe004|no sorry.|s^ar|s^fa
mn015|we decided that we're going to take a where is something question.|s:qw
mn015|and pretend we have parsed it.|s
mn015|and see what we could possibly hope to observe on the discourse side.|s
me003|remember i came in and i started asking you about how we were going to sort out the uh decision nodes?|qy
fe004|yes.|s^aa
fe004|what'd you say?|qw
me003|i remember you talking to me just not what you said.|s:s
fe004|i do remember you talking to me.|s^na
fe004|um|fh
fe004|a few more bits.|s^cs
me003|well there was like we needed to or uh in my opinion we need to design a bayes another sub-bayes-net.|s^rt
me003|you know it was whether it was whether we would have a bayes-net on the output and on the input.|s^e^rt
fe004|oh.|b
me003|or whether the construction was going to be in the bayes-net.|s^e^rt
fe004|oh yeah okay.|s^bk
me003|and outside of it.|s
me003|and|fh
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so that was was that the question?|qw^rt
fe004|was that what|qy.%-
me003|well that was related to what we were talking about.|s
mn015|should i introduce it as sudo-square?|qy^rt
me003|yeah sure.|s^aa
mn015|we have to put this in the paper.|s^cs
mn015|if we write it.|s^e
mn015|this is this is my only constraint.|s
mn015|the|%--
mn015|so|fg
mn015|the sudo-square is situation user discourse right ontology.|s
me045|oh i saw the diagram in the office.|s
fe004|oh my god that's amazing!|s^ba^fe
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|yeah whatever.|s^bd
fe004|no way!|s^fe
me045|way.|s
mn015|is it?|qy^rt
fe004|someone's going to start making phil collins jokes.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|huh?|qw^br^rt
fe004|sorry.|s^fa
me045|oh god i hope not.|s
me003|what?|qw^br^rt
fe004|you guys are too young.|s
me045|you know like sussudio.|s
me045|that horrible horrible song that should never have been created.|s
fe004|yeah come on.|s
me003|oh oh oh oh.|s^bk
fe004|i know that was horrible.|s^na
me003|i've blocked every aspect of phil collins out of my mind.|s
fe004|sussudio.|s
fn050|what?|qw.%
fe004|i'm sorry i haven't.|s^fa
fe004|not on purpose.|s^e
me045|in here.|s.%
mn015|oh well also he's talking about suicide.|s
mn015|and that's that's not a notion i want to have evoked.|s
fe004|no he's not.|s^nd
mn015|he is.|s^nd
fe004|really?|qy^bh^rt
fe004|oops i didn't really listen to it.|s^fa|s^df
mn015|the|%--
fe004|i was too young.|s^df^e
me045|huh.|b
me045|it sounds too rocking for that.|s^j
fe004|anyway|%--
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me045|anyway so what's going on here?|fg|qw^t^tc
me045|so what are what|qw.%-
me045|was wollte der kuenstler uns damit sagen?|qw
mn015|so|fg
fe004|stop excluding me.|s^co
mn015|okay so we have tons of little things here.|s^bk|s^tc
mn015|and we've|s.%-
fe004|i can't believe that that's never been thought of before.|s
me003|wait what are the dots?|qw
me003|i don't remember what the dots were.|s^df^no
me045|those are little bugs.|s
mn015|okay.|fg
fe004|cool keith.|s
mn015|you know these are our whatever belief net decision nodes.|s
mn015|and they all contribute to these things down here.|s^rt
me003|oh oh.|b
fe004|wait wait what's the middle thing?|s^co|qw
mn015|that's e. d. u.|s
me045|that's a|s.%-
mn015|our|%-
fe004|but i mean|%-
me045|that's|%-
mn015|you.|s^e
mn015|we.|s^e
mn015|us.|s^e
fe004|but what is it?|qw
mn015|well in the moment it's a bayes-net.|s
mn015|and it has sort of fifty not yet specified interfaces.|s
mn015|okay uh i have taken care that we actually can build little interfaces to other modules that will tell us whether the user likes these things and the or these things.|fh|s
mn015|and he whether he's in a wheelchair or not.|s
fe004|okay.|b
fe004|is that supposed to be the international sign for interface?|qy^rt
mn015|i think so yeah.|s^na|s^aa
fe004|huh okay.|s^bk
me003|i'd i'd never seen it before either.|s
fe004|okay just|s.%-
fe004|cool.|s^bk
mn015|huh so|fh
me045|because things fit onto that see?|s^df|qy^d
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|cool.|s
me045|in a vaguely obscene fashion.|s^e
mn015|no this is a r. m. e core by agent design.|fg|s^rt
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
fe004|that's so great.|s^ba
mn015|there's maybe a different|s.%-
me045|so wait.|s^co
me045|what what are these letters again?|qw^rt
me045|situation user discourse and|s^e.%-
mn015|situation user ontology.|s
fe004|user?|qw^br^rt
me045|ontology.|s^bk^m
fe004|what about the utterance?|qw
mn015|that's here.|s
me045|it's|%-
fn050|discourse.|s
fe004|oh discourse.|s^bk
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me045|discourse is all things linguistic yeah.|s|s^bk
fe004|so that's not like context okay.|s|s^bk
mn015|so this this includes the the current utterance plus all the previous utterances.|s
fe004|interesting.|s^ba
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|user.|s^t1
mn015|and for example irena gurevich is going to be here uh end of july.|s
fe004|user.|s^t1
mn015|she's a new linguist working for e. m. l.|s^rt
mn015|and what she would like to do for example is great for us.|s
mn015|she would like to take the|s.%--
fn050|ouch.|s^t1
mn015|so|fh
mn015|we have discussed in terms of the eva|s.%-
fe004|grateful for us?|qw^br
mn015|uh|fh
fe004|did you just say grateful for us?|qy^e^rt
fe004|okay sorry.|s^fa
fe004|anyway|s.%--
mn015|think of back at the eva vector.|s
mn015|and johno coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the discussed the admission fee in uh previously that might be a good indication that how do i get to the castle ? actually he wants to enter.|s:qw
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|or you know how do i get to x.  .|s:qw
mn015|discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance is a good indication.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so|fh
mn015|we don't want a hard code a set of lexemes or things that person's you know sort of filter or uh search the discourse history.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so what would be kind of cool is that if we encounter concepts that are castle tower bank hotel we run it through the ontology.|s
mn015|and the ontology tells us it has um admission opening times.|s
mn015|it has admission fees.|s
mn015|it has this it has that.|s^rt
mn015|and then we we we make a thesaurus lexicon look up.|s^rt
mn015|and then search dynamically through the uh discourse history for occurrences of these things in a given window of utterances.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and that might you know give us additional input to belief a.   versus b.  .|s
mn015|or e.   versus a.  .|s^e
fe004|so it's not just a particular word's|s^bu.%--
fe004|okay so the you're looking for a few keys that you know are cues to sorry a few specific cues to some intention.|fh|s
me003|you can dynamically look up keys yeah.|s|s^aa
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me045|uh so wait so um since this since this sort of technical stuff is going over my head.|s^df
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me003|and then grep basically.|s^e
me045|the the point is that you uh that when someone's talking about a castle you know that it's the sort of thing that people are likely to want to go into?|qy^bu^d^rt
me045|or is it the fact that if there's an admission fee then one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go in?|qrr
me045|and then the idea of entering is active in the discourse or something and then.|s^bu^rt
mn015|well|%-
me045|blah blah blah.|s^e
me045|i mean|fh
mn015|the the idea is even more general.|s
mn015|the idea is to say we encounter a certain entity in a in in a utterance.|s
mn015|so let's look up everything we the ontology gives us about that entity.|s
mn015|what stuff it does what roles it has.|s
mn015|what parts whatever it has.|s
mn015|functions.|s^e
mn015|and then we look in the discourse whether any of that or any surface structure corresponding to these roles functions ah has ever occurred.|s
me045|oh okay.|b
mn015|and then the discourse history can tell us yeah or no.|s:s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and then it's up for us to decide what to do with it.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so|%-
me045|so|fg
me045|no go ahead.|s^co
mn015|so we may think that if you say um where is the theater um whether or not he has talked about tickets before then we he's probably want to go there to see something.|s:qw
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|okay.|b
mn015|or where is the opera in paris.|s:qw
mn015|yeah.|s^f
mn015|lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to look at it.|s
me045|uhhuh okay.|b
mn015|and lots of people go to attend a performance.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and the discourse can maybe tell us what's more likely if we know what to look for in previous statements.|s
mn015|and so we can hard code for opera look for tickets look for this look for that.|s^rt
me045|okay.|b
me045|okay.|b
mn015|or look for mozart look for|s.%--
mn015|but the smarter way is to go via the ontology.|s
mn015|and dynamically then look up stuff.|s
me045|okay but you're still doing look up so that when the person so the point is that when the person says where is it then you sort of say let's go back and look at other things and then decide.|s^bk|s^bu:qw
me045|rather than the other possibility which is that all through discourse as they talk about different things.|s
me045|you know like|s.%--
me045|prior to the where is it question they say you know how much does it cost to get in you know to to see a movie around here.|s:qw
me045|um where is the closest theater.|fh|s:qw
me045|the the the point is that by mentioning admission fees that just sort of stays active now.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me045|you know that becomes part of like their sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me045|and then um over in your bayes-net or whatever when when the person says where is it you've already got you know since they were talking about admission and that evokes the idea of entering um then when they go and ask where is it then you're enter node is already active.|s
me045|because that's what the person is thinking about.|s^df
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|yeah.|b
me045|i mean that's the sort of cognitive linguistic y way.|s
me045|and probably not practical.|s^bd
mn015|yeah ultimately that's also what we want to get at.|fg|s
mn015|i think that's that's the correct way.|s
mn015|so of course we have to keep memory of what was the last intention.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and how does it fit to this and what does it tell us in terms of of the the what we're examining.|s
me045|huh yeah.|b
mn015|and furthermore i mean we can idealize that you know people don't change topics.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|but they do.|s^e
mn015|but even for that there is a student of ours who's doing a dialogue act um recognition module.|s
me045|right.|s^aa
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so maybe we're even in a position where we can take your approach.|s^cs
mn015|which is of course much better as to say how how do these pieces|s.%-:qw.%-
me045|huh.|b
me045|and much harder to program.|s^2
mn015|huh?|qw^br^rt
me045|and much harder to to program.|s^r
mn015|yeah how how do these pieces fit together.|s^aa|s^e:qw
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|but okay nevertheless so these are issues.|s
mn015|but we what we actually decided last week is to and this is again for your benefit is to um pretend we have observed and parsed an utterance such as where is the powder tower.|s:qw
mn015|or where is the zoo.|s
mn015|and specify um what what we think the the output uh observe out input nodes for our bayes-nets for the sub d. for the discourse bit should be.|s
mn015|so that and i will i will then come up with the ontology side uh bits and pieces.|s
mn015|so that we can say okay we we always just look at this utterance.|s
mn015|that's the only utterance we can do.|s^rt
mn015|it's hard coded.|s
mn015|like srini sort of hand parsed.|s
mn015|hand crafted.|s^e
mn015|but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances and from ontologies.|s
mn015|and then we can sort of fiddle with these things to see what it actually produces in terms of output.|s
me045|uh.|b
mn015|so we need to find out what the where is x.   construction will give us in terms of semantics.|fg|s
mn015|and simspec type things.|s
fe004|just|%-
fe004|okay just where is x.  ?|s^bk|qy^bu^d:qw
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|or any variants of that.|s^e
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|no!|s^ar^fe
mn015|um look at it this way.|s^co
mn015|yeah.|fh
mn015|what did we decide?|qw
mn015|we decided sort of the the prototypical where is x.   where you know we don't really know does he want to go there or just want to know where it is.|s:qw
me045|well we were|s.%-
mn015|so the difference of where is the railway station versus where where where is greenland nuh.|s^e:qw|s^f
me045|uhhuh.|b
me003|uh i was just dancing sorry.|s^df|s^fa
mn015|we're not videotaping any of this.|s
mn015|so|fh
me003|uh uh.|s^bk.%
me045|so um we're supposed to|fg|s^bu.%--
me045|i mean we're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of request for location right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
me045|actually|%--
me045|or|%--
me045|i mean anyway the node in the uh the ultimate uh in in the bayes-net thing when you're done the the node that we're talking about um is one that says request for location true or something like that right?|s|qy^d^g
me045|um and and exactly how that gets activated you know like whether we want the sentence how do i get there to activate that node or not you know that's that's sort of the issue that sort of the linguistic y side has to deal with right.|s^bu:qw|qy^d^g
mn015|yeah but it|s^aa|s.%-
mn015|well actually more more the other way around.|s^ng
mn015|we wanted something that represents uncertainty uh in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is for example.|s
mn015|some generic information.|s
me045|okay.|b
mn015|and so this is prototypically found in the where is something question surface structure.|s
me045|okay.|b
mn015|which can be you know should be maps to something that activates both.|s
mn015|i mean the idea is to|s.%-
me003|i don't|s.%-
me045|all right okay.|s^bk
me003|hhh.|%
mn015|let's have it fit nicely with the paper.|s^cs
me003|i guess i don't|s.%-
me003|i don't see how we would be able to distinguish between the two intentions just from the utterance though.|s^nd^no
mn015|the|%-
me003|i mean uh or before we don't before we cranked it through the bayes-net.|s^e
me003|i mean|fh
mn015|yeah we we wouldn't.|s^aa|s^na
mn015|that's exactly what we want.|s
mn015|we want to get|s.%-
me003|we would?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|no we wouldn't.|s^ar|s^nd
me003|okay.|s^bk
me003|but then so basically it's just a for every construction we have a node in the net right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
me003|and we turn on that node.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me045|oy.|s
mn015|what what is this going to|qw.%--
mn015|exactly.|s^aa
mn015|what is the uh|qw.%--
mn015|well|fh
me003|and then given that we know that the construction has these two things we can set up probabilities.|s
me003|we can basically define all the tables for for those.|s
mn015|yeah it should be so we have|s^aa|s.%--
mn015|um|fh
mn015|let's assume we we call something like a loc x. node and a path x. node.|s:s
mn015|and what we actually get if we just look at the discourse where is x.   should activate.|s
mn015|or should|s.%--
me045|huh.|b
mn015|huh should be both.|fh|s
mn015|whereas maybe where is x.   located we find from the data is always just asked when the person wants to know where it is.|s:qw
mn015|and how do i get to is always asked when the person just wants to know how to get there.|s:qw
mn015|right?|qy^d^g
mn015|so we want to sort of come up with what gets uh input and how in case of a where is question.|s:qw
mn015|so what what would the outcome of of your parser look like?|qh
mn015|and what other discourse information from the discourse history could we hope to get squeeze out of that utterance?|qh
mn015|so define the the input into the bayes-net based on what the utterance where is x.   gives us.|s:qw
mn015|so definitely have an entity node here which is activated via the ontology.|s
mn015|so where is x.   produces something that is stands for x.   whether it's castle bank restroom toilet whatever.|s
mn015|and then the ontology will tell us|s.%-
fe004|that it has a location or something like that.|s^2^bu
fe004|or the ontology will tell us where actually it is located.|s^bu^e
mn015|no not at all.|s^ar|s^nd
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|where it is located we have a user proximity node here somewhere.|s
fe004|okay okay.|s^bk
mn015|which tells us how far the user how far away the user is in respect to that uh entity.|s^e
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so you're talking about for instance the construction obviously involves this entity or refers refers to this entity.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and from the construction also you know that it is a location.|s^bu
fe004|is or a thing thing that can be located.|s^bsc^bu
fe004|right ontology says this thing has a location slot.|s
fe004|and that's the thing that is being that is the content of the question that's being queried by one interpretation of where is x.  .|s:qw
fe004|and another one is um path from current user current location to that location.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so|fh
fe004|so is the question|qy.%--
fe004|i mean it's just that i'm not sure what the|s.%--
fe004|is the question for this particular construction how we specify that that's the information it provides?|qy
fe004|or or asked for?|qrr
fe004|both sides right?|s^e|qy^d^g
mn015|yeah you don't need to even do that.|s^ng
mn015|it's just sort of what what would be observed in uh in that case.|s
fe004|observed when you heard the speaker say where is x.   or when when that's been parsed?|qr^bu
mn015|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe004|so these little circles you have by the d.  .|s^bu^rt
fe004|is that|qy.%-
mn015|that's exactly what we're looking for.|s^na
fe004|okay okay.|s^bk
me003|i i just i don't like having characterizing the constructions with location and path.|s
me003|or characterizing them like that.|s
me003|because you don't it seems like in the general case you wouldn't know how how to characterize them.|s^df
mn015|you wouldn't.|s^na
me003|i mean or for when.|s:qw
me003|there could be an interpretation that we don't have a node for in the|s.%--
me003|i mean it just seems like has to have uh a node for the construction and then let the chips fall where they may.|s^cs
me003|versus uh saying this construction either can mean location or path.|s
me003|and in this and since since it can mean either of those things it would light both of those up.|s
mn015|it's the same.|s
me003|thoughts?|qo
me003|questions?|qo
me045|i'm thinking about it.|s
me045|um|h
mn015|it will be the same.|s^r
mn015|so i think in here we have i'll go there right.|s:s|qy^d^f^g
me003|answers?|qo
mn015|and we have our info on.|s
mn015|so in my my case this would sort of make this happy and this would make the go there happy.|s:s
mn015|what you're saying is we have a where x. question where x. node that makes both happy.|s:qw
mn015|right?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|that's what you're proposing which is in my mind.|s
mn015|just as fine.|s^ba
mn015|so if we have a construction node where is x.   it's going to both get the posterior probability that it's info on up.|s
me003|huh yeah.|b
mn015|info on is true up and that go there is true up as well.|s^e
mn015|which would be exactly analogous to what i'm proposing is this makes uh makes something here true.|s
mn015|and this makes something also something here true.|s
mn015|and this makes this true up and this makes this true up as well.|s
me045|i kind of like it better without that extra level of indirection too.|s^cs
me045|you know with with this points to this points to that and so on.|s
me045|because i don't know it|s^df.%-
mn015|yeah because we get we get tons of constructions i think.|s^aa|s^df
fe004|uh|%-
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|because you know huh people have many ways of asking for the same thing.|s^df
me003|yeah sure.|s^aa
fe004|yeah.|b.%
mn015|and|fh
fe004|so|%-
me003|i i changed my mind actually.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so i agree with that.|fg|s
fe004|i have a different kind of question.|s
fe004|might be related.|s
fe004|which is okay so implicitly everything in e. d. u we're always inferring the speaker intent right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
fe004|like what they want.|s
fe004|either the information that they want or|s.%--
fe004|it's always information that they want probably of some kind.|s^bu
fe004|right?|qy^d^g
fe004|or i i don't know.|s^no
mn015|the system doesn't massage you no no.|s^nd|s^ar
fe004|or what's something that they|s^e.%-
fe004|i i i don't|s.%--
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|let's see.|s
fe004|so i don't know if the i mean if just there's more here that's not shown that you it's already like part of the system whatever.|s^no
fe004|but where is x.   like the fact that it is you know a speech act whatever|s.%--:qw.%--
fe004|it is a question.|s
fe004|it's a question that um queries on some particular thing x.  .|s
fe004|and x.   is that location.|s
fe004|there's like a lot of structure in representing that.|s
mn015|yep yeah.|s^aa
fe004|so that seems different from just having the node location x..|s^bu
fe004|and that goes into edu right?|s|qy^d^g
mn015|yeah precisely.|s^aa
mn015|that's that's|%-
mn015|so|%-
fe004|so is that what you're talking about?|qy
mn015|exactly we have we have specified two.|s^aa|s
fe004|what kinds of structure we want.|s^e
mn015|okay the next one would be here just for mood.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|the next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh|s.%--
mn015|i don't know maybe we want to observe the uh um uh the length of of the words used and or the prosody.|s^rt
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|and and make conclusions about the user's intelligence.|s
fe004|okay so in some ways|s^bk|s.%-
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|um so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of more linguistic meetings we've been talking about possible semantics of some construction.|fg|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|right?|qy^d^f^g
fe004|where it was|%--
fe004|the simulation that's according to it you know that that corresponds to it and as well the as discourse.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|whatever discourse information.|s
fe004|such as the mood.|s
fe004|and you know other stuff.|s
fe004|so are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that that's tailored to this problem?|qy^rt
fe004|because that that has you know basically you know it's in progress still.|s^df
fe004|it's in development still.|s^df^e
fe004|but it definitely has various feature slots attributes um bindings between things.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|that's exactly um why i'm proposing it's too early to have to think of them of all of these discourse things that one could possibly observe.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn015|so let's just assume|s.%-
fe004|for the subset of|s.%-
mn015|human beings are not allowed to ask anything but where is x.  .|s:qw
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|this is the only utterance in the world.|s
mn015|what could we observe from that?|qh
fe004|okay that exactly where is x.  .|s^bk|s^bu:qw
mn015|in|%-
fe004|not the the choices of where is x.   or how do i get to x.  .|s^bu^e
fe004|just where is x.  .|s^bu
me045|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|just just where is x.  .|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and but you know do it do it in such a way that we know that people can also say is the town hall in front of the bank that we need something like a w. h focus nuh.|s:qy|qy^d^f^g
mn015|should be should be there that you know this the whatever we get from the|s.%-
fe004|wait so do or do not take other kinds of constructions into account?|qr
mn015|well if you if you can oh definitely do.|s
fe004|okay where possible.|s^bk|s
mn015|where possible right?|s^m^na|qy^d^f^g
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|if if if it's not at all triggered by our thing then it's irrelevant.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment.|s
mn015|um but|fh
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|um it seems like for instance where is x.   the fact that it might mean um tell me how to get to x.|s.%--
fe004|like|fh
fe004|do so would you want to say that those two are both like|qy.%--
fe004|those are the two interpretations right.|s|s^f
fe004|the the ones that are location or path.|s^e
fe004|so you could say that the construction is a question asking about this location.|s
fe004|and then you can additionally infer if they're asking about the location it's because they want to go to that place.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|in which case the you're jumping a step step and saying oh i know where it is.|s:s
me045|yeah.|b.%
fe004|but i also know how to get they want to seem they seem to want to get there so i'm going to tell them.|s:s
fe004|so there's like structure|s.%-
me045|right this it's not it's not that this is sort of like semantically ambiguous between these two.|fg|s
fe004|do you sort of uh that|%-
mn015|uhhuh.|b.%
me045|it's really about this.|s
me045|but why would you care about this?|qh
me045|well it's because you also want to know this or something like that right.|s|s^f
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so it's like you infer the speaker intent.|s
fe004|and then infer a plan a larger plan from that for which you have the additional information.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|you're just being extra helpful.|s^e
mn015|yep.|s^aa
fe004|um|fh
mn015|think uh well this is just a mental exercise.|s^bd
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|if you think about|s.%--
mn015|focus on this question how would you design that.|s^cs:qw
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|is it do you feel confident about saying this is part of the language already to to detect those plans?|qy
mn015|and why would anyone care about location?|qh
mn015|if not you know|s.%--
me045|huh.|b
mn015|and so forth.|s
mn015|or do you actually|qrr.%--
mn015|i mean this is perfectly legitimate.|s
mn015|and i i would not have any problems with erasing this.|s
mn015|and say that's all we can activate based on the utterance out of context.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and just by an additional link.|s
fe004|oh.|s^bk
mn015|what?|qw
me045|right.|s^bk
fe004|right.|b
mn015|and then the the the miracle that we get out the intention go there happens based on what we know about that entity about the user about his various beliefs goals desires blah blah blah.|s:s
fe004|like|%-
fe004|with context and enough user information.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|absolutely fine.|s
mn015|but this is the sort of thing i i propose that we think about.|s
fe004|okay.|b
mn015|so that we actually end up with um um nodes for the discourse and ontology.|s^df
mn015|so that we can put them into our bayes-net.|s
mn015|never change them.|s
mn015|so we all there is is where is x.  .|s:qw
mn015|and eva can play around with the observed things.|s
mn015|and we can run our better javabayes and have it produce some output.|s
mn015|and for the first time in in in the world we look at our output.|s^rt
mn015|and um and see uh whether it it's any good.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|i mean|fh
me045|here's hoping.|s
mn015|huh?|qw^br
me045|here's hoping right.|s^r|s^f
me045|now cross your fingers.|s^e
mn015|yeah i i mean for me this is just a matter of curiosity.|s^bk|s^df
mn015|i want to would like to look at uh what this ad hoc process of designing a belief net would actually produce.|s
me045|yeah yeah.|b
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|if if we ask it where is something.|s^e:qw
mn015|and maybe it also enables you to think about certain things more specifically.|s
mn015|um come up with interesting questions to which you can find interesting answers.|s^rt
mn015|and additionally it might fit in really nicely with the paper.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|because if if if we want an example for the paper i suggest there it is.|s^df
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|so this might be a nice opening paragraph for the paper as saying you know people look at kinds of at ambiguities.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|in the literature there's bank.|s
mn015|and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and we can say well that's all nonsense.|s:s
mn015|a.   uh these things are never really ambiguous in discourse.|s
mn015|b.   don't ever occur really in discourse.|s
mn015|but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous such as where is the blah blah actually are terribly complex and completely ambiguous.|s:qw
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and so what everybody else has been doing so far in in in you know has been completely nonsensical and can all go into the wastepaper bin.|s
mn015|and the only|s.%-
me045|that's always a good way to begin yeah yeah.|s^j^na|s^aa^j
mn015|yeah.|fg
mn015|and the the the only|s.%-
me003|i am great.|s^j
mn015|yeah.|b.%
me045|all others are useless.|s^2^j
mn015|yeah.|b
me045|that's good.|s^ba.%
mn015|nice overture.|s^ba
mn015|but you know just not really.|s
mn015|okay i'm exaggerating.|s^bk|s^bd
mn015|but that might be you know saying hey you know some stuff is is actually complex if you look at it in in in the vacuum.|s^df
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and and ceases to be complex in reality.|s
mn015|and some stuff that's as that's absolutely straightforward in the vacuum is actually terribly complex in reality.|s
mn015|would be nice sort of uh also nice um up linguistics um type message.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|true.|s^aa
mn015|versus the old top down school.|s
mn015|i'm running out of time.|s^tc
mn015|okay.|fg
me003|when do you need to start wizarding?|qw^rt
mn015|at four ten.|s
mn015|okay this is the other bit of news.|s^t^tc
mn015|the subjects today know fey.|s
mn015|so she can't be here and do the wizarding.|s
me045|huh.|b
mn015|so i'm going to do the wizarding.|s
mn015|and thilo's going to do the instructing.|s
me003|huh.|b
mn015|also we're getting a a person who just got fired uh from her job.|s
mn015|uh a person from oakland who is interested in maybe continuing the wizard bit once fey leaves in august.|s
mn015|and um she's going to look at it today.|s
mn015|which is good news in the sense that if we want to continue after the after july we can.|s
mn015|we could.|s^bsc
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|and that's also maybe interesting for keith and whoever if you want to get some more stuff into the data collection.|s
mn015|remember this we can completely change the set-up any time we want.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|look at the results we've gotten so far for the first whatever fifty some subjects.|s
fe004|fifty?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|you've had fifty so far?|qy^bu^d^e^rt
fe004|or|qrr.%-
mn015|no we're approaching twenty now.|s^ar|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|but until fey is leaving we surely will hit the some of the higher numbers.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|so that's cool.|s
mn015|can do more funky stuff.|s
me045|sure.|s^bk.%
me045|yeah i'll have to look more into that data.|fg|s
me045|is that around?|qy
me045|like because that's pretty much getting posted or something right away when you get it.|s^bu^rt
me045|or|qrr.%--
mn015|um|h
me045|i guess it has to be transcribed huh?|s|qy^d^g
mn015|we have uh uh found someone here who's hand hand transcribing the first twelve.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|first dozen subjects.|s^e^rt
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|just so we can build a a language model for the recognizer.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|but um so those should be available soon.|fh|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|the first twelve.|s
mn015|and|fh
mn015|i can|%-
me045|you know|fg
me045|i mean you know that i that i looked at the first the first one and got enough data to keep me going for you know probably most of july.|s
me045|so but um|fh
me045|yeah probably not the right way to do it actually.|fg|s
mn015|but you can listen to|s.%-
mn015|you can listen to all of them from your solaris box.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|if you want.|s
me045|right.|b
mn015|it's always fun.|s^ba
fe004|sorry.|z
fe004|mental mental palm pilot.|z
fe004|right.|z
fe004|hence no problem.|z
fn050|let's see.|z
fn050|so what?|z
fn050|i'm supposed to be on channel five?|z
fn050|her nope.|z
fn050|doesn't seem to be.|z
fn050|yeah.|z
fe004|hello i'm channel one.|z
mn015|what does your thing say on the back?|z
fn050|nnn five.|z
me003|testing.|z
fn050|all right i'm five.|z
me003|sibilance.|z
me003|sibilance . three three.|z
me003|i am three.|z
fe004|uh.|z
me003|see that matches the seat up there.|z
fn050|yeah well i guess it's coming up then or|z
me003|so|fh
me003|because it's that starts counting from zero.|z
me003|and these start counting from one.|z
me003|ergo the classic off by one error.|z
fe004|but mine is correct.|z
me003|is it?|z
mn015|no.|z
fe004|it's one.|z
fe004|channel one.|z
mn015|look at the back.|z
me003|your mike number is what we're|z
fe004|oh oh oh!|z
fe004|oh.|z
me003|ho!|z
fe004|so|z
me003|i've bested you again nancy.|z
fe004|but your|z
fe004|no but the paper's correct.|z
me003|the paper is correct.|z
fe004|look at the paper.|z
me003|i didn't i was saying the microphone not the paper.|z
me010|nnn|z
me010|it's|z
fe004|oh.|z
me010|it's always offset yeah.|z
fe004|okay.|z
fe004|yes you've bested me again.|z
fe004|that's how i think of our continuing interaction.|z
fe004|damn!|z
fe004|foiled again!|z
me003|so is keith showing up?|fg|qy^rt
me003|he's talking with george right now.|s
me003|uh is he going to get a rip uh rip himself away from from that?|qy
me010|what?|qw
fe004|he'll probably come later.|s
me010|he's|%
me010|probably not is my guess.|s^nd
me003|oh then it's just going to be the five of us?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|well he he was very affirmative in his way of saying he will be here at four.|s
me010|yeah.|s^aa.%
mn015|but you know that was before he knew about that george lecture probably.|s
me010|right.|b
me010|this this is not it's not bad for the project if keith is talking to george.|s
me010|okay so my suggestion is we just|fh|s.%-
fe004|forge ahead.|s^2
me010|forge ahead yeah.|s^m^na|s^aa
mn015|cool.|s^bk.%
fe004|are you in charge?|qy^rt
mn015|sure.|s^aa
mn015|um|fh
mn015|well i sort of had informal talks with most of you.|s
mn015|so eva just reported she's really happy about the c. b. t.'s being in the same order in the x. m. l.|s
mn015|as in the um java declaration format.|s^rt
fn050|yeah.|b
fn050|the|%-
mn015|so you don't have to do too much in the style sheet transversion.|s^rt
fn050|uh yeah.|s^aa
fn050|yeah so|fg
mn015|the uh java the embedded bayes wants to take input uh uh a bayes-net in in some java notation.|s
mn015|and eva is using the xalan style sheet processor to convert the x. m. l that's output by the java bayes for the into the uh e. bayes input.|s
me003|huh.|b
fn050|actually maybe i could try like emailing the guy.|s
fn050|and see if he has something already.|s
me010|sure.|s^aa
mn015|huh.|b
fn050|that'd be weird that he has both the java bayes and the embedded bayes in|s.%--
fn050|yeah.|s^bk
me003|but that's some sort of conversion program?|qy^bu^d^rt
fn050|yeah.|s^aa
fn050|and put them into different formats.|s
fn050|oh|%-
fn050|yep he could do that too.|s^aa|s^na
me003|i think you should demand things from him.|s^cs
me010|he charges so much right?|s^ba^j|qy^bu^d^j
me003|yeah.|s^aa^j
me010|no i think it's a good idea that you may as well ask sure.|s^bd|s^bk
fn050|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|and um well pretty pretty much on on the top of my list i would have asked keith how the where is x.   hand parse is standing.|fg|s^t:qw
mn015|um but we'll skip that.|fh|s^rt
mn015|uh there's good news from johno.|s^rt
mn015|the generation templates are done.|s^rt
me003|so the trees for|s.%--
me003|the x. m. l trees for the for the for the synthesizer are written.|s
me003|so i just need to do the uh write a new set of tree combining rules.|s^rt
me003|but i think those will be pretty similar to the old ones.|s
me003|so|fh
me003|just going to be you know|s.%-
me010|oh.|s^bk
me010|you were going to send me a note about hiring|s.%--
mn015|yes.|s^aa
me010|i didn't finish the sentence.|s
me010|but he understood it.|s
me003|i know what he's talking about.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|but nancy doesn't.|s
fe004|hiring somebody.|s
me003|the guy.|s
mn015|okay so natural language generation produces not a just a surface string that is fed into a text to speech but a surface string with a syntax tree that's fed into a concept to speech.|fg|s
me010|no.|s^ar
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|now and this concept to speech module has certain rules on how if you get the following syntactic structure how to map this onto prosodic rules.|s
fe004|better.|s^ba^t1
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|sure.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite uh the german uh syntax-to-prosody rules.|s
fe004|i didn't know she spoke german.|s^no
mn015|no she doesn't.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|oh okay.|s^bk
mn015|but she speaks english.|s
fe004|oh rewrite the german ones into english.|s^bk|s
mn015|into english.|s^m^na
fe004|okay got it.|s^bk
mn015|and um therefore the|fh|s.%--
mn015|uh|fh
mn015|if it's okay that we give her a couple of more hours per week then she'll do that.|s
fe004|okay got it.|s^bk
me003|what language is that written|qw.%--
me003|is that that scheme thing that you showed me?|qy^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|that's the lisp type scheme.|s^e^na
me003|she knows how to program in scheme.|s^bu^rt
me003|i hope.|s^e^rt
mn015|no i.|s^ar|%
mn015|my guess is i i asked for a commented version of that file.|s^rt
mn015|if we get that then it's doable.|s^na
mn015|even without getting into it even though the scheme uh stuff is really well documented in the festival.|s
me003|well i guess if you're not used to functional programming scheme can be completely incomprehensible.|s^ng^rt
me003|because there's no|s^df.%--
me003|like there's lots of unnamed functions.|s^df
me010|syntax.|s^2.%
me010|yeah.|b
me003|and|fh
me003|you know.|s^f
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|anyway it we'll sort this out.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|but anyway send me the note.|s^co
me010|and then i'll check with uh morgan on the money.|s^cc
me010|i i don't anticipate any problem.|s
me010|but we have to ask.|s^df
me010|oh so this was you know on the generation thing|fg|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|if she's really going to do that then we should be able to get prosody as well.|s
me010|so it'll say it's nonsense with perfect intonation.|s
me003|are we going to can we change the voice of the of the thing?|qy^rt
me003|because right now the voice sounds like a murderer.|s
mn015|yep we we have to change the voice.|s^aa|s
fe004|which one?|qw
me003|the the little smarticus.|s
me003|smarticus sounds like a murderer.|s^e
fe004|oh.|s^bk
me045|that's good to know.|s
me003|i have your reservations.|s^j:s
me045|but i will not give them to you unless you come into my lair.|s^2
mn015|it is uh we have the choice between the uh usual festival voices.|s
mn015|which i already told the smartkom people we aren't going to use because they're really bad.|s
fe004|festival?|qw^br^d^rt
me010|it's the name of some program.|s
me010|the the synthesizer.|s^e
fe004|oh oh got it okay.|s^bk
mn015|but um|fh
me045|you know the usual party voices.|s^j
fe004|yeah i know.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|that doesn't sound exactly right either.|s
mn015|o. g. i has uh crafted a couple of diphone type voices that are really nice.|s
mn015|and we're going to use that.|s
mn015|we can still um agree on a gender if we want.|s
mn015|so we still have male or female.|s
fe004|i think|s.%-
fe004|well let's just pick whatever sounds best.|s^cs
mn015|huh?|qw^br^rt
fe004|whatever sounds best.|s^r
mn015|uh|%
me003|does o. g. i stand for original german institute?|qy^rt
fe004|unfortunately probably male voices a bit more research on.|s
fe004|so|fh
mn015|oregon.|s^ng
me010|oregon graduate institute.|s
mn015|try oregon.|s^cs^ng
me003|oh.|s^bk
fe004|oregon graduate|s^ng.%--
me003|uh.|s^bk
me010|it turns out there's the longstanding links with these guys in the speech group.|s
fe004|huh!|b
me010|very long.|s^e
me003|huh!|b
mn015|huh.|b
me010|in fact there's this guy who's basically got a joint appointment.|s
me010|hynek hermansky.|s
me010|spends a fair amount of time here.|s
me010|anyway|fg
me010|leave it.|s^co^t1
me010|won't be a problem.|s^ba^bd
mn015|okay.|fg
mn015|and it's probably also absolutely uninteresting for all of you to um learn that as of twenty minutes ago david and i per accident uh managed to get the whole smartkom system running on the uh icsi linux machines with the icsi n. t machines.|s^t^tc
mn015|thereby increasing the number of running smartkom systems in this house from one on my laptop to three.|s
fe004|huh that's good.|%
me003|how was this by accident?|qw^rt
fe004|yeah i know.|s^aa
fe004|that's the part i didn't understand.|s^no
mn015|um i suggested to try something that was really kind of.|fh|s
mn015|even though against better knowledge shouldn't have worked.|s
mn015|but it worked.|s
fe004|huh!|b
mn015|intuition.|s^j
mn015|maybe maybe maybe a bit for the a. i intuition thing.|s^e^j
fe004|will it work again?|qy^rt
me045|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|or|qrr.%--
me003|yeah.|s^bk^j
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and um we'll never found out why.|fh|s^no
mn015|it's just like why why the generation the presentation manager is now working.|s^rt
me045|huh!|b
mn015|which|%-
me045|this is something you you get used to as a programmer right?|s|qy^d^f^g^rt
me045|you know and it's cool it works out that way.|s^f|s
mn015|so the the people at saarbruecken and i decided not to touch it ever again.|fh|s
mn015|yeah that would work.|fh|s
mn015|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn015|um i was going to ask you where something is.|fh|s^t
mn015|and what we know about that.|s^e^rt
me045|where|s^bk^m.%--
fe004|where the where is construction is.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|where is x.  ?|qh^e
me045|what what thing is this?|qw
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|oh!|s^fe
mn015|but by uh we can ask uh did you get to read all four hundred words.|s^rt:qy^rt
mn015|was it okay?|qy
me010|i did.|s^na
mn015|was it|qy.%-
me003|i i i was looking at it.|s
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me003|it doesn't follow logically.|s
me003|it doesn't the first paragraph doesn't seem to have any link to the second paragraph.|s^e
me045|and so on.|s^2
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|that|%
me010|yeah.|b
me003|yeah.|b
me010|you know yeah it|s.%-
me003|each paragraph is good though.|s^ba^j
me003|i|%-
me010|yeah well it's fine.|s^bk|s^ba
me045|it was written by committee.|s
me010|anyway|fg
me010|um|fh
me010|but the meeting looks like it's it's going to be good.|s
me010|so|fh
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|i think it's uh|s.%-
fe004|yeah i didn't know about it until robert told me like|fg|s.%-
me010|yeah i i i ran across it in i don't even know where.|fg|s
me010|you know some just some weird place.|s^e
me010|and uh yeah i'm surprised i didn't know about it.|fh|s
fe004|yeah well yeah i was like why didn't dan tell me.|fg|s:qw
me010|since we know all the invited speakers.|s
me010|right or|s^aa|s.%--
me045|right.|s^aa
me010|anyway.|fh
me010|so but anyway|fh
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|so i i did see that.|s
me010|oh yeah before we get started on this|s.%--
me010|so i also had a nice email correspondence with daphne kohler who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the um you know using these structured belief nets and stuff.|s
me010|but starting in august.|s
me010|that she's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in august.|s^e
me010|and then we'll figure out a way for you uh you to get seriously connected with um their group.|s
me010|so|fh
me010|that's uh looks pretty good.|s
me010|and um|fh
me010|yeah i'll say it now.|s
me010|so um|fh
me010|and it looks to me like we're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard.|s
me010|we've been so far working on things that are easy.|s
me045|oh!|s^bk^fe
me010|uh which is mental spaces and uh and or|fh|s.%-
me045|huh!|b
fe004|it's hard.|s^ba
me010|huh?|qw^br
fe004|yeah it's hard.|s^r
me010|it's a hard puzzle.|s^na
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me045|yeah.|b
me010|but the other part of it is the way they connect to these uh probabilistic relational models.|s
me010|so there's all the problems that the linguists know about about mental spaces and the cognitive linguists know about.|s
me010|but then there's this problem of the belief net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief nets.|s
me010|uh which they call dynamic|s.%--
me010|they incorrectly call dynamic belief nets.|s
fe004|huh.|b
me010|so there's a term dynamic belief net doesn't mean that.|s
me010|it means time slices.|s
me010|and srini used those and people use them.|s
me010|uh but|fh
me010|one of the things i would like to do over the next uh month it may take more is to understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds|s.%--
me010|and|fh
me010|uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be but also what that would translate into in terms of belief net and the inferences.|s
me010|so the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models they're set up in principle so that you can make new instances.|s
me010|and instances connect to each other and all that sort of stuff.|s
me010|so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate uh belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate.|s
me010|but that's that's as far as i can tell it's it's putting together two real hard problems.|s
me010|one is the linguistic part of what are the couplings.|s
me010|and and when you have a certain uh construction that implies certain couplings and other couplings.|s
me010|you know between let's say between the past and the present.|s^f|s
me010|or any other one of these things.|s
me010|and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief net work.|s
me010|if it's got um let's say one in in you know different tenses.|s
me010|or my beliefs and your beliefs.|s
me010|or any of these other ones of of multiple models.|s
me010|so um|fh
me010|you know in the long run we need to solve both of those.|s
me010|and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both uh in a way that you know|s.%--
me010|hopefully turns out to be consistent.|s
me010|so that the|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|and sometimes it's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|because they constrain each other.|s^df
me010|i mean if you've got huge huge range of possible choices|s^df^e.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|we'll see.|s
me010|but anyway so that's um|fg|s.%--
me045|oh yeah like uh i solved the the problem of um we were talking about how do you|fg|s.%--
me045|various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote count as a noun phrase.|s
me045|you know occur as an argument of a higher construction but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way.|s
me010|right.|b
me045|um|fh
me045|and it would take a really long time to explain it now.|s
me045|but i'm about to write it up this evening.|s
me045|i solved that at the same time as how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase to get something like i the kicked dog.|s:s
me045|um|fh
me010|that's great.|s^ba
me045|did it did it at once.|s
me045|so maybe maybe it'll be a similar thing.|s
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|cool.|s^ba
me010|no i know i i think that is going to be sort of the key to this to the big project of the summer of of getting the constructions right.|s
me010|is that people do manage to do this.|s
me010|so there probably are some uh relatively clean rules.|s
me010|they're just not context free trees.|s
me045|right.|b
me010|and if we if the formalism is is good then we should be able to have you know sort of moderate scale thing.|s
me010|and that by the way is is keith what i encouraged george to be talking with you about.|s
me010|not the formalism yet.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|but the phenomena.|s
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me010|the|%--
me010|and|fh
me010|oh another thing|fg|s^tc.%--
me010|um|fh
me010|there was this uh thing that nancy agreed to in a in a weak moment this morning that.|s
me045|huh.|b
fe004|i was really strong.|s
me045|huh.|b
fn050|huh.|b
me010|uh sorry in a in a friendly moment.|s^fa|s^bsc
me045|same thing.|s^j
me010|anyway uh that we were that we're going to try to get a uh first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week.|fh|s
me010|okay.|s^f
me045|all right.|s^bk
me010|probably skipping the mental spaces part.|s
fe004|seems|%-
me045|right i do.|fg|s
me010|uh just trying to write up essentially what what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at.|fh|s
me010|we've talked about it but only the innermost inner group currently uh|s.%-
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|knows.|s^2
me010|knows uh|s^m^na|%-
me045|okay.|b
fe004|yeah and and not even all of them really do.|fg|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|but like|%--
me010|right.|s^aa
me045|there's the group as a whole knows.|s
me045|but no individual member|s.%--
me010|well that that yeah there's one of the advantages of a document right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|is is that it actually transfers from head to head.|s^e
fe004|right.|b
me010|so anyway.|fg
me045|okay.|b
me010|so um|fh
fe004|uh communication.|s
me010|huh?|qw^br
fe004|communication.|s^r
me010|communication documentation and stuff.|s^aap
me045|huh.|b
me010|anyway so uh with a little luck|s.%--
me010|uh let's let's have that as a goal anyway.|fh|s^cs
me010|and|%-
me045|so uh what was the date there?|qw
me045|monday?|qy^bu^d^rt
me045|or|qrr.%--
me010|no no no.|s^ar
me045|it's a friday.|s
me010|no uh we're talking about a week end of next week.|s
fe004|but uh but but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before|s.%--
me045|end of next week.|s^bk^m
me045|i thought you said beginning of|s.%-
fe004|i mean|%--
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|anyway let's talk separately about how|s^cs.%-
me045|yeah i have a busy weekend.|s
me045|but after that yeah.|s
me045|gung ho.|s
me010|okay yeah so so sometime next week.|s^bk|s^cs
me045|great.|s^ba^bk
me010|now if it turns out that that effort leads us into some big hole that's fine.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|you know if you say we're we're dump dump dump.|s^e:s
me010|there's a really hard problem.|s^e:s
me010|we haven't solved yet.|s^e:s
me010|that that's just fine.|s^e
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|but at at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now.|s
me010|right if to the extent that we have it let's write it.|s^aa|s^cs
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|and to the extent we don't let's find out what we need to do.|s^cs
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|so uh|fh
mn015|can we is it worth thinking of an example out of our tourism thing domain that involves a a a decent mental space shift or setting up?|qy
me010|i think it is.|s^na
me010|but uh but i interrupted before keith got to tell us what happened with where is the powder tower or whatever.|s:qw
fe004|right.|b
me045|well uh what was supposed to happen?|h|qh
me045|i've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones.|s
me045|so um you know i don't have a write up of or i haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about.|s
mn015|huh yeah i think i think we already came to the conclusion that we have two alternative paths that we two alternative ways of representing it.|fg|s
me045|which were|s.%-
mn015|one is sort of a has a|s.%--
mn015|um|fh
me045|it's gone.|s
mn015|um|fh
me045|the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic.|s
fe004|one of them was|s.%-
fe004|right.|s^aa
mn015|or comes|s.%--
fe004|right.|s^aa
mn015|is resolved later.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me045|i think it has to be the the second case.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me045|um so did you is it clear what we're talking about here?|fg|qy
fe004|i agree.|s^aa
me010|uh|h
me045|the question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path.|s
mn015|it's|%-
fe004|so you might be yeah and asking for directions.|s
me045|um|fh
mn015|should we have a a a|qy.%-
me045|or or whether the construction semantically uh is clearly only asking for location.|s
fe004|uh|%-
me045|but pragmatically that's construed as meaning tell me how to get there.|s:s
me010|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so assume these are two uh nodes we can observe in the bayes-net.|s^bu
me010|yep.|s^aa
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|b
mn015|so these are either true or false.|s
mn015|and it's also just true or false.|s
mn015|if we encounter a phrase such as where is x.   should that set this to true and this to true?|qy:qw
mn015|and the bayes-net figures out which under the situation in general is more likely.|s^e
mn015|um or should it just activate this have this be false?|qrr
mn015|and the bayes-net figures out whether this actually now means|s^e.%-
me010|uh that's a|s.%--
me010|okay so that's a that's a separate issue.|fh|s
fe004|slightly different.|s^2
me045|okay.|b
me010|so i i i i agree with you that um it's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every uh pragmatic reading.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|although there are some that will need to be there.|s
fe004|good.|b.%
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|right.|s^aa
fe004|right.|s^aa
me010|i mean there's some that|s^e.%-
fe004|or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one.|s^e
me010|you can't do that either.|s^nd
me010|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|right.|s^aa
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|but you know um almost certainly can you pass the salt is a construction worth noting that there is this this this this uh|s.%-:s.%-
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|request.|s^2
me045|uhhuh yeah.|b
fe004|very yeah.|s
me045|so right this one is maybe in the gray area.|fg|s
me045|is it is it like that or is it just sort of obvious from world knowledge that no one you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever?|qrr
fe004|huh.|b
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|one|%
mn015|or in some cases it's it's quite definitely.|s
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|so that you just know want to know where it is.|s
me045|yeah.|fg
me045|well the question is basically is this conventional or conversational implicature.|s
me010|exactly yeah.|s^aa
fe004|might be yeah.|s^am
me010|and i guess see the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in|s.%--
me010|in the short run it's more important to know how we would treat technically what we would do if we decided a.   and what we would do if we decided b.   than it is to decide a.   or b.   right now.|s
fe004|right.|s^bk
me045|okay right.|s^bk
fe004|right.|b
fe004|which one it is.|s^2
me045|which of that is yeah okay.|s^2|s^bk
mn015|huh.|b
fe004|because there will be other examples that are one way or the other right.|s|s^bk
me010|we know for sure that we have to be able to do both.|s^df
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so i guess in the short run let's let's be real clear on what the two alternatives would be.|s^cs
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and then we had another idea floating around um which we wanted to uh get your input on.|s
mn015|and that concerns the|s.%--
mn015|but the nice thing is we would have a person that would like to work on it.|s
mn015|and that's irina gurevich from e. m. l who is going to be visiting us uh the week before uh august.|s
mn015|and a little bit into august.|s
mn015|and she would like to apply the ontology that is um being crafted at e. m. l.|s
mn015|that's not the one i sent you.|s
mn015|the one i sent you was from g. m. d out of a european crumpet.|s
me010|it was terrible.|s^ba
mn015|agreed.|s^aa
mn015|um and one of the one of the those ideas was|fg|s.%--
mn015|so|fh
mn015|back to the old johno observation that if if you have a dialogue history and it said the word admission fee was uh mentioned um it's more likely that the person actually wants to enter than just take a picture of it.|s:s
mn015|from the outside.|s^e
mn015|now what could imagine to you know have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history yeah.|s|s^f
mn015|that's the really stupid way.|s^ba
mn015|then there is the really clever way that was suggested by keith.|s^rt
mn015|and then there is the uh middle way that i'm suggesting.|s
mn015|and that is you you get x.   which is whatever.|s
mn015|the castle.|s
mn015|the ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours.|s
mn015|that they have admission fees.|s
mn015|they have whatever.|s^rt
mn015|and then this is we go via a thesaurus.|s
mn015|and look up certain linguistic surface structures that are related to these concepts.|s
mn015|and feed those through the dialogue history.|s
mn015|and check dynamically|s.%--
mn015|for each entity we look it up check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse side.|s
mn015|but keith suggested that a a much cleaner way would be is you know to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you if you know that something like that has been mentioned before this just continues to add up|s.%-
mn015|you know in in a|s.%-
me045|so if someone mentions admission fees that activates an enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your in the representation of what's being talked about.|s
me045|and then when someone asks where is x.   you've already got the the enter schema activated.|s:qw
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|kind of a priming|s.%-
me045|and you're able to to conclude on it.|s
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|priming a spreading activation.|s^2
me010|right.|b
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me010|yeah so that's certainly more realistic.|fg|s
me010|i i mean psychologically.|s^e
me045|right.|b
me010|now technically|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
me010|um|fh
me003|well uh is it doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a a thread that you know kept track of of the activity of|fg|qh.%--
me003|i mean because it would the the thread would know what nodes like needed to be activated.|s
me003|so it could just keep track of how long it's been since something's been mentioned and automatically load it in.|s
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|you could do that.|s^am
me010|um|fh
me010|but here's here's a way|s.%--
me010|in in the bayes-net you could you could think about it this way that if um at the time admissions fee was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to enter.|s
fe004|turn prior on.|s
me003|yeah that's what i i wasn't i was i wasn't thinking in terms of enter schemas.|s^bk|s
me003|i was just|s.%-
me010|fair enough okay.|s^ba|s^bk
me010|but but in terms of the the current implementation|s.%--
me010|right.|s^f
me010|so that|s.%--
me010|um|fh
fe004|it would already be higher in the context.|s^2
me010|that the the the conditional probability that someone|s.%--
me010|so at the time you mentioned it|s.%--
me010|this is this is essentially the bayes-net equivalent of the spreading activation.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|it's in some ways it's not as good.|s
me010|but it's the implementation we got.|s^df
me045|yeah sure.|s^aa
me010|we don't have a connectionist implementation.|s^df^e
me045|no i mean|s.%-
me010|now now my guess is that it's not a question of time but it is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned.|s
fe004|yeah relevance.|fg|s^2
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|i mean we could look at|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
me010|this is|s.%--
me010|of course the other thing we we do is is we have this data coming.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|which probably will blow all our theories.|s
me010|but but skipping that|s.%--
me045|yeah right.|s^bk
me010|so so but my guess is what what'll probably will happen here's a here's a proposed design is that there're certain constructions which uh for our purposes do change the probabilities of eva decisions and various other kinds.|s
me010|and|fh
me010|that the uh standard way that that these contexts work is sort of stack like or whatever.|s
me010|but that's sort of the most recent thing.|s
me010|and so it could be that when another uh tourist entity gets mentioned you|s.%-
fe004|renew.|s^2
me010|essentially you know re i   essentially re-initialize the state.|s
me003|huh.|b
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and of course if we had a fancier one with multiple worlds you could have uh you could keep track of what someone was uh saying about this and that.|s
me010|you know i want to go in the morning.|s^e
me045|yeah.|b
me010|i want to|s^e.%-:s.%-
me045|here's my plan for today.|s
me045|here's my plan for tomorrow.|s
me010|yeah or yeah in the morning morning i'm planning to go shopping.|s^aa|s^na:s
me045|hypothetically.|s^e
me010|in the afternoon to the powder tower.|s^e^na:s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|uh so i'm talking about shopping.|s
me010|and then you say uh you know well um what's it cost or something.|s:qw
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|or|%--
me010|anyway.|fh
me010|so one could well imagine|s.%--
me010|but not yet.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|but i do think that the it'll turn out that it's going to be depend pretty much on whether there's been an override.|s
mn015|yeah i mean if if you ask how much does a train ride and and cinema around the vineyards cost and then somebody tells you it's sixty dollars and then you say okay how much is uh i would like to visit the whatever something completely different then i go to you know point reyes.|fg|s:qw
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|it it's not more likely that you want to enter anything.|s
mn015|but it's as a matter of fact a complete rejection of entering by doing that.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|right.|b
me010|right.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so when you have admission fee and it changes something it's only for that particular it's relational right?|s^bu|qy^d^rt
fe004|it's only for that particular object.|s^bu^e
me010|yeah i|s^aa|%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|well and and and the simple idea is that it's it's only for for the current uh tourist entity of interest.|s^e
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me045|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|right.|b
mn015|yeah but that's|fg|s.%-
mn015|i mean this this function|s.%--
mn015|so has the current object been mentioned in in with a question about concerning its|s.%-
me010|no no it's it it goes the other it goes in the other direction.|s^ar|s
me010|is|%--
me010|when when the this is mentioned the uh probability of of let's say entering changes.|s
fe004|of that object.|s^2
me010|changes.|s^2
fe004|for but|%-
fe004|right.|s^bk
me003|you could just uh just basically it it observes an uh it sets the a node for entered or true or something.|s^cs:s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|yeah.|b
me010|now uh but i think robert's right that to determine that okay you may well want to go through a thesaurus.|fg|s
me003|discourse enter.|s^e
me010|and and|fh
me010|so if the issue is if so now this construction has been matched and you say okay does this actually have any implications for our decisions then there's another piece of code that presumably does that computation.|fg|s:qy
fe004|so sort of forward chaining in a way rather than backward.|s^bu
me010|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|but but what's robert's saying is is|s.%--
me010|and i think he's right is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself all the synonyms and all you know all the|s.%--
me010|uh|fh
me010|maybe.|s^am^t1
me010|i'll have to think about that.|s^cc
fe004|huh.|b
me010|i don't know.|s^no
me010|i mean it i can i can think of arguments in either direction on that.|s
me010|but somehow you want to do it.|s^df
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|well it's just another sort of construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history.|s
mn015|or changing of the probabilities and or.|s:s
fe004|guess it's like i the other thing is whether you have a user model that has you know whatever a current plan whatever plans that had been discussed.|s
fe004|and|%--
fe004|i don't know.|s^bd^no
fe004|i mean|s.%--
me003|what uh what's the argument for putting it in the construction?|qw^rt
me003|is it just that the synonym selection is better or|qo.%-
me010|oh well the the the argument is that you're going to have the|s.%--
me010|if you've recognized the word|s.%--
me010|you've recognized the word which means you have a lexical construction for it.|s
me010|so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it's a uh you know thirty percent increase in probability of entering.|s
me010|you so you could you could you could invert invert the whole thing so you you tag that information on to the lexicon.|s
me003|huh.|b
me003|oh i see.|s^bk
me010|since you had to recognize it anyway.|s^df
me010|that that's the argument in the other direction.|s
me010|at at|%--
me010|yeah and this is|fh|%--
mn015|even though uh the lexical construction itself out out of context uh won't do it.|s
mn015|i mean you have to keep track whether the person says.|s^df
mn015|but but i'm not interested in the opening times.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
mn015|is sort of more a v.   type.|s^e
me010|yeah there's yeah there's that as well.|fg|s^na
mn015|yep.|b
mn015|huh.|b.%
mn015|so|fh.%
mn015|but we'll|s.%--
mn015|uh we have time to|s.%--
mn015|this is a just a sidetrack.|s
mn015|but uh|fh
mn015|i think it's also something that people have not done before is um sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of uh inferences on|s.%--
mn015|whether anything relevant to the current something has been uh has crept up in the dialogue history already or not.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|i have the uh if we wanted to have that function in the dialogue dialogue module of smartkom i have the written consent of jan to put it in there.|s
me010|good.|s^ba
me010|okay well this this is highly relevant to someone's thesis.|fg|s
mn015|yes.|s^aa
mn015|um that's uh i'm i'm keeping on good terms with jan.|fh|s
me010|you've noticed that.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so the point is it's very likely that robert's thesis is going to be along these lines.|s
me010|and the local rules are if it's your thesis you get to decide how it's done.|s
fe004|oh|s^bk|%-
me010|okay so if you know if this is seriously if this becomes part of your thesis you can say hey we're going to do it this way that's the way it's done.|s^bk|s:s
mn015|huh.|b.%
fe004|yay it's not me!|s^fe^rt
fe004|it's always me when it's someone's thesis.|s
me010|no no no!|s^ar^fe
me010|no no we've got a lot we've got a lot of theses going.|s^nd
me045|there's a few of us around now.|s^na
fe004|yay!|s^fe
fe004|i know it is.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|well let's let's talk after friday the twenty ninth.|s^cs^t^tc
mn015|then we'll see how|s.%-
me010|right so he's got a he's got a meeting in germany with his thesis advisor.|fg|s
fe004|yeah he said he's going to finish his thesis by then.|fg|s
me045|oh yeah.|s^bk
mn015|yeah.|b.%
mn015|i should try to finish it by then yeah.|s|s^bk
me010|oh right.|s^bk
mn015|so|fh
me010|um|fh
me010|yeah so i think in fact that's the other thing.|fg|s
me010|uh this is this is speaking of hard problems this is a very good time um to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in.|s
me010|and you know where where the construction per se ends and where construal comes in.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b.%
mn015|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|because this is clearly part of|s^df.%-
fe004|yeah we've we've done quite a bit of that.|fg|s
me010|huh?|qw^br
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|we've been doing quite a bit of that.|s^r
me045|yeah.|b
me010|well i said but that's part of what the|s.%-
fe004|we have many jobs for you robert.|s
me010|yeah well he's going to need this.|fg|s^df
fe004|the conclusion.|s^e
me045|yeah it seems to always land in your category.|fg|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right so right so thing that's part of why we want the formalism.|fg|s
me045|you're lucky.|s^ba^j
me010|is is because it is going to have implicit in it|s.%-
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|was i in the room?|qy^rt
fe004|no you weren't there on purpose.|s^ar|s^nd
fe004|like|%-
me045|made it much easier to make these decisions.|s^ba^j
fe004|obviously.|s^e
me045|uh|fh
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|right well i that's tentative.|fg|s^ng
me010|they aren't decisions.|s^nd
me045|yeah right right right.|s^bk
me010|they're they're just proposals.|s^e
fe004|no they're decisions.|s^ar|s^j^nd
me045|yes excuse me.|s^aa^j|s^fa^j
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|yeah that that's the point is is|s.%-
me045|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|constraints.|s
mn015|let's call them constraints around which one has to|s^cs^e.%-
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|yeah anyway but so that's that's|fg|s.%-
fe004|actually|s^nd.%-
fe004|yeah there's a problem with that word too though.|s^bk|s^nd
me003|yeah but it the decisions i made had to do with my thesis.|fg|s^df
me010|yeah.|b.%
me003|so consequently don't i get to decide then that it's robert's job?|qy^bu
me010|no.|s^ar
me010|uh|fh
me045|anyhow.|s
fe004|well i'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center and say it's robert's.|s
mn015|i've always been completely in favor of consensus decisions.|s
fe004|like|fh
mn015|so we'll we'll find a way.|s
me010|right.|b.%
fe004|i can|%
me010|well we we we will.|s
me010|but um|fh
fe004|i haven't okay.|s|s^bk
me010|not|%-
mn015|it it might even be interesting then to say that i should be forced to um sort of pull some of the ideas that have been floating in my head out of the uh out of the top hat.|s
me010|yes.|s^aa
mn015|and um|fh
me045|always good.|s^ba
me010|right.|b
mn015|that metaphor is not going anywhere you know.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|no absolutely.|s^ar|s
me010|so uh you had you know you you had done one draft.|s^bu
mn015|yes and um it's none of that is basically still around.|s^aa|s
me010|and another draft|s.%-
fe004|i didn't get|s.%-
mn015|but it's|s.%-
me010|okay.|s^bk
me045|that's normal.|s^ba
fe004|oh i guess it's good i didn't read it.|s^ba
me010|i this is i'm shocked.|s^j
me010|this is the first time i've seen a thesis proposal change.|s^j
me010|right anyway uh so|fh
fe004|really?|qy^bh
me010|but yeah a second that would be great.|fh|s^ba
me010|so uh a i mean you're going to need it anyway.|s
mn015|huh.|b.%
mn015|yeah and i would like to discuss it.|s^aa|s
me010|and|%-
mn015|and you know get you guys's input.|s
me010|right.|b
mn015|and make it sort of bomb proof.|s
me010|yep.|s^bk
fe004|bomb proof.|s^bk^m
me045|good.|s^bk
fe004|oh oh okay.|s^bk
mn015|bulletproof.|s^bsc
mn015|that's the word i was looking for.|s
me010|both proof.|s.%
me045|either way.|s
fe004|both.|s
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|uh|fg
fe004|good luck really.|s^ba
me010|so that so this i mean so this is the point is we we're going to have to cycle through this.|s
me010|but the draft of the proposal on the constructions is is going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by construal.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|and um we ought to be doing it.|fh|s^cs
mn015|okay.|b
mn015|yeah we need we need some then we need to make some dates.|fg|s^cs
mn015|um|fh
mn015|meeting regular meeting time for the summer.|s
mn015|we really haven't found one.|s
mn015|we did thursdays one for a while.|s
mn015|i just talked to ami.|s
mn015|it's a coincidence that he can't do couldn't do it today here.|s
fe004|usually he can.|s
mn015|usually he has no real constraints.|s^na
mn015|so|fh
me010|and the n. t. l meeting moved to wednesday.|s
me010|because of of uh|s^df.%--
mn015|yeah it was just an exception.|fg|s
me010|yeah you weren't here.|fg|s
me010|but but but uh and so if that's okay with you.|s^bu
me010|you would|%-
me045|it's is it staying basically at the wednesday noon?|qy^rt
me010|yeah it was|s^aa|s.%-
me045|okay it was off this week.|s^bk|s
fe004|yeah i always thought it was staying.|s^aa|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|right.|b
fe004|yeah i thought it was just this week that we were changing it.|fg|s^r
mn015|huh yeah.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and um how do we feel about doing it wednesdays?|fg|qw^cs
mn015|because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we have things to discuss with other people there.|s^df
mn015|they seem to be tons of people around.|s^df^e
me010|the only disadvantage is that it may interfere with other.|s
mn015|or|%-
mn015|subgroup meetings.|s^2
me010|you know other other|s.%-
me010|no you uh people in this group connecting with with.|s^ar|s
fe004|those people who happen to be around.|s^2
me010|those people who who might not be around so much.|s^m^na
me010|uh i don't care.|h|s
me010|uh you know i have no fixed|s^e.%-
me045|to tell you the truth i'd i'd i'd would like to avoid more than one i. c. s. i meeting per day if possible.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me045|but i mean i don't know.|s^bd^no
me045|whatever.|s
me010|no that's fine.|s^ba^bd
me010|i mean that|s.%-
mn015|the i'd like to have them all in one day.|s
mn015|so package them up and then|s^df.%-
me045|yeah i can understand that.|s^bk|s^ba
me010|well|s.%-
me010|people people differ in their tastes in this matter.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|i i'm neutral.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|yeah i'm always here anyway.|fg|s
mn015|it's okay that|s.%-
fe004|so|fh
me010|yeah that's me too.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|it doesn't matter.|s
me010|i'm basically i'm here.|s
me010|so|fh
mn015|well if one sort of thing is this room is taken at after three thirty pretty much every day.|s
mn015|by the data collection.|s^e
fe004|oh.|s^bk
mn015|so we have subjects anyway except for this week we have subjects in here.|s^df
mn015|that's why it was one.|s
fe004|oh.|s^bk.%
me010|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn015|so we just knew|s.%-
fe004|so did you just say that ami can't make one o'clock?|qy^bu^rt
mn015|no he can.|s^ar|s^nd
fe004|oh okay.|s^bk
me045|oh.|s^bk
mn015|so let's say thursday one.|s^cs
mn015|but for next week this is a bit late.|s^df
mn015|so i would suggest that we need to to talk|s^cs.%-
fe004|oh oh|fg
fe004|okay.|b
mn015|okay about the the|s^bk|s^tc.%-
fe004|could we do thursday at one thirty?|qy^rt
fe004|would that that be horrible?|qy^e^rt
mn015|no.|s^ar
mn015|yes.|s^aa
fe004|oh really?|qy^bh^rt
mn015|because uh this room is again taken at two thirty by morgan.|s^df
fe004|oh okay okay you didn't tell me that.|s^bk|s^df
fe004|okay that's fine.|s^bk|s^ba
mn015|and the meeting recorder meeting meeting meeting recording on meeting meetings.|s
fe004|okay okay okay okay yeah.|s^bk
mn015|so|fh
me010|interesting.|s^ba.%
me045|uh yeah.|s^bk
me010|so you're proposing that we meet tuesday.|s^bu
mn015|how about that?|qw
me010|i i could|%-
me045|next week.|s^2
fe004|well we're meeting tuesday.|s
fe004|i mean we usually meet tuesday or like linguists um at two.|s
me003|would it|%-
me045|that's right.|s^bk
fe004|so|fh
me003|and the|s.%-
fe004|do you want to meet again here|qy.%-
mn015|i mean|s.%-
me003|is the speech-gen meeting still at on tuesdays?|qy^rt
mn015|well actually we did scrap our monday time just because bhaskara couldn't come monday.|s
fe004|hhh maybe i do need a palm pilot.|s^t3
mn015|so there's nothing's impeding monday anymore either.|s
me045|that doesn't apply to a|s^t3.%-
mn015|get a fresh start.|s
me003|although i thought you wanted to go camping on monday uh take off mondays a lot so you could go camping.|s^bu
mn015|yeah that's another thing yeah.|s^na|s^aa
mn015|but um i mean there are also usually then holidays anyways.|fg|s
mn015|i mean like sometimes it works out that way.|s^na
fe004|usually?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|so huh.|fg|s^bk
fe004|well i mean the linguists' meeting happens to be at two.|fg|s
fe004|but i think that's i mean|s.%-
me045|that should be relatively flexible|s.%-
fe004|pretty flexible i think.|s
me045|yeah there's just sort of the two to four of us.|s^aa|s
fe004|so|fh
fe004|the multiple meetings.|s^2
me045|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|so|fh
fe004|right.|s^bk
me045|and you know of course nancy and i are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|so you know i mean|s.%--
mn015|okay so forget about the the camping thing.|s^bk|s^co
mn015|so let's uh any other problems|qo.%--
mn015|but i suggested monday.|s
mn015|if that's a problem for me then i shouldn't suggest it.|s
me003|ha ha ha.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk.%
mn015|so|fh
me045|um all of the proposed times sound fine with me.|s
fe004|same here.|s^na
mn015|monday?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|okay i mean what i think robert's saying is that|s^bk|s.%-
me045|earlier in the week.|s^2
me010|earlier we|s^m^na.%--
me010|at least for next week there's a lot of stuff we want to get done.|s^df
me045|uhhuh yeah.|b
me010|so why don't we plan to meet monday?|qh^cs
mn015|huh.|b
me010|and we'll see if we want to meet any more than that.|s^cc
me045|okay.|s^aa
mn015|okay.|s^bk
fe004|what time?|qw^rt
fe004|at one two three?|qy^bu^d^e^rt
mn015|one two three?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|three's too late.|s^df
mn015|two thirty?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|oh i yeah i actually two is the earliest i can meet on monday.|s^bk|s
mn015|okay two.|s^bk|s
me010|here i'm blissfully agreeing to things and realizing that i actually do have some stuff scheduled on monday.|s
me045|sure sounds great.|s:s^aa|s^na
me045|uh so that's the eighteenth.|s
fe004|you guys will still remind me right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
me003|no way.|s^ar
fe004|you'll come and take all the the the good headphones first and then remind me.|s^j
mn015|why do you|qw.%-
me045|yeah exactly.|s^aa
mn015|and|fh
me045|sorry two p. m.|s^fa|s
fe004|why do i have this unless i'm going to write?|qw^t1
mn015|do i get to see uh your formalism before that?|qy^rt
fe004|fine.|s^ba^t1
fe004|yes.|s^t1
fe004|uh would you like to?|h|qy^rt
mn015|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn015|i i would like i would sort of get a get a notion of what what you guys have in store for me.|s
fe004|okay i was actually going to work on it for tomorrow like this this weekend.|s^bk|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|well you know maybe maybe we can put this is part of what we can do monday if we want.|s^rt
fe004|yeah|s^bk|%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me045|all right.|s^bk
mn015|okay.|b.%
fe004|i mean i i i|s.%-
me010|is some some version.|s
fe004|yeah so there was like you know in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version like everything i know.|s^aa|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and then i would talk to you and figure out everything you know that you know see if they're consistent.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|okay.|b
me045|why don't maybe you and i should meet sort of more or less first thing monday morning and then we can work on this.|s^cs
fe004|yes yeah.|s^aa
fe004|that's fine with me.|s^na
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so|fh
fe004|i might i might um|s.%--
fe004|you said you're busy over until the weekend right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
me045|yeah sort of through the weekend.|s^aa|s
me045|because kate has a photography show.|s^df
fe004|that's fine so we might continue our email thing.|s^bk|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|and that might be fine too.|s
fe004|so maybe i'll send you some.|s
me045|um if you have time after this i'll show you the noun phrase thing.|s
fe004|okay that would be cool.|s^bk|s^ba
fe004|so|fh
fe004|okay and we'll you want to|fg|s.%-
mn015|so the idea is on monday at two we'll we'll see an intermediate version of the formalism for the constructions.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so that's okay for you|s^bu.%-
mn015|and do an online merging with my construal ideas.|s^e
fe004|sure sure.|s^bk
me010|okay.|s^bk
me045|all right.|s^bk
mn015|so it won't be like a semi formal presentation of my proposal.|s
fe004|that's okay.|s
mn015|it'll be more like towards finalizing that proposal.|s^e
mn015|okay that's fine.|s^bk
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|because then you'll find out more of what we're making you do.|s
mn015|yep and then|fg|%-
me045|yeah.|b.%
me003|huh huh.|b
mn015|yikes.|s^ba
me045|oy deadlines.|s
fe004|we'll make a presentation of your of your proposal.|s^cc^j
mn015|perfect can you also write it up?|s^ba^j|qy^j^rt
fe004|it's like this is what we're doing.|s^rt:s^rt
fe004|and the complement is robert.|s:s
mn015|i'll i'll send you|s^j.%-
mn015|i'll i'll send you a style file right?|s^j|qy^d^f^g
fe004|okay.|s
mn015|you just|s.%-
fe004|i already sent you my my bib file.|s
fe004|so|fh
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|sounds good.|s^ba.%
me045|someday we also have to we should probably talk about the other side of the where is x.   construction.|s^cs:qw
me045|which is the issue of um how do you simulate questions?|qh
me045|what does the simspec look like for a question?|qh^e
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
me010|uhhuh.|b
me045|because it's a little different.|s^df
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|yeah now we|fg|s.%-
me045|we had to we had an idea for this which seemed like it would probably work.|s
me010|great okay.|s^ba|s^bk
me010|yeah simspec may need we may need to rename that.|fg|s^cs
fe004|i yeah i|s^aa|%-
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|okay so let's think of a name for for whatever the this intermediate structure is.|s^bk|s^cs
me010|oh we talked about semspec for semantic specification.|s
me045|huh.|b
me010|and that seems|s.%--
me010|um|fh
me045|it's more general.|s^2
me010|you know so it's a minimal change.|s
fe004|only have to change one vowel.|s
fe004|that's great.|s^ba
me010|yeah just|%
fe004|all the old like graphs.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|just change the just like mark out the|s.%-
me045|cool.|s^ba
me010|right a little|fg|s.%--
me010|you know that's what text substitution uh macros are for.|s
me045|yeah it's good for you.|s^aa|s
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me010|anyway uh so let's let's for the moment call it that until we think of something better.|fg|s^cs
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|and yeah we absolutely need to find|s.%--
me010|part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there.|s
me010|including the questions.|s^e
me010|we didn't we never did figure out how we were going to do emphasis in in uh the semspec.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|yeah we've talked a little bit about that too.|fg|s
fe004|which|%--
fe004|uh uh it's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues how they map onto this particular one.|s
fe004|but|fh
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|okay yeah understood.|s^bk
me010|but that's part of the formalism.|s
me010|is got to be uh how things like that get marked.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|do you have data like the the you have preliminary data?|qy
fe004|because i know you know we've been using this one easy sentence.|s^df
fe004|and i'm sure you guys have uh maybe you are the one who've been looking at the rest of it.|s
me045|um|%-
fe004|it'd it'd be useful for me if we want to have it a little bit more data oriented.|s
me045|to tell you the truth what i've been looking at has not been the data so far.|s^rt
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me045|and i have not gotten them out of the way yet.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|surprise.|s^j
me045|so um|fh
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|so i have not really approached a lot of the data.|s
me045|but i mean obviously like these the the question one.|s
me045|since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that you know i can try and um run with that.|s
me045|you know try and do some of the sentence constructions now.|s
mn015|okay do you want to run the indefinite pronoun idea past jerry?|fg|qy^cs^rt
me045|it would make sense.|s
fe004|okay.|b
me045|oh yeah the basic idea is that|s^bk|s.%--
me045|um uh you know|fh|%--
me045|uh let's see if i can formulate this.|s
mn015|so mary fixed the car with a wrench.|s:s
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|so you perform the mental sum.|s
mn015|and then you know who fixed the car with a wrench.|s:qw
mn015|you basically are told to to do this.|s^rt
mn015|in the in analogously to the way you would do someone fixed the car with a wrench.|s^e
mn015|and then you hand it back to your hippocampus.|s
mn015|and find out what that you know.|s
me045|means.|s^2
mn015|means.|s^aa^m
mn015|and then come up with that so who that someone was.|s^e
me045|the w. h question has this as sort of extra thing which says and when you're done tell me who fills that slot or you know.|s:s
me010|uhhuh.|b
me045|so um|fh
me045|and you know this is sort of a nice way to do it.|s
me045|the idea of sort of saying that you treat from the simulation point of view or whatever you treat uh w. h constructions similarly to uh indefinite pronouns.|s
me045|like someone fixed the car.|s:s
me045|because lots of languages um have w. h questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever.|s^df
fe004|use actually the same one.|s^2
me045|and you just get intonation to tell you that it's a question.|s
me010|all right which is|s^bk|%-
me045|so it makes sense.|s
me045|um|fh
me010|skolemization.|s
me045|huh?|qw^br^rt
me010|in in logic it's it's it's huh.|s
fe004|huh.|b
fe004|right let's put a skolem skolem constant in.|fg|s:s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|what?|qw^br
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|sure.|s^bk
fe004|yeah right.|s^bk
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|that's not that's not saying it's bad.|s
me010|it's just that|s^df.%-
me045|right right no of course.|s^bk
fe004|huh.|b
me010|that that the logicians have have uh|s.%--
me045|that's right.|s^bk
mn015|come up with this.|s^2
me045|it makes sense from that point of view too which is actually better.|s
me045|so yeah um|fh
me045|anyway but just that kind of thing.|fg|s
me045|and we'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on.|s^cc
me045|but|fh
me010|good.|s^bk
me045|uh no all the focus stuff.|s
me045|we sort of just dropped that.|s
me045|because it was too weird.|s^df
me045|and we didn't even know like what we were talking about exactly.|s
me045|what the object of study was.|s
fe004|um huh.|b
me045|so|fh
me010|yeah well if if i mean part of of what the exercise is by the end of next week is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet.|s:qw
me045|yeah.|b
me010|that's fine.|s^ba
me045|yep.|b
me010|i mean|%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|well if you if you do want to discuss focus background and then get me into that.|s^cs
mn015|because i mean i i scientifically worked on that for for almost two years.|s^df
me045|yeah.|b
me045|okay then certainly we will.|s^bk|s^na
fe004|yeah you should definitely um be on on that|s^aa|s.%--
me045|good.|s^ba
fe004|maybe maybe by after monday we'll you can see what things we are and aren't|s.%-
me045|yeah we should figure out what our questions are for example to ask you.|fg|s
fe004|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me045|so|fh
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|hans.|s^tc
me010|has i haven't seen hans boas.|s^rt
fe004|he's been around.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|okay so has he been been involved with this?|s^bk|qy^rt
fe004|just maybe not today.|s
me010|or|qrr.%--
fe004|uh with us?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|i would say that that those discussions have been primarily um keith and keith and me.|s^e
fe004|but um|fh
fe004|like in the meeting i mean he sort of i like the last meeting we had i think we were all very much part of it.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|but um|fh
me045|sometimes hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a devil's advocate type role or something.|s^rt
fe004|but different|s.%-
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me045|like this make you know i'm going to pretend i'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this.|s^rt:s^rt
me045|this makes no sense.|s:s^ba
me045|and he'll just go off on parts of it which definitely need fixing.|s
fe004|right.|b
me045|but aren't where we're at right now.|s
fe004|like like what you call certain things.|s
me045|so it's|s.%-
fe004|which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|right.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk
fe004|but in a sense it's good to know that he of all people|s^ba^bd.%--
fe004|you know like maybe a lot of people would have much stronger reactions.|s^ba^bd^e
fe004|so you know he's like a relatively friendly linguist.|s^e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|and yet a word like constraint causes a lot of problems.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|and so right so|fh
me010|okay this is consistent with um the role i had suggested that he he play.|s^bk|s
fe004|uh.|s^bk
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|okay which was that one of the things i would like to see happen is a paper that was tentatively called towards a formal cognitive semantics.|s^f|s
me010|which was addressed to these linguists uh who haven't been following this stuff at all.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so it could be that he's actually at some level thinking about how am i going to communicate this story.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so internally we should just do whatever works.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|because it's hard enough.|s^df
me045|yeah.|b
me010|but if he if he turns is is really going to turn around and help to write this version that does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world um then then it becomes important to use terminology that doesn't make it hard.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh sure.|b
me010|i mean it's going to be plenty hard for for people to understand it as it is.|s^bd^df
me010|but you don't want to make it worse.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so|fh
me045|no right i mean that role is is uh indispensable.|s^aa|s^ba
me045|but that's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings.|s^df
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|yeah yeah no that's fine.|fg|s^ba
me045|it was a little strange.|s
me010|i just wanted to|s.%--
me010|i have to catch up with him and i wanted to get a feeling for that okay.|s
me045|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|so i don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly you know.|s
me010|okay good.|s^bk
me045|because sometimes he sort of sounds like we're talking a bunch of goobledy-gook from his point of view.|s^df
fe004|i think it's good when we're|s.%-
fe004|when we're into data and looking at the some specific linguistic phenomenon in in english or in german in particular whatever that's great.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and ben and and hans are if if anything more you know they have more to say than let's say i would about some of these things.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|but when it's like well how do we capture these things you know i think it's definitely been keith and i who have you know who have worried more about the|s.%-:qh
me010|well that's good that's i think that should be the the core group.|s^ba|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|which is fine.|s^ba
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and um|fh
me010|that's you know i think very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|yes.|s^aa
fe004|yeah we actually have i think we have been making progress.|fg|s
fe004|and its sort of surprising.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|i i i i definitely get that impression yeah.|s^na|s^aa
fe004|you know like|s.%--
me010|that's great.|s^ba
me045|yep.|s^bk
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|so anyone else would like uh ruin the balance of|s^j.%--
fe004|anyway.|s
me010|well but well but then then we have to come back to the bigger group.|s
fe004|right.|s^bk
me045|yeah.|b
me010|yeah great and then we're we're going to|fg|s.%--
me010|because of this other big thing we haven't talked about is actually implementing this stuff.|s^rt
me010|so that i guess the three of us are going to connect tomorrow about that.|s
fe004|yeah we could talk tomorrow.|s^aa|s
fe004|i was just going to say though that for instance there was you know out of a meeting with johno came the suggestion that oh could it be that the meaning constraints really aren't used for selection.|s:qh
fe004|which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|in which case we we can just say that they're the effects or the bindings.|s
fe004|which uh so far in terms of like putting up all the constraints as you know pushing them into type constraints the when i've you know then proposed it to linguists who haven't yet given me you know we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work.|s
fe004|right as long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably complex.|s^f|s^e
me010|well it|s.%-
fe004|so anyway to be to talk about later.|s^cc
me010|yeah it has to in the sense that you're going to use them|fg|s.%--
me010|it's you know it's sort of a um generate and test kind of thing.|s
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me010|and if you over generate then you'll have to do more.|s
me010|i mean if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use uh in your initial matching then you'll match some things.|s
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me010|i mean i i i don't think there's any way that it could completely fail.|s
me010|it it could be that uh you wind up|s.%--
me010|i mean|%--
me010|the original bad idea of purely context free grammars died because there were just vastly too many parses.|s
me010|you know exponentially many parses.|s^e
me010|and so the concern might be that not that it would totally fail but that|s.%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|that it would still generate too many right?|s^2|qy^d^f^g
me010|it would still|s^m^na.%-
fe004|so by just having even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of semantic types right?|s|qy^d^g
fe004|like conceptually these have to be construed as this this and this might still give us quite a few possibilities.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|we don't know.|s^no
fe004|that you know and and it certainly helps a lot.|s
me010|but yeah.|s^aa
fe004|i mean let's put it that way.|s
me010|no question yeah.|s^na|s^aa
fe004|so|fh
me010|and i think it's a it's a perfectly fine place to start.|s
me010|you know and say let's see how far we can go this way.|s
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me010|and uh|fh
me003|well it definitely makes the problem easier.|s
me010|i'm i'm in favor of that.|s
me010|uh because i think i think it's as you know i think it's real hard and if if we|s^df.%--
me010|right.|s^bk
fe004|so friday?|qy^bu^d
fe004|monday?|qy^bu^d
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|monday.|s^bk
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|so okay that's tuesday.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|like that's the conclusion okay.|s|s^bk
mn015|so your dance card is completely filled now?|qy^d^j^rt
me003|uhhuh.|b
me045|shoot.|s^ba
fe004|yeah and i have nothing to do this weekend but work.|s^aa^j|s^j
mn015|why don't|%-
fe004|no that's not really true|s^ar|s.%-
fe004|but like|%--
me045|bummer.|s^ba
me003|what about what about d. d. r?|qw
fe004|it's almost true.|s
fe004|oh i don't have it this weekend.|s
fe004|so tsk don't have to worry about that.|s
me003|huh.|s^bk
me010|d. d. r he asked?|qw^br^d
fe004|speaking of dance.|s
fe004|dance dance revolution.|s
fe004|i can't believe i'm|s.%--
fe004|it's a it's like a game but it's for like dancing.|s
fe004|hard to it's like karaoke but for dancing.|s^e
fe004|and they tell you what|s.%--
fe004|it's amazing.|s^ba
fe004|it's so much fun.|s^ba
fe004|yeah it's so good.|s^ba
fe004|my friend has a home version and he brought it over.|s
fe004|and we are so into it.|s
fe004|it's so amazing.|s
fe004|well you know of it?|qy^d^rt
fe004|it's one of your hobbies?|qy^d^e^rt
fe004|it's great exercise i must say.|s
fe004|i can't wait to hear this.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|oh definitely they have like places instead of like yeah instead of karaoke bars now that have like d. d. r.|s^aa|s
fe004|like|%--
fe004|yeah yeah i didn't until i started hanging out with this friend who's like oh well i can bring over the d. d. r if you want.|s^bk|s^ba:s
fe004|oh oh dance dance revolution okay.|s:s
fe004|he actually brought a clone called stepping selection.|s
fe004|but it's just as good.|s^ba
fe004|so|fh
me003|what things to talk about.|z
fe004|i'm what?|z
fe004|really?|z
fe004|oh that's horrible!|z
fe004|disincentive!|z
mn015|okay we're recording.|z
fe004|hello?|z
me003|check check check check.|z
fe004|hello?|z
fn050|uh yeah.|z
fe004|which am i?|z
me010|oh right.|z
me003|all right good.|z
fe004|channel okay.|z
fe004|okay.|z
fe004|are you doing something?|qy^rt^t
fe004|okay then i guess i'm doing something.|s^bk|s^t
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|so basically the result of much thinking since the last time we met um but not as much writing um is a sheet that i have a lot of like thoughts and justification of comments on.|s
fe004|but i'll just pass out as is right now.|s
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|here.|s
fe004|if you could pass this around.|s^cs^rt
fe004|and there's two things.|s
fe004|and so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification.|s
fn050|um|%-
fe004|and the other side is um sort of a revised construction formalism.|s
fn050|the|%-
fn050|wait.|s^co
me045|this is just one sheet right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
fn050|uh.|s^bk
fe004|it's just one sheet.|s^na
fn050|just one sheet.|s^na
fe004|it's just a nothing else.|s
fn050|okay.|s^bk
fn050|front back.|s
fe004|um|fh
fe004|enough to go around?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|and in some ways it's it's it's very similar to|s.%--
fe004|there are very few changes in some ways from what we've um uh done before.|s
fe004|but i don't think everyone here has seen all of this.|s
fe004|so uh i'm not sure where to begin.|s
fe004|um as usual the disclaimers are there are all these things are|s.%--
fe004|it's only slightly more stable than it was before.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and um after a little bit more discussion and especially like keith and i i have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days um it'll probably change again some more.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um maybe i will|s.%--
fe004|let's start let's start on number two actually on the notation.|s
fe004|um because that's|s^df.%--
fe004|i'm thinking possibly a little more familiar to um to people.|s
fe004|okay so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract|s.%--
fe004|it's sort of like um listings of the kinds of things that we can have.|s
fe004|and certain things that have um changed have changed back to this.|s
fe004|there there's been a little bit of um going back and forth.|s
fe004|but basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name.|s
fe004|i forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line.|s
me010|what i was going to|s.%-
fe004|so something like um|s.%--
me010|right.|b
fe004|well there's an example.|s
fe004|the textual example at the end has clausal construction.|s
fe004|so|fh
fe004|um just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful latex.|s
fe004|it could be you know simple old text as well.|s
fe004|um there are a couple of|s.%--
fe004|uh these three have various ways of doing certain things.|s
fe004|so i'll just try to go through them.|s
fe004|so they could all have a type at the beginning.|s
fe004|um and then they say the key word construction.|s
me010|oh i see.|s^bk
fe004|and they have some name.|s
me010|so so the current syntax is if it if there's a type it's before|s^bu.%-
fe004|yeah right.|s^aa
me010|okay that's fine.|s^bk|s^ba
fe004|okay and then it has a block that is constituents.|fg|s
fe004|and as usual i guess all the constructions all the examples here have only um tsk one type of constituent.|s
fe004|that is a constructional constituent.|s^e
fe004|i think that's actually going to turn out to be certainly the most common kind.|s
fe004|but in general instead of the word construct here you might have meaning or form as well.|s
fe004|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
fe004|so if there's some element that doesn't that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|um the main change with the constructs which each of which has um the key word construct and then some name and then some type specification is that it's|fh|s.%--
fe004|it's it's often sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is.|s
fe004|so for example whatever i have here is going to be a form of the word throw.|s:s
fe004|or it's going to be a form of the word you know i don't know happy or something like that.|s^e:s
fe004|or you know it'll be a specific word.|s
fe004|or maybe you'll have the type.|s^e
fe004|you'll say i need a uh spatial relation phrase here.|s:s
fe004|or i need a directional specifier here.|s^e:s
fe004|uh you could have a a actual type here.|s
fe004|um or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type.|s
fe004|so a very common example of this is that you know in directed motion the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind.|s
fe004|often a human.|s^e
fe004|right?|qy^d^f^g
fe004|so if i you know um uh run down the street then i|s.%--
fe004|i i run down the street.|s
fe004|it's typed uh i.|s:s
fe004|meaning category is what's there.|s^e
fe004|the the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair.|s
fe004|and um|fh
fe004|sort of skipping fonts and whatever.|s
fe004|the idea is that sometimes there are um general constructions that you know that you're going to need.|s
fe004|it's it's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase or something like that there.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and usually it has formal um considerations that will go along with it.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and then uh you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you're talking about.|s
fe004|about what meaning what specific meaning you want.|s^e
fe004|so the example again at the bottom which is directed motion.|s:s
fe004|you might need a nominal expression to take the place of you know um the big you know the big the tall dark man you know walked into the room.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|but because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it's nominal of some kind.|s
fe004|but in particular that it's some kind of animate nominal.|s
fe004|and which will apply just as well to like you know a you know a simple proper noun.|s
fe004|or to some complicated expression.|s^e
fe004|um|fh
fe004|so i don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types.|s^no
fe004|so|fh
fe004|okay then i don't think the um|s^bk|s.%--
fe004|at least|s.%--
fe004|yeah none of these examples have anything different for formal constraints.|s^bk|s^rt
fe004|but you can refer to any of the um sort of available elements and scope.|s
fe004|right which here are the constructs to say something about the relation.|s^f|s
fe004|and i think if you if you compare like the top block and the textual block um we dropped like the little f.   subscript.|s
fe004|the f.   subscripts refer to the form piece of the construct.|s
me010|good.|s^ba
fe004|and i think that um in general it'll be unambiguous.|s
fe004|like if you were giving a formal constraint then you're referring to the formal pole of that.|s
fe004|so so by saying if i just said name one then that means name one formal.|s:s
fe004|and we're talking about formal which which makes sense.|s
fe004|uh there are certain times when we'll have an exception to that.|s
fe004|in which case you could just indicate here i mean the meaningful for some reason.|s^e
fe004|right.|s^f
fe004|or actually it's more often that only to handle this one special case of you know george and jerry walk into the room in that order.|s
fe004|so we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|but but we're not going to really worry about that for right now.|s
fe004|and there are we can be more specific if we have to later on.|s
fe004|okay and so in terms of the the relations.|s^bk|s^t^tc
fe004|you know as usual they're before and ends.|s
fe004|i should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation.|s
fe004|but in form you might also have a value binding.|s
fe004|you know you could say that um you know name one dot you know number equals you know a plural or something like that.|s:s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|there are certain things that are attribute value similar to the bindings below.|s
fe004|but i mean they're just usually they're going to be value value fillers right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|okay and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings.|s^bk|s
fe004|there was talk of changing the name of that.|s
fe004|and johno and i i you you and i can like fight about that if you like.|s
fe004|but about changing it to semantic effects.|s^rt
fe004|which i thought was a little bit too order biased.|s
me003|well|%-
fe004|and semantic bindings.|s
fe004|which i thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings.|s^df
fe004|and so it was an issue whether constraints um there were some linguists who reacted against constraints saying oh if it's not used for matching then it shouldn't be called a constraint.|s
fe004|but i think we want to be uncommitted about whether it's used for matching or not right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|because there are i think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the bindings are for.|s^df
fe004|actual you know sort of like modified constraining purposes.|s^e
me010|well you definitely want to de couple the formalism from the parsing strategy.|s
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me010|so that whether or not it's used for matching or only for verification i|s.%--
fe004|yeah yeah.|s^bk
fe004|it's used shouldn't matter right.|s^2|s^aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|for sure.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|i mean i don't know what uh term we want to use.|s^bd^no
me010|but we don't want to|s^df.%-
fe004|yeah uh there was one time when when hans explained why constraints was a misleading word for him.|s^bk|s:s
me010|yep.|s^bk
fe004|and i think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why johno thought it was a misleading term.|s
fe004|which was just an interesting coincidence.|s
fe004|um but uh|fh
fe004|and so i was like okay well both of you don't like it.|s:s^bk|s^rt
fe004|fine we can change it.|s^bk|s^cs^rt
me010|it's it's gone.|s
fe004|but i i i'm starting to like it again.|s
fe004|so that's why that's why i'll stick with it.|s
me003|but|%-
fe004|so|fh
mn015|well you know what?|qw
mn015|if you have an if then phrase do you know what the then phrase is called?|qy^rt
fe004|what?|qw
fe004|uh a consequent?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|yeah but it's not an if then.|s^bk|s^nd
me010|i know.|s^na
me010|anyway so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put you could put no word.|fg|s^cs:s
mn015|no but|s^ar|%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|just meaning.|s^e:s
me010|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me010|and then let|s.%-
fe004|yeah that's true.|s^aa|s^na
me003|so that's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down down here?|qy^bu^d
fe004|oh oops!|s^bk|s^fe
fe004|no that was just a mistake of cut and paste from when i was going with it.|s^ar|s^df
me003|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so i'm sorry.|s^fa
fe004|i didn't mean that one's an unintentional.|s
me003|so this should be semantic and|s.%-
fe004|sometimes i'm intentionally inconsistent.|s
fe004|because i'm not sure yet.|s^df^rt
fe004|here i actually it was just a mistake.|s
me003|so this definitely should be semantic constraints down at the bottom.|s^bu^rt
me045|sure.|s^aa
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me003|okay.|s^bk
fe004|well unless i go with meaning.|s:s
fe004|but i mean i kind of like meaning better than semantic.|s:s
me003|or|%-
me010|oh whatever.|s^bd
fe004|but i think there's vestiges of other people's biases.|s
me010|or|%-
fe004|like|%--
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|minor problem.|s^ba
fe004|minor point.|s^m^na
me045|extremely.|s^na
me010|okay.|s^bk
fe004|okay um|fg
fe004|so i think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information than the top block.|s
fe004|and the bottom block similarly only just you know all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the um uh that you can give dual types.|s
fe004|oh one thing i should mention is about designates.|s
fe004|i think i'm actually inconsistent across these as well.|s^rt
fe004|so um strike out the m.   subscript on the middle block.|s^co
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so basically now um this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change.|s
fe004|which is that designates isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now.|s
me010|good.|s^ba
fe004|so we want designates to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects.|s
fe004|but is sort of um really important for say composition later on.|s
fe004|so for instance if some other construction says you know are you of type is this part of type whatever um the designates tells you which sort of part is the meaning part.|s
fe004|okay so if you have like the big red ball you know you want to know if there's an object or a noun.|s^rt:s
fe004|well ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase.|s:s
me045|huh.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it's useful sometimes to talk about um to talk about there also being a designated object.|s
fe004|and we think that that'll be the same one right.|s|s^f
fe004|so the ball is the head of the phrase.|s:s
fe004|the the um big red ball.|s^e:s
fe004|and the entity denoted by the word ball is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of um interesting larger element.|s
me010|and the|s.%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|and there's uh there's some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head.|s^bu
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|and and this enables you to get that if i understand you right.|s^bu
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|right right.|s^aa
me045|that's the idea.|s^na
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah yeah.|s^bk
fe004|and uh you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head final language you can refer to the head as a the you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision.|s
me010|right.|s^bk
fe004|so that's a useful thing.|s
fe004|so that you can get some internal structural constraints in.|s^df
me010|okay so that all looks good.|s^bk|s^ba
me010|let me|s.%--
me010|oh oh|%--
me010|i don't know.|s^no
me010|were you finished?|qy
fe004|um there was a list of things that isn't included.|h|s
fe004|but you you can you can ask a question.|s
fe004|that might it.|s^e
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so if i understand this the|s.%--
me010|aside from uh construed and all that sort of stuff the the differences are mainly that we've gone to the possibility of having form meaning pairs for a type.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|or actually gone back to.|s^bsc
fe004|right.|b
me010|if we go back far enough|s.%-
fe004|well except for their construction meaning.|s^arp
fe004|so it's not clear that|s.%--
fe004|uh|fh
fe004|well right now it's a uh construction type and meaning type.|s
fe004|so i don't know what a form type is.|s^no
me010|oh i see.|s^bk
me010|yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
me010|i'm sorry.|s^fa
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|you're right.|s
me010|a construction type.|s
me010|uh that's fine.|s^ba
fe004|right.|s^bk
me010|but it um|s.%-
fe004|well and a previous um you know version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it.|s
fe004|so you could say construct of type whatever designates something.|s
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|but that was mostly for reference purposes.|s
fe004|just to refer to the meaning pole.|s
fe004|i don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning type constraint on the meaning.|s
fe004|which is really what we want most of the time i think.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|i i don't know if we'll ever have a case where we actually|s^no.%--
fe004|if there is a form category constraint you could imagine having a triple there that says you know that's kind of weird.|s
me010|no no no i don't think so.|s^ar|s^nd
me010|i think that you'll you'll do fine.|s^ba
me045|i|%-
me010|in fact these are um|s.%--
me010|as long as as mark isn't around these are form constraints.|s
me010|so a nominal expression is uh the fact that it's animate is semantic.|s
me010|the fact that it's uh a nominal expression i would say on most people's notion of of you know higher form types this this is one.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|right right.|s^bk
me045|yeah yeah.|s^bk
me010|and i think that's just fine.|s^ba
fe004|which is fine yeah.|s^m^na|s^aa
me045|it's that now um i'm mentioned this.|s
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me045|i i don't know if i ever explained this.|s^bd^df^no
me045|but the point of um|s.%--
me045|i mentioned in the last meeting the point of having something called nominal expression is um|s.%--:s
me045|because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for you know like say taking as its object just some expression which um designates an object or designates a thing or whatever um that leads to some syntactic problems basically.|s^rt
me045|so you want to you know you sort of have this problem like okay well i'll put the word uh let's say the word dog.|s:s
me045|you know and that has to come right after the verb.|s^f|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|because we know verb meets its object.|s^df
me045|and then we have a construction that says oh you can have the preceding a noun.|s:s
me045|and so you'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum.|s
me010|right.|b
me045|and you could get you know the kicked dog or something like that meaning kicked the dog.|s:s
me010|right.|b
me045|um so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there.|s
me045|but|fh
me010|that i i have no problem with it at all.|s^ba
me045|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me010|i think it's fine.|s^ba
fe004|right|s^bk|%--
fe004|you may be you may not be like everyone else in in berkeley.|s
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me045|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|but that's okay.|s^ba
me045|i mean we we we sort of thought we were getting away with uh with a|s.%--
fe004|uh we don't mind either.|s^bd
fe004|so|fh
me045|i mean this is not reverting to the x. bar theory of of phrase structure.|s
me010|right.|s^bk
me045|but uh|fh
fe004|right.|s^bk
me045|i just know that this is like we didn't originally have in mind that uh that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but they do.|s^df^rt
me045|um|fh
me045|but they does.|s^m^na
fe004|well there's an alternative to this.|s
me045|at least in english.|s^aap^e
fe004|which is um the question was did we want directed motion|s.%--
me010|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|which is an argument structure construction|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|did we want it to worry about um anything more than the fact that it you know has semantic|qy.%--
fe004|you know it's sort of frame based construction.|s
fe004|so one option that you know keith had mentioned also was like well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject predicate basically things like grammatical relations.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b.%
fe004|those could intersect with these.|s
fe004|in such a way that subject predicate or subject predicate subject verb you know verb object would require that those things that fill a subject and object are nom expressions.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|and that would be a little bit cleaner in some way.|s
fe004|but you know for now i mean|s.%--
me010|yeah.|b
me010|but it it's yeah just moving it moving the the the constraints around.|s^bd
fe004|uh you know.|fh
fe004|moving it to another place right.|s^m^na|s^aa
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|okay so that's|fg|s.%-
fe004|but there does basically the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
me010|right.|s^aa
fe004|so|fh
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me010|and so that was the|s.%-
fe004|robert's not happy now?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|no.|s^ar
fe004|oh okay.|s^bk
me010|okay and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair.|fg|s
fe004|yes.|s^bk
me010|instead of just the meaning.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and that aside from some terminology that's basically it.|s^bu
fe004|right.|s^aa
me010|i just want to i'm i'm asking.|s^bd^df
fe004|yep.|s^aa
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|um the sort of the un addressed questions in this um definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about.|s
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|here are just bindings.|s^e
fe004|but|%--
fe004|right.|s^f
fe004|we might want to introduce mental spaces.|s^rt
fe004|you know there's all these things that we don't|s.%-
me010|the whole the mental space thing is clearly not here.|s^nd
fe004|right.|s^aa
fe004|so there's going to be some extra you know definitely other notation we'll need for that which we skip for now.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|by the way i do want to get on that as soon as robert gets back.|s
fe004|uh|fh
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|so uh the the mental space thing.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|um obviously construal is a is a is a big component of that.|s
me010|so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back.|s
me010|but sort of as soon as he gets back i think um we ought to|s^cs.%-
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|so what's the what's the time frame?|qw
me045|i forgot again when|s.%--
me045|you're going away for how long?|qw
mn015|just uh as a sort of a mental bridge i'm not i'm skipping fourth of july.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so uh right afterwards i'm back.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|what?|qw
fe004|you're missing like the premier american holiday?|qy^bu^d^j
fe004|what's the point of spending a year here?|qw^j
mn015|uh i've had it often enough.|s^bd^df
fe004|so anyway|s.%--
me003|well he he went to college here.|s^df
fe004|oh yeah i forgot.|s^aa|s^df^no
fe004|oops sorry.|s^fa
me010|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|and furthermore it's well worth missing.|s
fe004|not in california.|s^arp
fe004|yeah that's true.|s^aa|s^na
me045|yes.|s^aa
fe004|i like i i like spending fourth of july in other countries whenever i can.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|um|fh
me010|okay so that's great.|fg|s^ba^t^tc
fe004|construal.|s^tc
fe004|okay so|s^bk|%--
fe004|oh so there was one question that came out.|s
fe004|i hate this thing.|s
fe004|sorry.|s^fa
fe004|um which is|s.%--
fe004|so something like past which you know we think is a very simple uh we've often just stuck it in as a feature.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|you know oh this event takes place before speech time okay is what this means.|s:s
me010|right.|b
fe004|um it's often thought of as it is also considered a mental space.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|you know by you know lots of people around here.|s^e
me010|right.|b
fe004|so there's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say in france blah blah blah.|s^rt:s^rt
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and you have to build up you you would imagine that would require you you know to be very specific about the machinery.|s
fe004|whereas past is a very conventionalized one.|s
fe004|and we sort of know what it means.|s
fe004|but it we doesn't don't necessarily want to you know unload all the notation every time we see that it's past tense.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|so you know we could think of our uh just like x. schema walk refers to this complicated structure past refers to you know a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it.|s
me010|i think that's exactly right.|s^na
fe004|so so we're kind of like having our cake and eating it.|s
fe004|you know having it both ways right?|s^e|qy^d^f^g
me010|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|so|%-
me010|yeah no i think i think that we'll have to see how it works out when we do the details.|s^aa|s^bd
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but my intuition would be that that's right.|s^df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah okay.|s^bk
mn015|do you want to do the same for space?|qy^rt
fe004|sorry?|qw^br
mn015|space.|s^r
fe004|space?|qw^br^m
mn015|here.|s^e
mn015|now.|s^e
fe004|oh oh oh oh instead of just time?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn015|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe004|same thing.|s^na
fe004|so there are very conventionalized like deictic ones right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|and then i think for other spaces that you introduce you could just attach|s.%--
fe004|whatever.|s
fe004|you could build up an appropriately uh appropriate structure according to the the sentence.|s
mn015|huh.|b
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|well this this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your c.   dot something.|s:s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|you know where where it's contextually dependent.|s^e
fe004|right.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|what is now?|qh
mn015|what was past?|qh
mn015|what is in the future?|qh
mn015|where is this?|qh
mn015|what is here?|qh
mn015|what is there?|qh
mn015|what is|qh.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|so time and space.|s
fe004|um we'll we'll get that on the other side a little like very minimally.|s
fe004|there's a sort there's a slot for setting time and setting place.|s
me010|good.|s^ba
fe004|and|fh
fe004|you know you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place.|s
fe004|and then there are many more interestingly linguistically anyway there are relative things that you know you relate the event in time and space to where you are now.|s
fe004|if there's something a lot more complicated like or so hypothetical or whatever then you have to do your job.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|like or somebody's job anyway.|s^e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|i'm going to point to at random.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|i mean i'm i'm curious about how much of the mental|s.%--
me045|i mean i'm not sure that the formalism sort of the grammatical side of things is going to have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff.|s^no
me045|you know um basically all of these so-called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of|s.%--
me045|i think of it as sort of giving you the coordinates of you know|s.%--
me045|assuming that at any point in discourse there's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios whatever and the speaker's supposed to be keeping track of those the um the construction that you actually get is just going to sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you've already got going um you're supposed to add structure to.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|so in france uh watergate wouldn't have hurt nixon or something like that.|s:s
me045|um well you say all right i'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past france universe or something like that.|s
me045|the information in the sentence tells you that much.|s
me045|but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is.|s
me045|so for example depending on the linguistic uh context it could be|s.%--
me045|like the question is for example what does watergate refer to there?|qh
me045|does it you know does it refer to um|qh.%--
me045|if you just hear that sentence cold the assumption is that when you say watergate you're referring to a watergate like scandal as we might imagine it happening in france.|s
me045|but in a different context oh you know if nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't you know watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the u. s.|s:s
me045|and in france it wouldn't have hurt him at all.|s:s
me045|now we're now that watergate we're now talking about the real one.|s
fe004|they're real right.|s^na|s^aa
me045|and the would sort of it's a sort of different dimension of hypothe-theticality right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|i see right.|s^na|s^aa
me045|we're not saying what's hypothetical about this world.|s^e:qw
me045|in the first case hypothetically we're imagining that watergate happened in france.|s
fe004|huh.|b
me045|in the second case we're imagining hypothetically that nixon had apologized right away.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|right.|b
me045|or something right?|s^e|qy^d^f^g
me045|so a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level.|s
me045|uh um and so|fh
me010|correct.|s^aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|i don't know where that sits then.|s^no
mn015|huh.|b
me045|sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant.|s^e
fe004|it seems like um the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals whatever give you sort of the the most|s.%--
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|those we i think we can figure out what the possibilities are right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|there are sort of a relatively limited number.|s^df
fe004|and then how they interact with some extra thing like in france or if such and such that's like there are certain ways that they they can|s.%--:s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|you know one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammar gives you.|s
fe004|i think.|s^bd
me045|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|but you know whatever.|s^bd
fe004|we we're|%-
me010|yeah in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going.|fg|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|uh i uh you you|%-
me045|but the whole point of the whole point of what fauconnier and turner have to say about uh mental spaces and blending and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence.|s
me045|you know there's not that much information contained in the sentence.|s
me045|it just says here.|s:s
me045|add this structure to this space.|s:s
me045|and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open.|s
me045|an individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on quote what the space configuration is at the time of utterance.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and so somebody's going to have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me i think.|s
me010|well|%-
me010|i think that's right.|s^na
me010|oh i yeah i uh uh i think that's not i|s.%--
me010|i don't think it's completely right.|s^nd
me010|i mean in fact a examples you gave in did constrain the meaning|s.%--
me010|the form did constrain the meaning.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|and so um it isn't uh|s.%-
me045|sure but like what what was the point of saying that sentence about nixon and france?|s^bk|qh^df
me045|that is not there is nothing about that in the in the sentence really.|s
fe004|that's okay.|s^bd
fe004|we usually don't know the point of the sentence at all.|s^df
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|but we know what it's trying to say.|s
fe004|we we know that it's what predication it's setting up.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|yeah.|b
me010|but but bottom line i agree with you.|s^na
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|that's all.|s^bd
me045|yeah.|b
me010|that that that we're not expecting much out of the uh|s^e.%-
fe004|purely linguistic cues right?|s^2|qy^d^f^g
me010|uh the purely form cues yeah.|s^m^na|s^aa
fe004|so|fh
fe004|huh.|b
me010|and um i mean you're you're the linguist.|fh|s^bd
me010|but uh it seems to me that these we we you know we've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something.|s
me045|yeah yeah.|b
me010|yeah i mean|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
me045|oh yeah.|s^aa
me010|uh i i mean that that's my feeling that that these are really hard uh problems that decide exactly what what's going on.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|okay.|s^bk
fe004|okay so um one other thing i just want to point out is there's a lot of confusion about the terms like profile designate focus et cetera et cetera.|fg|s^t^tc:s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh right right right.|s^aa
fe004|um for now i'm going to say like profile s often used|s.%--
fe004|like two uses that come to mind immediately.|s
fe004|one is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else.|s
fe004|so hypotenuse you profiled this guy against the background of the right right triangle.|s^e
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|and the second use um is in framenet.|s
fe004|it's slightly different.|s^rt
fe004|oh i was asking hans about this.|s
fe004|they use it to really mean um this in a frame this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required.|s
fe004|so they have to be there or expressed in some way.|s
fe004|which which i'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive.|s
fe004|but they're they're different meanings.|s
me010|right.|s^bk
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so the closest thing|s.%--
fe004|so i was thinking about how it relates to this notation.|s
fe004|for us um|s.%--
fe004|okay so how is it|fg|qw^t1.%--
fe004|so designate|s.%-
me010|does that is that really what they mean in in|qy.%-
fe004|framenet?|qy^2^bu^d
me010|framenet.|s^e
me010|i didn't know that.|s^no
fe004|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe004|i i mean i i was a little bit surprised about it too.|s^ba
fe004|i knew that|s.%--
me010|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|i thought that that would be something like|s.%--
fe004|there's another term that i've heard for that thing.|s
me010|right okay.|s^bk
fe004|but they i mean uh well at least hans says they use it that way.|s
fe004|and|fh
me010|well i'll check.|s^cc
fe004|and maybe he's wrong.|s
fe004|anyway so|fg
fe004|i think the the designate that we have in terms of meaning is really the highlight this thing with respect to everything else okay?|s^tc|qy^d^f^g
me010|right.|s^bk
fe004|so this is what what it means.|s
fe004|but the second one seems to be useful.|s
fe004|but we might not need a notation for it.|s^rt
fe004|we don't have a notation for it.|s
fe004|but we might want one.|s
fe004|so for example we've talked about if you're talking about the lexical item walk.|s:s
fe004|you know it's an action.|s
fe004|well it also has this idea it carries along with it the idea of an actor.|s
fe004|or somebody's going to do the walking.|s
fe004|or if you talk about an adjective red it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red.|s:s
fe004|so we used to use the notation with for this.|s^rt:s
fe004|and i think that's closest to their second one.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|so i don't yet know i have no commitment as to whether we need it.|s
fe004|it might be|s.%--
fe004|it's the kind of thing that a parser might want to think about whether we require|s^cs^rt.%--
fe004|you know these things are like it's semantically part of it.|s
me010|no no.|s^ar
me010|well uh critically they're not required syntactically.|s^nd
me010|often they're presupposed and all that sort of stuff.|s^e
fe004|right.|s^aa
fe004|right right yeah um definitely.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|in was a good example.|s:s
fe004|if you walk in like well in what?|qh^df^e
fe004|you know like you have to have the so so it's only semantically is it|s.%--
me010|right there's|s^aa|%-
fe004|it is still required say by simulation time though.|s
fe004|to have something.|s^e
me010|right.|s^aa
fe004|so it's that i meant the idea of like that the semantic value is filled in by simulation.|s
fe004|i don't know if that's something we need to to to like say ever as part of the requirement.|s^no^rt
fe004|or the construction.|s^bsc^rt
fe004|or not.|s^e
fe004|we'll we'll again defer.|s
me010|or i mean or or uh|%--
me010|so the|%-
fe004|have it construed.|s^bu
fe004|is that the idea?|qy^rt
me010|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe004|just point at robert.|s
fe004|whenever i'm confused just point to him.|s
me010|right.|s^aa^j
fe004|you tell me.|s
me010|it's it's his thesis right?|s^j|qy^d^f^g
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|anyway|fg
me010|right yeah   this is going to be a|s^bk|s.%--
me010|you're right this is a bit of in a mess.|s
me010|and we still have emphasis as well or stress or whatever.|s
fe004|okay well we'll get uh uh i we have thoughts about those as well.|s^bk|s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|great.|s^ba
fe004|um|fh
fe004|i i would|s.%--
fe004|some of this is just like my you know by fiat.|s
fe004|i'm going to say this is how we use these terms.|s
fe004|i you know there's lots of different ways in the world that people use it.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|i that's fine.|s^ba
fe004|i think that um the other terms that are related are like focus and stress.|s
fe004|so|%--
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|i think that the way i we would like to think uh i think is focus is something that comes up in i mean lots of|s.%--
fe004|basically this is the information structure.|s
fe004|okay it's like uh it's not it might be that there's a syntactic uh device that you use to indicate focus.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|or that there are things like you know|s.%--
fe004|i think keith was telling me things toward the end of the sentence post verbal tend to be the focused focused element.|s
me045|huh.|b
fe004|the new information.|s^e
fe004|you know if i i walked into the room you tend to think that whatever into the room is sort of like the more focused kind of thing.|s:s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|and when you uh uh you have stress on something that might be you know a cue that the stressed element or for instance the negated element is kind of related to information structure.|s
fe004|so that's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing.|s
fe004|uh so so i think that's kind of nice to keep focus being an information structure term.|s
fe004|stress|%--
fe004|i and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it.|s
fe004|so um like stress stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever like um accent kind of stress.|fh|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and that's just a|s.%--
fe004|uh we'll want to distinguish stress as a form device.|s
fe004|you know like oh high volume or whatever.|s^e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|uh and distinguish that from it's effect.|s
fe004|which is oh the kind of focus we have is we're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values right.|s:s|s^f
fe004|so focus carries along a scope.|s
fe004|like if you're going to focus on this thing and you want to know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't.|s
fe004|um so my classic my now classic example of saying oh he did go to the meeting.|s:qy^rt
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|that was my way of saying as opposed to you know oh he didn't or there was a meeting.|s^rt:qy^bu^d^rt
fe004|i think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|and so um the like if you said he|s.%--
fe004|you know there's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you're focusing whatever on uh|s.%--
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|he walked to the meeting as opposed to he ran.|s:s
fe004|or he did walk to the meeting as opposed to he didn't walk you know.|s:s|s^f
me045|uhhuh.|b.%
fe004|so we need to have a notation for that.|s^cs
fe004|which um|%--
fe004|i think that's still in progress.|s
fe004|so sort of i'm still working it out.|s^e
fe004|but it did one one implication it does have for the other side which we'll get to in a minute is that i couldn't think of a good way to say here are the possible things that you could focus on.|s
fe004|because it seems like any entity in any sentence you know or any meaning component of you know all the possible meanings you could have any of them could be the subject of focus.|s^df
me010|huh.|b
fe004|but i think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|so for instance you could say it's the the tense on this as opposed to um the the action okay.|s|s^f
fe004|or it's uh it's an identity thing or a contrast with other things.|s
fe004|or stress this value as opposed to other things.|s^e
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|it's it is kind of like a profile profile background thing.|s
fe004|but i i can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would that you would|s.%--
me045|light up with focus yeah.|s^2|s^aa
fe004|light highlight.|s^m^na
fe004|as opposed to other ones.|s^e
fe004|so it has some certain complications for the uh uh later on.|s
fe004|i mean uh the best thing i can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements.|s
fe004|for instance you oh one other type that i forgot to mention is like query elements.|s
fe004|and that's probably relevant for the like where is you know the castle kind of thing.|s:qw
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|because you might want to say that um location or certain w. h words bring you know sort of automatically focus in a you know i don't know the identity of this thing kind of way on certain elements.|s^df:s^no
fe004|so|fh
fe004|okay anyway so that's there are there are many more things that are that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation.|fg|s^rt
fe004|but it's most i think it's this is you know the current current form.|s
fe004|other things we didn't totally deal with um|s.%--
fe004|well we've had a lot of other stuff that keith and i have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective.|s
me045|oh there's a bunch.|s^ba
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|you know a a nominal expression.|s
fe004|and um|fh
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|i mean we should have put an example of this.|s^cs
fe004|and we could do that later.|s^cs
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|but i think the inherently like the general principles still work though.|s
fe004|that um we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like you know for instance one|s.%--
fe004|uh you know they they have constituents right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|so you can like nest things when you need to.|s
fe004|but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way.|s
fe004|so if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience then like this this might you know be a little opaque.|s
fe004|but you know we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent based grammar.|s
fe004|so that's i think that's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and so far it's worked out okay.|s
me010|good.|s^ba
fe004|so|fh
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|i can say two things about the|s.%-
fe004|yes.|s^bk
mn015|maybe you want to forget stress.|s^cs
mn015|this my|s.%-
fe004|as a word?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|no as as just don't don't think about it.|s^ar|s^cs
fe004|as a|%--
fe004|what's that?|qw^j
fe004|sorry.|s^fa
mn015|if|%-
mn015|canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence you can find out where a certain stress is.|s
mn015|and say hey that's my focus exponent.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|right.|b
mn015|it doesn't tell you anything what the focus is.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|if it's just that thing|s.%-
fe004|or the constituent that it falls in.|s
mn015|a little bit more or the whole phrase.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|um|%-
fe004|you mean forget about stress the form cue?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|the form bit.|s^na
me045|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|because uh as a form cue um not even trained experts can always well they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes.|s^df
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and that's also mostly true for read speech.|s
mn015|in in real speech um people may put stress.|s
mn015|it's so context dependent on what was there before phrase breaks um restarts.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|it's just um|s.%--
mn015|it's absurd.|s^ba
mn015|it's complicated.|s^e
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me045|yeah i mean i i'm sort of inclined to say let's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence.|fg|s^cs
mn015|and all|%-
fe004|i believe you yeah.|s^na|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and then|s.%-
fe004|ways that you can get it come from|s^2.%--
me045|hhh the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that.|s
fe004|right.|b
me045|you know i mean later on we'll worry about exactly how|s.%-
mn015|or or map from the contour to to what the focus exponent is.|s^bu
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|exactly.|s^aa
me045|but figure out how the|s.%--
me045|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|but uh if you don't know what you're what you're focus is then you're you're hopeless-uh-ly lost anyways.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|that's fine yeah.|s^ba|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and the only way of figuring out what that is is um by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and then you're left with a couple three.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so you know again that's something that humans can do.|s
mn015|um but far outside the scope of of any anything.|s
mn015|so|fh
mn015|you know|fh
mn015|it's|%--
fe004|okay well uh yeah i wouldn't have assumed that it's an easy problem in in absence of all the|s^bk|s.%--
fe004|you need all the other information i guess.|s^e
mn015|but it's it's what it uh it's pretty easy to put it in the formalism though.|s
mn015|i mean because|s^df.%-
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|you can just say whatever stuff is the container being focused or the the entire whatever both and so forth.|s
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|yeah exactly so the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture.|s^aa|s
me010|yeah so but i think the|fg|s.%--
me010|i'm not sure i understand.|s^bd^df^no
me010|but here's what i think is going on.|s
me010|that if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches it the fact that it matches does in fact specify the focus.|s
fe004|uh|%--
fe004|i'm not sure about that.|s^no
fe004|or it might limit it certainly constrains the possibilities of focus.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|uh uh at the very least it|s^na.%-
fe004|i think that's that's that's certainly true.|s
fe004|and depending on the construction it may or may not specify the focus right?|s^bu|qy^d^f^g
me010|oh uh for sure yes.|s^na|s^aa
me010|there are yeah it's not every but there are constructions uh where you explicitly take into account those considerations|s.%--
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so we talked about that a little bit this morning.|s
mn015|john is on the bus.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|not nancy.|s:s
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|so that's focuses on john.|s
me010|right.|b
mn015|john is on the bus and not on the train.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|john is on the bus versus john is on the train.|s:s
fe004|right.|b
mn015|and john is on the bus versus was and|s.%-
fe004|is on.|s^2
fe004|john is on the bus.|s^na
mn015|it's the so|s.%-
fe004|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|yeah all all of those.|s^aa|s^na
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|right.|b
mn015|all of these.|s^m^na
mn015|and will we have|qy.%--
mn015|is it all the same constructions?|qy^rt
mn015|just with a different focus constituent.|s^e
fe004|yeah i would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of|s^aa|s.%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|i don't know.|s^no
fe004|the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions.|s
fe004|so that's why i was talking about overlapping constructions.|s^rt
fe004|so then you have a separate thing that picks out you know stress on something relative to everything else.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so the question is actually|s.%--
fe004|and it would|s.%-
me010|oh i'm sorry.|s^fa
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|go ahead.|s^co
me010|finish.|s^co
fe004|and it and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as uh whether it picks up that element or the phrase or something like that.|s
fe004|but it's still is limited possibility.|s
mn015|huh.|b
fe004|so that should you know interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|the question is do we have a way on the other page uh when we get to the semantic side of saying what the stressed element was or stressed phrase or something?|qh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|well so that's why i was saying how|s.%--
fe004|since i couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it um all i can say is that information structure has a focused slot.|s^rt
me010|right.|b
fe004|and i think that should be able to refer to|s.%-
me010|so that's down at the bottom here when we get over there.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me010|okay.|s^bk
fe004|and infer and i don't have i don't have a great way or great examples.|s
me010|i'll wait.|s^cc
fe004|but i think that something like that is probably going to be uh more more what we have to do.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|huh.|b
fe004|but um|fh
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so|fh
fe004|okay that was one comment.|fg|s
fe004|and you had another one?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yeah well the once you know what the focus is the everything else is background.|s^aa|s
mn015|how about topic comment?|qh
mn015|that's the other side of information.|s
fe004|how about what?|qw^br^rt
mn015|topic comment.|s^rt
fe004|yeah so that was the other thing.|s^bk|s
fe004|and so i didn't realize it before.|s
fe004|it's like oh ! it was an epiphany that it you know topic and focus are a contrast set.|s:s
fe004|so topic is|s.%--
fe004|topic focused seems to me like um background profile okay?|s|qy^d^g
fe004|or a landmark trajector or something like that.|s
fe004|there's there's definitely um that kind of thing going on.|s
mn015|huh.|b
fe004|now i don't know whether|s^no.%--
fe004|i i don't have as many great examples of like topic indicating constructions.|s
fe004|on like focus right?|s^e|qy^d^g
fe004|um topic it seems kind of you know i think that might be an ongoing kind of thing.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me045|japanese has this though.|s
fe004|topic marker?|qy^bu^d
me045|you know|s.%--
me045|yeah that's what wa is.|s^aa|s:s
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|uh just to mark which thing is the topic.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|it doesn't always have to be the subject.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|so again information structure has a topic slot.|s
fe004|and you know i stuck it in thinking that we might use it.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|um i think i stuck it in.|s
me010|yep it's there.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|um and|fh
fe004|one thing that i didn't do consistently um is when we get there is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role.|s
fe004|i think i have an idea of what it should be.|s
fe004|but|%--
fe004|you know so far we've been getting away with like either a type constraint or um you know whatever.|s
fe004|i it'll be a frame.|s^rt
fe004|you know it'll be it'll be another predication or it'll be um i don't know some value from from something some variable and scope or something like that.|s
fe004|or a slot chain based on a variable and scope.|s
fe004|okay so well that's|fg|s^tc.%--
fe004|should we flip over to the other side officially then?|qy^rt^t^tc
mn015|uhhuh huh.|s^aa
fe004|i keep uh like pointing forward to it.|s
me045|okay side one.|s^bk|s
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|now we'll go back to|s.%--
fe004|okay so this doesn't include something which may have some effect on on it.|fg|s
fe004|which is um the discourse situation context record.|s
fe004|right so i didn't i i meant just like draw a line.|s^f|s
fe004|and like you know you also have uh some tracking of what was going on.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|and sort of this is a big scale comment before i you know look into the details of this.|s^bd
fe004|but for instance you could imagine instead of having|s.%--
fe004|i i changed the name of um it used to be entities.|s^rt
fe004|so you see it's scenario referent and discourse segment.|s
fe004|and scenario is essentially what kind of what's the basic predication.|s
fe004|what event happened.|s^e
fe004|and actually it's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture a bunch of frames and bindings right?|s|qy^d^f^g^rt
fe004|um and obviously there are other ones that are not included here.|s
fe004|general cultural frames and general like uh other action|s.%--
fe004|you know specific x. schema frames.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|okay whatever.|s^bk|s^bd
fe004|the middle thing used to be entities.|s
fe004|because you could imagine it should be like really a list.|s^df
fe004|where here was various information.|s
fe004|and this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh you know about some entity that you were going to talk about.|s
fe004|so harry walked into the room.|s:s
fe004|harry and room.|s
fe004|you know the room|s.%--
fe004|but they would be represented in this list somehow.|s
fe004|and it could also have for instance it has this category slot.|s
fe004|um it should be either category or or instance.|s
fe004|basically it could be a pointer to ontology.|s
fe004|so that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in.|s
fe004|but the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number gender.|s
fe004|um the ones i included here are slightly arbitrary.|s
fe004|but you could imagine that um you need to figure out|s.%--
fe004|if it's a group whether um some event is happening.|s
fe004|linear time linear spaces.|s
fe004|like you know are are they doing something serially.|s
fe004|or is it like|s.%--
fe004|um uh i'm i'm not sure.|fh|s^no
fe004|because this partly came from uh talmy's schema.|s^df
fe004|and i'm not sure we'll need all of these actually.|s
fe004|but|fh
fe004|um and then the status i used was like again in some languages you know like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status.|s
fe004|so the the big and and finally discourse segment is about sort of speech act y information structure y.|s
fe004|like utterance-specific kinds of things.|s
fe004|so the comment i was going to make about um changing entity the entity's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse|s.%--
fe004|like situation context|s^e.%--
fe004|you have a set of entities that you're sort of referring to.|s
fe004|and you might that might be sort of a general i don't know database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to.|s
fe004|and i changed to reference.|s
fe004|because i would say for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it.|s
fe004|and those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here.|s
fe004|for instance i know it's going to be plural.|s
fe004|i know it's going to be feminine or something like that.|s
fe004|and and these could actually just point to you know the the i. d in my other list of active entities right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|so um|fh
fe004|uh there's there's all this stuff about discourse status we've talked about.|s
fe004|i almost listed discourse status as a slot where you could say it's active.|s
fe004|you know there's this um hierarchy uh there's a schematization of you know things can be active or they can be um accessible inaccessible.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|it was the one that you know keith um emailed to us once to some of us.|s
fe004|not all of us.|s
fe004|and|fh
fe004|the thing is that that i noticed that that um list was sort of discourse dependent.|s
fe004|it was like in this particular set you know instance it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active.|s
me010|this|%--
me010|uh yeah well there there seems to be context properties.|fg|s
fe004|so|fh
fe004|yeah they're and for instance i used to have a location thing there.|s^aa|s
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|but actually that's a property of the situation.|s
fe004|and it's again time you know at certain points things are located you know near or far from you.|s
me010|well uh uh this is recursive.|s^nd
fe004|and|%-
me010|because until we do the uh mental space story we're not quite sure|s^df.%--
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|which is fine.|s^ba
fe004|yeah yeah.|s^bk
me010|we'll just we'll|s.%-
fe004|so some of these are uh|s.%-
me010|we just don't know yet.|s^no
fe004|right.|s^bk
fe004|so i so for now i thought well maybe i'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance right?|s|qy^d^g:s
fe004|everything else here is utterance-specific.|s
fe004|um and i left the slot predications open.|s
fe004|because you can have um things like the guy i know from school.|s^df
fe004|or you know like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded amounts of you know predications that you might make.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and it's unclear whether|s.%--
fe004|i mean you could just have in your scenario here are some extra few things that are true right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and then you could just sort of not have this slot here right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|you're but but it's used for identification purposes.|s
fe004|so it's it's a little bit different from just saying all these things are true from my utterance.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um|fh
me045|right this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean um there's a guy i know him from school.|fg|s:s
me045|and he came over for dinner.|s:s
me045|that's not the same effect.|s
fe004|yeah it's a little bit it's a little bit different.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|right so|s^f|%--
fe004|or maybe that's like a restrictive non restrictive|s.%--
fe004|you know it's like it gets into that kind of thing for|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|um but maybe i'm mixing you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence.|s
fe004|so you might imagine that the information you pass to you know in identifying a particular referent would be oh some you know it's a guy.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and it's someone i know from school.|s
fe004|so maybe that would you know be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the to the whatever construal engine or whatever discourse context to find you know either create this reference.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|in which case it'd be created here.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and|fh
fe004|you know so so you could imagine that this might not|s.%--
fe004|so uh i'm uncommitted to a couple of these things.|s
mn015|but to make it precise at least in my mind uh it's not precise.|s
fe004|um|fh
mn015|so house is gender neuter?|qw^rt
fe004|um it could be in|h|s.%-
mn015|in reality?|qy^d^rt
mn015|or in|qrr.%-
me010|semantically.|s
fe004|semantically yeah yeah.|s^m^na|s^aa
mn015|semantically.|s^bk^m
mn015|so|%-
fe004|so it uh uh a table.|s:s
fe004|you know a thing that doesn't have a gender.|s
fe004|so uh it could be that i mean|fg|s.%--
fe004|maybe you'd maybe not all these|s.%--
fe004|i mean i i would say that i tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things.|s
mn015|no just to make sure that we everybody that's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with uh form.|s^ar|s
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|okay that is semantic as opposed to|s^bk|s.%-
fe004|yeah yeah that's right.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|um|fh
fe004|so again|%-
mn015|then predications makes sense to to have it open for something like uh accessibility or not.|s
fe004|open to various things.|s^2
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|right.|b
fe004|okay so let's see.|s^bk|s
fe004|so maybe having made that big sort of like large scale comment should i just go through each of these slots uh each of these blocks um a little bit?|qy^rt^t^tc
me045|sure.|s^aa
fe004|um mostly the top one is sort of image schematic.|s
fe004|and just a note.|s
fe004|which was that um|s.%--
fe004|so when we actually|s.%--
fe004|so for instance um|s.%--
fe004|some of them seem more inherently static okay.|s|s^f
fe004|like a container or sort of support-ish.|s
fe004|and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic.|s
fe004|like source path goal is often thought of that way.|s
fe004|or force or something like that.|s
fe004|but in actual fact i think that they're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that.|s
fe004|and different x. schemas use them in a way that's either static or dynamic.|s
fe004|so path you could just be talking about the path between this and this.|s
me045|huh.|b.%
fe004|and you know container that you can go in and out.|s
fe004|all of these things.|s
fe004|and so um|fh
fe004|i think this came up when uh ben and i were working with the spaniards um the other day.|s
fe004|the spaniettes as we called them.|s^bsc
fe004|um to decide like how you want to split up like image schematic contributions versus like x. schematic contributions.|s
fe004|how do you link them up?|qh^e
fe004|and i think again um it's going to be something in the x. schema that tells you is this static or is this dynamic.|s
fe004|so we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that.|s^cs
fe004|um that you know is it uh a state or is it a change of state or is it a um action of some kind.|fg|s
mn015|uh is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't?|qy
fe004|uh|fh
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
mn015|just means|%-
fe004|oh oh you mean in the slot?|s^bk|qy^bu^d
mn015|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe004|um no it's like x. it's it's like i was thinking of type constraints.|s^ar|s
fe004|but x. schema well it obviously has to be an x. schema.|s
fe004|agent i mean the the performer of the x. schema.|s
fe004|that depends on the x. schema.|s
fe004|you know and i in general it would probably be you know|s.%-
me045|so the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were.|s^bu
fe004|yeah basically.|s^aa|s^na
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|um aspectual type probably isn't obvious.|s^bd
fe004|but i should have so i just neglected to stick something in perspective actor undergoer observer um|s^df.%-
me003|huh.|b
fe004|i think we've often used agent patient|s.%-
me045|whee!|s^fe
me045|that's that one right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
fe004|yeah exactly exactly.|s^aa|s^na
fe004|um and so one nice thing that uh we had talked about is this example of like if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is you know definitely it is one way to for you to you know specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object.|fh|s
fe004|and so then we talked about you know whether well does that specify topic as well?|qh
fe004|well maybe there are other things.|s
fe004|you know now that it's subject is more like a topic.|s
fe004|and now that you know|s.%--
fe004|anyway so|fg|%--
fe004|sorry i'm going to trail off on that one.|s^fa|s
fe004|because it's not that important right now.|s^df
fe004|um|fh
me010|now for the moment we just need the ability to write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules were.|s
fe004|to know how|s^2.%-
fe004|yeah yeah exactly.|s^aa|s^na
me010|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|um|fh
fe004|some of these other ones|s.%--
fe004|let's see.|s
fe004|so|fh
fe004|uh one thing i'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts.|s
fe004|so polarity uh is using for like action did not take place for instance.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so by default it'll be like true i guess.|s
fe004|you know if you're specifying events that did happen.|s
fe004|you could imagine that you skip out this you know leave off this polarity.|s
fe004|you know not don't have it here.|s
fe004|and then have it part of the speech act in some way.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|there's some negation.|s
fe004|but the reason why i left it in is because you might have a change of state let's say where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold.|s
fe004|and you're just talking you know|s.%--
fe004|if you're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that you know whatever the holder doesn't and|s.%-
me010|no i i think at this which is it should be where you have it.|s^ar|s
fe004|okay it's so it's it's it's fine where it is.|s^bk|s
fe004|so|fh
me010|i mean how you get it may may will often involve the discourse.|s^e
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|may come from a few places.|s^2
me010|but but by the time you're simulating you you should know that.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|right.|s^bk
me045|so i'm still just really not clear on what i'm looking at.|s^rt
me045|the scenario box.|s^rt
me045|like what does that look like for an example?|qh
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me045|like not all of these things are going to be here.|s^df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|correct.|s^aa
me045|this is just basically says|s.%-
fe004|it's a grab bag of|s.%-
me045|part of what i'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of uh schemas image and x. schemas.|s
me045|here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there.|s
fe004|so that's exactly what it is.|s^na
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|and for a particular instance which i will you know make an example of something is that you might have an instance of container and path let's say as part of your you know into you know definition.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so you would eventually have instances filled in with various various values for all the different slots.|s^rt
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and they're bound up in you know their bindings and and and values.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|it|%--
me045|do you have to say about the binding in your|qy.%--
me045|is there a slot in here for that tells you how the bindings are done?|qy^rt
me010|no no no.|s^ar
me010|i let's see i think we're we're not.|s
me010|i don't think we have it quite right yet.|s^no
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|so uh what this is|s.%--
me010|let's suppose for the moment it's complete.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|okay uh then this says that when an analysis is finished the whole analysis is finished you'll have as a result uh some resulting semspec for that utterance in context.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|which is made up entirely of these things and uh bindings among them.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and bindings to ontology items.|s^e
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that that the that this is the tool kit under out of which you can make a semantic specification.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so that's a.  .|s
me045|okay.|b
me010|but b.   which is more relevant to your life is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|so this is that anything you have in the party line anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes from pieces of this ignoring|s.%--
me045|okay.|b
me010|i mean in general you ignore lots of it.|s
me045|right.|b
me010|but it's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|uh so that the you know goal of the uh uh source path goal has to be the landmark of the you know the interior of this container.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|or whatever.|s^e
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so those constraints appear in constructions.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|except for cause that i forgot.|s^arp
fe004|but anyway there's some kind of causal structure for composite events.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|okay good.|s^bk|s^ba
me010|let's let's mark that.|s^co
me010|so we need a|s.%-
fe004|uh i mean so it gets a little funny.|s
fe004|these are all so far these structures especially from path and on down these are sort of relatively familiar um image schematic kind of slots.|s
fe004|now with cause uh the fillers will actually be themselves frames right?|s|qy^d^g
fe004|so you'll say event one causes event b.  .|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and and and and this this this again may our um and we and and of course worlds.|s
fe004|uh event two|s.%-
fe004|and|%-
fe004|yeah so that's uh these are all implicitly one within uh within one world.|s^aa|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|um|fh
fe004|even though saying that place takes place whatever.|s
fe004|uh if if i said time is you know past that would say set that this world you know somewhere before the world that corresponds to our current speech time.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so but that that that's sort of okay.|fh|s
fe004|the the within the event it's it's still one world.|s
fe004|um|fh
fe004|yeah so cause and|fg|s.%--
fe004|other frames that could come in i mean unfortunately you could bring in say for instance um uh desire or something like that.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|like want.|s^e
fe004|and actually there is right now under discourse segments um attitude.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|volition.|s^rt
fe004|could fill that.|s
fe004|so there are a couple things where i like oh i'm not sure if i wanted to have it there.|s^rt
me045|well that's|%-
fe004|or basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say talmy listed.|s
fe004|and like well i don't you know it was like hope wish desire.|s
me010|right.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|blah blah blah.|s^e
fe004|and it's like well i feel like if i wanted to have an extra meaning|s.%--
fe004|i don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place.|s^no
fe004|so they're more lexically marked right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|at least in english.|s^e
me045|huh.|b
fe004|so if i wanted to i would stick in an extra frame in my meaning saying.|s
fe004|so it'd be a hierarchical frame them right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|you know like naomi wants wants a certain situation.|s
fe004|and that situation itself is a state of affairs.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|so so want itself can be|s.%-
fe004|can be just another frame that's part of your.|s^2
me010|well and basically it's an action.|s
me010|in in our in our in our|s^e.%-
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|situation right right.|s^2|s^aa
me010|in in our in our terminology want can be an action.|s
me010|and what you want is a world.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me003|huh.|b
fe004|huh.|b
me010|so that's i mean it's certainly one way to do it.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|yeah there there are other things.|fh|s
me010|causal stuff we absolutely need.|s
me010|mental space we need.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|the context we need.|s
me010|um so anyway keith|fh|s.%--
me010|so is this comfortable to you?|qy
me010|that uh once we have this defined it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions.|s^e
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and then when we combine constructions semantically the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one.|s^e
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|and that's the and and i mean that according to the party line that's the whole story.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me045|um|fh|%--
me045|right that makes sense.|s^aa|s^na
me045|so i mean there's this stuff in the off in the scenario.|s
me045|which just tells you how various what schemas you're using.|s
me045|and they're how they're bound together.|s
me045|and i guess that some of the discourse segment stuff|s.%--
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|is that where you would|qy.%--
me045|i mean that's|s.%--
me045|okay that's where the information structure is.|s^bk|s
me045|which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of um of this.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|exactly.|s^aa
me045|i mean what's interesting is that the information structure stuff|s.%--
me045|huh.|s^ba
me045|there's almost i mean we keep coming back to how focus is like this this uh trajector-landmark thing.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|so if i say um you know in france it's like this.|s:s
me045|you know great.|s
me045|we've learned something about france.|s^e
me045|but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast.|s
me045|like in france it's like this.|s:s
fe004|right.|b
me045|and therefore you're supposed to say boy life sure|s.%--:s
me045|you know in france kids are allowed to drink at age three.|s
me045|and you're that's not just a fact about france.|s
fe004|right right.|b
me045|you also conclude something about how boring it is here in the u. s right?|s|qy^d^f^g
me010|right.|s^bk
me045|and so|fh
fe004|so i would prefer not to worry about that for right now.|s^bd^cs^rt
me045|okay.|s^bk
fe004|and to think that there are um|s.%--
me045|that comes in.|s
fe004|discourse level constructions in a sense topic topic focus constructions that would say oh when you focus something then|s.%--
me045|and uh|%-
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|just done the same way just actually in the same way as the lower level.|s
fe004|if you stressed you know john went to the you know the bar whatever you're focusing that.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and a possible inference is in contrast to other things.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so similarly for a whole sentence you know in france such and such happens.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me045|yeah yeah.|b
fe004|so the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible.|s
me045|yeah.|b
mn015|uh just just uh look read uh even semi formal mats rooth.|s
fe004|i mean|%-
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|if you haven't read it it's nice.|s
mn015|and just pick any paper on alternative semantics.|s^cs
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|so that's his that's the best way of talking about focus is i think his way.|s
me045|okay what was the name?|s^bk|qw^rt
mn015|mats.|s
mn015|m. a. t. s.|s^rt
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|rooth.|s
mn015|i think two o. 's.|s
mn015|yes t. h.|s^aa|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|i never know how to pronounce his name.|s
mn015|because he's sort of|s^df.%-
me010|swede?|qy^2^bu^d
mn015|uh he is dutch.|s
me010|dutch?|qw^br^m
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me010|oh dutch.|s^bk|s^m
mn015|and um but very confused background i think.|fh|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
mn015|so and um|fh
me045|mats gould.|s
mn015|and sadly enough he also just left the i. m. s in stuttgart.|s
mn015|so he's not there anymore.|s
me045|huh.|b
mn015|but um|fh
mn015|i don't know where he is right now.|s^no
mn015|but alternative semantics is if you type that into an uh uh browser or search engine you'll get tons of stuff.|s
me045|okay.|b
me045|okay.|s^bk
me045|okay thanks.|s^bk|s^ft
mn015|and what i'm kind of confused about is is what the speaker and the hearer is is sort of doing there.|s^tc
fe004|so for a particular segment it's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|so for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
fe004|um hearer is a little bit harder.|s^ba
fe004|it could be like multiple people.|s
fe004|i guess that that that that's not very clear from here.|s
fe004|i mean that's not allowed here.|s
mn015|yeah but you don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place?|s^bk|qy
mn015|because you me he they.|s^df
mn015|you know these guys|s.%--
mn015|all these expressions nuh are in in much the same way contextually dependent as here and now and there.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|now this is this is assuming you've already solved that.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me010|so it's it's fred and mary.|s:s
fe004|so|%-
me010|so the speaker would be fred.|s
me010|and the|%-
mn015|uh.|s^bk
fe004|right so the constructions might of course will refer using pronouns or whatever.|s^aa|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|in which case they have to check to see uh who the uh speaker in here in order to resolve those.|s
fe004|but when you actually say that he walked into whatever um the he will refer to a particular|s.%--
fe004|you you will already have figured who he or you huh or i maybe is a better example who i refers to.|s
fe004|um and then you'd just be able to refer to harry you know in wherever that person whatever role that person was playing in the event.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|that's up at the reference part.|s^bu
fe004|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn015|and down there in the speaker-hearer part?|qw^rt
fe004|so that's i think that's just|s.%--
fe004|for instance speaker is known from the situation right?|s|qy^d^f^g
fe004|you're when you hear something you're told who the speaker is.|s
fe004|i mean you know who the speaker is.|s
fe004|in fact that's kind of constraining how|s.%--
fe004|in some ways you know this before you get to the you fill in all the rest of it.|s
fe004|i think.|s
me010|huh.|b
fe004|i mean how else would you um|qh^df.%-
mn015|you know uh uh it's the speaker may in english is allowed to say i.|s:s
me010|yeah.|b
me010|well here|%-
fe004|yeah.|b
mn015|uh among the twenty five percent most used words.|s^e
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn015|but wouldn't the i then set up the the referent?|qh
fe004|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
mn015|that happens to be the speaker this time.|s^e
fe004|right right.|s^aa
mn015|and not they whoever they are.|s^e
fe004|so|%-
mn015|or you|%--
mn015|much like the you could|s.%-
fe004|so okay so i would say under referent should be something that corresponds to i.|fg|s
fe004|and maybe each referent should probably have a list of whatever the way it was referred to.|s
fe004|so that's i.|s
fe004|but uh uh should we say it it refers to what?|qh
fe004|uh if it were harry it would refer to like some ontology thing.|s:s
fe004|if it were if it's i it would refer to the current speaker.|s:s
fe004|okay which is given to be like you know whoever it is.|s
mn015|well not not always.|s^nd
mn015|i mean so there's and then he said i uhhuh|s.%-:s.%-
fe004|i within the current world.|s^df:s
me010|uh|%-
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|b.%
me010|that's right.|s^na
fe004|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
me010|so so again this uh this this is going to to get us into the mental space stuff.|fg|s
me010|and because you know fred said that mary said and whatever.|s^df:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|huh.|b
me010|and and so we're uh going to have to um chain those as well.|s^cs
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|twhhh-whhh.|b
mn015|but|fh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so this entire thing is inside a world.|s
me010|right.|b
fe004|not just like the top part.|s^e
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|i i think uh|%--
fe004|that's|%--
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|except it's it's trickier than that.|s^arp
me010|because um the reference for example|s^df.%--
me010|so where it gets really tricky is there's some things|s.%--
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|and this is where blends and all|s.%--
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|so some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't.|s
fe004|right.|b
me010|and again all we need for the moment is some way to say that.|s
fe004|right.|b
fe004|so i thought of having like for each referent having the list of of the things with which it is identified.|s
fe004|you know which which uh you know you you you|s.%--
me010|you could do that.|s^am
fe004|for instance um|s.%--
fe004|so i guess|s.%--
fe004|it sort of depends on if it is a referring if it's identifiable already or it's a new thing.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
fe004|if it's a new thing you'd have to like create a structure or whatever.|s
fe004|if it's an old thing it could be referring to um usually something in a situation right.|s|s^f
fe004|or something in ontology.|s^e
me010|uhhuh.|s^ba
fe004|so|fh
fe004|there's you know whatever it it could point at one of these.|s
me010|i just had a i just had an an idea that would be very nice if it works.|s
fe004|for what?|qw^br
fe004|if it works.|s
me010|uh uh uh i haven't told you what it is yet.|s
fe004|uhhuh huh.|s^bk
me010|this was my buildup.|s^df
me010|an an idea that would be nice|s.%-
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|okay we're crossing our fingers.|s^bk|s^cc
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|if it worked.|s
me003|so we're building a mental space good.|s^j
me010|yeah.|s^aa^j
fe004|okay.|s^bk^j
me010|right it was a space builder.|s^aa|s^rt
me010|um we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces.|fh|s
me010|because uh you have somewhat the same things going on of uh things being accessible or not.|s^df
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and so|%--
fe004|yep.|s^aa
me010|it it it uh i think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure.|s
fe004|use the same yep.|s^2|s^aa
me010|so that pulling something out of a discourse context is i think similar to other kinds of uh mental space phenomena.|s
me003|i see.|s^bk
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|and|%-
me010|uh i've i've i've never seen anybody write that up.|s^df
fe004|and|%-
me010|but maybe they did.|s^ba^df
me010|i don't know.|s^no
me010|that may be all over the literature.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|so so by default|s.%-
me045|there's things like you know there's all kinds of stuff like um in i think i mentioned last time in czech if you have a a verb of saying then|s.%--
me045|um you know you say something like or or i was thinking you can say something like oh i thought uh you are a republican or something like that.|s:s
me045|where as in english you would say i thought you were.|s:s
me010|right.|b
me045|um you know sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there.|s
me045|so you have to say something about you know tense is determined relative to current blah blah blah.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|same things happens with pronouns.|s
me045|there's languages where um|s.%--
me045|if you have a verb of saying then|s.%--
me045|uh|%--
me045|where|%--
me045|okay so a situation like bob said he was going to the movies where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking you're actually required to have i there.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|um and it's sort of in an extended function|s.%-
me010|uhhuh.|b
me010|so we would have it be in quotes in english.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|right.|b
me003|right.|b
me045|but it's not perceived as a quotative construction.|s
me045|i mean it's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing right?|s^e|qy^d^f^g
fe004|oh right yeah that makes sense.|s^aa|s^ba
me010|okay.|b
me045|um|fh
me045|but uh that happens to sound like the word for i.|s^rt:s^rt
me045|but is actually semantically unrelated to it.|s^rt
fe004|oh no!|s^fe
me010|oh good i love the|s^ba|%-
me045|um|fh
fe004|really?|qy^bh^rt
me045|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe004|you're kidding.|s
me045|there's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption.|s
me045|uh mary dalrymple.|s^e
me045|uh this book a ninety three book on uh on pronoun stuff.|s
fe004|no that's horrible.|s^ar|s^ba
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|that's horrible okay.|s^ba|s^bk
me045|well yeah and then the same thing for a. s. l.|fh|s
me045|where you know you're signing.|s
me045|and someone says something.|s
me045|and then you know so he say and then you sort of do a role shift.|s:s
me045|and then you sign i this that and the other.|s:s
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
me045|and you know i did this.|s:s
me045|that's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with i.|s:s
me045|and the role shift thing is completely left out and so on.|s
me045|so|fh
me045|i mean the point is that pronoun references uh you know sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on and so forth.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and so yeah i mean|s.%-
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me010|so that that that does sound like it's consistent with what we're saying yeah.|s|s^bk
me045|right.|s^aa
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|okay so it's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context.|s^bk|s^bu
fe004|and then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the you know depending on the construction or the whatever um you you you're scope is might extend out to the the base one.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|uhhuh.|b
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|it would be nice to actually use the same um mechanism.|s^cs
fe004|since there are so many cases where you actually need|s^df.%--
fe004|it'll be one or the other.|s^e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|it's like oh actually it's the same same operation.|s
me010|oh okay so this this is worth some thought.|s^bk|s
fe004|so|fh
me045|it's like it's like what's happening that yeah what's happening uh there is that you're moving the base space or something like that right?|s|qy^d^g
fe004|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me045|so that's that's how fauconnier would talk about it.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|and it happens under different circumstances in different languages.|s
me045|and so|fh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me045|um things like pronoun reference and tense which we're thinking of as being these discourse y things actually are relative to a bayes space.|s
me045|which can change.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|s^bk^rt
me045|and we need all the same machinery.|s^cs^e
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fe004|robert.|s
me010|well but uh this is very good actually.|s^ba
me045|schade.|s
me010|because it it it to the extent that it works it|s^df.%-
fe004|ties it all into it.|s^2
me010|it it ties together several of of these things.|s^m^na
fe004|yeah.|b
fe004|yep.|b.%
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and i'm sure going to read the transcript of this one.|s^j
mn015|so|fh
mn015|but the uh but it's too bad that we don't have a camera.|s
mn015|you know all the pointing is going to be lost.|s^df^e
fe004|oh yeah.|s^bk
me045|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|yeah that's why i said point to robert when i did it.|fg|s^df
me003|well every time nancy giggles it means it means that it's your job.|s^j
mn015|uh|fh
mn015|yeah.|b
mn015|huh isn't i mean i'm i was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality you know as your basic mental space.|s^ba|s^tc
mn015|and then builds up|s.%--
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|doesn't start with some because it's so it should be so obvious at least it is to me that whenever i say something i could preface that with i think.|s^df:s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|nuh?|qy^d^f^g
mn015|so there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|no but there's there's a gricean thing going on there.|s^ar|s
me010|that when you say i think you're actually hedging.|s
fe004|huh.|b
me045|yeah i mean|s^aa|s.%-
fe004|it's like i don't totally think.|s:s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
fe004|i mostly think uh|s^e.%-:s.%--
mn015|yeah it's absolutely.|s^aa|s^na
me045|yeah it's an it's an evidential.|s^aa|s
me045|it's sort of semi-grammaticalized.|s
me045|people have talked about it this way.|s
me045|and you know you can do sort of special things.|s
me045|you can|s.%-
me045|put just the phrase i think as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on and so forth.|s:s
fe004|actually one of the child language researchers who works with tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
me045|so|fh
fe004|and it was like it's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways.|s
fe004|just to mark you know uncertainty or something like that.|s^e
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|so|fh
mn015|yeah but about linguistic hedges.|fg|s
mn015|i mean those those tend to be um funky anyways.|s
mn015|because they blur|s^df.%-
me010|so we don't have that in here either do we?|s^bu|qy^g
me045|yeah.|s^ar
fe004|hedges?|qw^br
me010|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe004|hhh i there used to be a slot for speaker um|h|s.%--
fe004|it was something like factivity.|s^rt
fe004|i couldn't really remember what it meant.|s^df
fe004|so i took it out.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|but it's something|s.%--
me045|um|fg
me045|well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that right?|s|qy^d^g
fe004|we we were talking about sarcasm too right?|s|qy^d^g
fe004|oh oh.|s^bk
me045|i mean|%-
fe004|oh yeah yeah right.|s^aa
me045|that's what i think is.|s:s
me045|um sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this.|s^e
me010|so we probably should.|s^cs
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me045|or the you know|s.%-
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|confidence or something like that.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me045|and the fact that i'm you know the fact maybe if i think it versus he thinks that might you know depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me045|you know|fh
mn015|uh great word in the english language is called about.|s^tc:s
mn015|if you study how people use that it's also|s.%-
fe004|what's the word?|qw^rt
mn015|about.|s
me010|about.|s^bk^m
mn015|it's about|s.%-
me010|oh that in that use of about yeah.|s|s^bk
mn015|clever.|s^ba
fe004|oh oh oh as a hedge.|s^bk|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|and i think and i think if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get george started on that.|s^j
me045|he wrote a paper about thirty five years ago on that one.|s
me003|i i read that paper.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me003|the hedges paper?|qy^bu^d
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me003|i read some of that paper actually.|s
me045|would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti-lock brakes?|qy
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|what?|qw^br
me010|no.|s^ar
me045|ask me about it later.|s^co
me045|i'll tell you how.|s^cc
me045|when we're not on tape.|s^e
fe004|i'd love to know.|s
me003|oh man.|s^ba
fe004|so and and i think uh someone had raised like sarcasm as a complication at some point.|s
me010|there's all that stuff.|s^na
me010|yeah let's i i don't i think|fg|s^cs.%-
fe004|and|fh
fe004|we just won't deal with sarcastic people.|s
me010|yeah i mean|s^aa|%-
me045|i don't really know what like|s^no.%--
me045|we we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude right?|s|qy^d^g
me045|like there's not so many different|s.%--
fe004|certainly not as some|s^na.%--
me045|hhh i don't know|fh|s^no.%-
fe004|well they're intonational markers i think for the most part.|s
me045|yeah.|b
fe004|i don't know too much about the like grammatical|%-
me045|i just mean|%-
me045|there's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify and so on and so forth.|s
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|but like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes?|qh
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|right so uh this this raises the question of what are our current purposes?|s^aa|qh
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|right?|qy^d^g
fe004|oh yeah do we have any?|s^aa^j|qy^j^rt
me045|oh shoot.|s^ba
me045|here it is three fifteen already.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|yeah.|b
me010|uh so um|fh
me010|i i don't know the answer.|s^no
me010|but but um it does seem that|s.%--
me010|you know this is this is coming along.|s
me010|i think it's it's converging.|s
me010|it's as far as i can tell there's this one major thing we have to do.|s
me010|which is the mental the whole mental space thing.|s
me010|and then there's some other minor things.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|um and we're going to have to sort of bound the complexity.|s
me010|i mean if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know we'll go nuts.|s^df
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|so we had started with the idea that the actual uh constraint was related to this tourist domain.|s
me010|and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain|s.%--
me010|assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to|s.%--
me010|you know there's all sorts of god knows irony and stuff like|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
me010|which you isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide.|s
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah?|qy^d^f^g
me010|uh|fh
fe004|mockery.|s
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|whatever.|s^bd.x
me010|so|fg
me010|uh no end of things that that you know we don't deal with.|s
mn015|but it|%-
me010|and|fh
me010|go ahead.|s^co
mn015|isn't that part easy though?|qy
mn015|because in terms of the simspec it would just mean you put one more set of brackets around it.|s^df
mn015|and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony.|s^e
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|no.|s^ar
fe004|huh.|b
mn015|or|%--
me045|right.|s^aa
me010|no.|s^ar
fe004|maybe.|s^am
fe004|yeah in model theory because the semantics is always like speaker believes.|fg|s:s
me010|no.|s^ar
fe004|you know?|qy^d^f^g
fe004|like the speaker says p.   and believes not p..|s:s
me010|right.|b
me045|we have a theoretical model of sarcasm now.|s^na
fe004|but|fh
me045|yeah right i mean|s^bk|%--
fe004|right right but|s^aa|%-
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|no no.|s
me010|anyway so so um i guess|fg|%--
me010|uh let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that.|s
me010|which is that um|s.%--
me010|it was keith's uh sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions.|s
me010|uh and my suggestion to keith is that you over the next couple weeks|fh|s.%--
me045|huh.|b
me010|don't try to do them in detail or formally.|s
me010|but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have.|s^cs
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|uh and then when robert gets back we'll look at the set of them.|s
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|just just sort of you know define your space.|s^cs^e
me045|yeah okay.|s^bk
me010|and um so these are this is a set of things that i think we ought to deal with.|fh|s
me045|yeah.|s^bk
me010|and then we'll we'll we'll go back over it.|s^rt
me010|and people will will give feedback on it.|s
me045|okay.|b
me010|and then then we'll have a at least initial spec of of what we're actually trying to do.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|and that'll also be useful for anybody who's trying to write a parser.|s^df
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|knowing uh|%--
me045|in case there's any around.|s^bd^j
fe004|if we knew anybody like that.|s^bd^j
me010|right.|s^aa^j
me010|who might|s^e.%--
me010|et cetera.|s
me010|so uh|fh
me045|okay.|b
me010|so and we get this this uh portals fixed.|s
me010|and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range.|s
me010|and then of course nancy you're going to have to uh do your set of|s.%--
me010|but you have to do that anyway.|s^bd
fe004|for the same yeah data yeah uhhuh.|s^na|s^aa
me010|so so we're going to get we're basically dealing with two domains.|s
me010|the tourist domain and the and the child language learning.|s
me003|huh.|b
me010|and we'll see what we need for those two.|s^rt
me010|and then my proposal would be to um not totally cut off more general discussion.|s^cs
me010|but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we've we really want to get done.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|and then as a kind of separate thread think about the more general things and and all that.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
mn015|well i also think the detailed discussion will hit you know bring us to problems that are of a general nature.|s^df
me010|uh without doubt.|s^na
mn015|and maybe even|s.%-
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|but what i want to do is is is to to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for.|s^df
mn015|even suggest some solutions.|s^e
mn015|yeah.|b.%
mn015|huh.|b.%
me045|uhhuh.|b.%
me010|so that that we say these are the things we're really going to try do by the end of the summer.|s^df:s
me010|and other things we'll put on a list of of research problems or something.|s
me010|because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done.|s^df
me010|because every time you start to do something you say oh yeah but what about this case.|s:qh
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|this is this is called being a linguist.|s^j
mn015|huh.|b
me045|yeah.|s^aa
me010|and uh|fh
me045|basically.|s^na
fe004|or me.|s^na
me010|huh?|qw^br
fe004|or me.|s^r
fe004|anyways.|s^bd
me003|there's that quote in jurafsky and martin where where it goes where some guy goes every time i fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up.|s:s
me010|right.|b
fe004|yeah.|s^bk
me045|exactly.|s^bk
me010|right.|b
me010|but anyway|s^bd.%--
me010|so is is that does that make sense as a uh a general way to proceed?|qy
fe004|sure yeah.|s^aa
me045|yeah yeah we'll start with that.|s^aa|s
me045|just figuring out what needs to be done.|s
me045|then actually the next step is to start trying to do it.|s
me010|exactly right.|s^na
me045|got it.|s^bk
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|huh.|b
me045|okay.|s^bk
mn015|we have a little bit of news uh just minor stuff.|s^rt
mn015|the one big|s.%-
me003|ooo can i ask a|fg|qy.%-
me045|you ran out of power.|s
mn015|huh?|qw^br
me003|can i ask a quick question about this side?|qy
fe004|yes.|s^aa
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me003|is this uh was it intentional to leave off things like inherits?|qy
me003|and|fh
fe004|oops.|s^fa
fe004|um|h
me045|no.|s^ar
fe004|not really.|s^nd
fe004|just on the constructions right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
me003|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|um|fh
me003|like constructions can inherit from other things.|s^bu
me003|am i right?|qy^rt
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me003|yeah.|s^bk
fe004|i didn't want to think too much about that for for now.|s
me003|okay.|s^bk
fe004|so uh maybe it was subconsciously intentional.|s^rt
me010|yeah.|b
me010|yeah uh|fg
me045|um yeah there should be i i wanted to find out someday if there was going to be some way of dealing with uh if this is the right term multiple inheritance.|s
me010|yeah.|b
me045|where one construction is inheriting from uh from both parents.|s
me010|uhhuh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe004|yep.|s^aa
me045|uh or different ones.|s^e
me045|or three or four different ones.|s^e
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|yeah.|b
me045|because the problem is that then you have to|s^df.%--
me010|so let me|s.%-
fe004|refer to them.|s^2
me045|which of you know which are how they're getting bound together.|s^e
me010|yeah right right right.|s^aa
fe004|yeah and and there are certainly cases like that.|s^aa|s
me010|yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe004|even with just semantic schemas we have some examples.|s
me010|right.|s^bk
fe004|so|fh
fe004|and we've been talking a little bit about that anyway.|s
me010|yeah so what i would like to do is separate that problem out.|fg|s^cs
fe004|inherits.|s
me010|so um|fh
me045|okay.|s^bk
me010|my argument is there's nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more constructions.|s
me045|yeah yes.|s^bk
me010|it's uglier and it doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff.|s^ba^bd^df
me045|that's right.|s^aa
me010|uh|fh
me045|but whatever.|s^bd
fe004|uh those are over rated.|s^na
me045|yeah no no no no.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me045|no by all means.|s^aa|s^na
me045|right uh sure.|s^bk
me010|and so i what i'd like to do is is in the short run focus on getting it right.|s
me010|and when we think we have it right then saying aha.|s:s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|can we make it more elegant?|qh
me045|yeah that's|s^bk|%-
me045|yeah.|b
me010|can can we uh what are the generalizations and stuff?|qh^e
me045|connect the dots.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|but rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we're doing.|s^df
me045|yep.|b
me045|yeah.|b
me010|so i would say in the short run we're not going to|s.%--
me045|yeah.|b
me010|first of all we're not doing them yet at all.|s
me010|and and it could be that half way through we say aha.|s:s^fe
me010|we we now see how we want to clean it up.|s
me045|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh and inheritance is only one i mean that's one way to organize it.|fh|s
me010|but there are others.|s
me045|yeah.|b
me010|and it may or may not be the best way.|s
me010|i'm sorry.|s^fa^tc
me010|you had news.|s
mn015|huh.|b
mn015|oh just small stuff.|s^bk|s^bd
mn015|um thanks to eva on our web site we can now|fh|s^ft.%--
mn015|if you want to run javabayes uh you could see get download these classes.|s^rt
mn015|and then it will enable you|s.%--
mn015|she modified the gui so it has now a a a button menu item for saving it into the embedded javabayes format.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
me003|huh.|b
mn015|so that's wonderful.|s^ba^rt
me010|great.|s^ba
mn015|and um and she you tested it out.|s
mn015|do you want to say something about that that it works right?|qy
fn050|i was just checking like when we want to um get the posterior probability of like variables.|s^rt
mn015|with the|%-
fn050|you know how you asked whether we can like just observe all the variables like in the same list?|qy^d
fn050|you can't.|s
fn050|you have to make separate queries every time.|s^df
mn015|uhhuh.|b
mn015|okay that's that's a bit unfortunate.|s^bk|s^ba
fn050|so|fh
fn050|yeah.|b
mn015|but|fh
mn015|for the time being it's it's it's fine to do it|s.%-
fn050|you just have to have a long list of you know all the variables.|s
mn015|yeah.|b
fn050|basically.|s^e
mn015|but uh|fh
fe004|uh all the things you want to query you just have to like ask for separately.|s^bu
fn050|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn015|well that's probably maybe in the long term that's good news.|s
mn015|because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how how we want to get an output.|s^df
mn015|um but that's a different discussion for a different time.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|i don't know.|s^no
mn015|we're really running late.|s
mn015|so i had uh an idea yesterday.|s
mn015|but uh i don't know whether we should even start discussing.|s^no
me010|what|%-
me010|yeah sure tell us what it is.|s^aa|s^co
mn015|um the construal bit that um has been pointed to but hasn't been um made precise by any means um may may work as follows.|h|s
mn015|i thought that we would uh|s.%--
mn015|that the following thing would be incredibly nice.|s^df
mn015|and i have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing.|s^df
mn015|so that's just a tangent a couple of mental disclaimers here.|s
mn015|um imagine you you write a bayes-net.|fh|s
mn015|um|fh
fe004|bayes?|qw^br^d^m
mn015|bayes-net.|s^m^na
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|um completely from scratch every time you do construal.|s
mn015|so you have nothing.|s
mn015|just a white piece of paper.|s
me010|huh.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|you consult consult your ontology.|s
mn015|which will tell you a bunch of stuff and parts and properties uhuh uh|s.%-
fe004|grout out the things that that you need.|s^2
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|then you'd simply write uh these into onto your your white piece of paper.|s
mn015|and you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there.|s
mn015|you won't get you won't really get any c. p. t.'s.|s^df
mn015|therefore we need everything that that configures to what the situation is.|s
mn015|i. e the context dependent stuff.|s
mn015|so you get whatever comes from discourse.|s^rt
mn015|but also filtered.|s
mn015|uh so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse.|s^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn015|plus the situation and the user model.|s
mn015|and that fills in your c. p. t.'s with which you can then query um the the net that you just wrote.|s
mn015|and find out how thing x.   is construed as an utterance u.  .|s:s
mn015|and the embedded javabayes works exactly like that.|s
mn015|that once you|s.%--
mn015|we have you know precise format in which to write it.|s^rt
mn015|so we write it down.|s
mn015|you query it.|s
mn015|you get the result.|s
mn015|and you throw it away.|s
mn015|and the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it.|s
mn015|you may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what so that will allow you to craft the the the initial notes.|s
mn015|but it's in that respect it's completely scalable.|s
mn015|because it doesn't have any prior um configuration.|s^df
mn015|it's just you need an ontology of the domain.|s
mn015|and you need the context dependent modules.|s
mn015|and if this can be made to work at all that'd be kind of funky.|s
me010|um it sounds to me like you want p. r. m.'s.|fg|s
mn015|p. r. uh p.r.|s.%--
mn015|i mean since you can unfold a p. r. m into a straightforward bayes-net.|s^df
me010|because it because|s^df.%-
me010|no no you can't.|s^ar|s
me010|see the the critical thing about the p. r. m is it gives these relations in general form.|s
me010|so once you have instantiated the p. r. m with the instances and then you can then you can unfold it.|s
mn015|then you can.|s^2
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|s^bk
mn015|no i was using it generic.|s^ar|s^df
mn015|so uh probabilistic whatever relational models|s.%--
mn015|whatever you write it|s.%--
me010|well no but it matters a lot.|s
mn015|in|%-
me010|because you what you want are these generalized rules.|s^df
me010|about the way things relate|s^e.%--
me010|that you then instantiate in each case.|s^e
mn015|and then then instantiate them.|s^2
me010|yeah and that's|s^aa|%-
mn015|that's maybe the the way the only way it works.|s^am
me010|yeah that's the only way it could work.|s^aa|s^aap
me010|i we have a our local expert on p. r. m.'s.|s
me010|uh but my guess is that they're not currently good enough to do that.|s
me010|but we'll we'll have to see.|s
me010|uh|fh
mn015|but uh|%--
me010|yes.|s^bk
me010|this is that's that would be a good thing to try.|s^ba^cs
me010|it's related to the hobbs abduction story.|s
me010|in that you you throw everything into a pot.|s
me010|and you try to come up with the uh|s.%-
mn015|except there's no no theorem prover involved.|s^arp
fe004|best explanation.|s^2
me010|no there isn't a theorem prover.|s^ar|s
me010|but there but but the um the the the p. r. m.'s are like rules of inference.|s
me010|and you're you're coupling a bunch of them together.|s
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|b
me010|and then instead of proving you're trying to you know compute the most likely.|s
me010|uh|fh
me010|tricky.|s^ba
me010|but you yeah it's a good it's a it's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal.|s^cs
mn015|what's it?|%
me010|so are you going to write something for us before you go?|qy^rt
mn015|yes.|s^aa
mn015|um|fh
me010|oh you have something.|s^bu
mn015|in the process thereof or whatever.|s^aap
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so what's what when are we going to meet again?|qw
fe004|when are you leaving?|qw
fe004|thursday?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|uh|s.%--
fe004|friday?|qy^bu^d^e^rt
mn015|thursday's my last day here.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|so|fh
mn015|i would suggest as soon as possible.|s^cs
mn015|do you mean by we the whole gang?|qy^rt
me010|no i didn't mean just the two of us.|s^ar|s
me010|we obviously we can we can do this.|s
me010|but the question is do you want to for example send the little group uh a draft of your thesis proposal?|qy
me010|and get uh another session on feedback on that.|s^e
me010|or|fh
mn015|we can do it thursday again.|s^cs
mn015|yeah.|s^bk
me045|fine with me.|s^ba^na
me045|should we do the one p. m time?|qy^cs
me045|for thursday since we were on that before!|s^d^fe
me045|or|qrr.%--
mn015|sure.|s^aa
me045|okay.|s^bk.%
me010|all right.|s^bk
fn050|huh.|b
mn015|thursday at one?|qy^bu^d
mn015|i can also maybe then sort of run through the uh the talk i have to give at e. m. l.|s^cs
mn015|which highlights all of our work.|s^cs^e
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and we can make some last minute changes on that.|s
me010|okay.|s^bk
me003|you can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper.|s^cs^j^rt
me010|that'll tell him exactly what's going on.|s^na
me010|yeah that|%-
fe004|can we do can we do one thirty?|qy
me010|all right.|fg
mn015|no.|s^ar
fe004|oh you already told me no.|s^bk|s:s
fe004|one.|s
mn015|but we can do four.|s^cs^rt
fe004|okay it's fine.|s^bk|s^ba
fe004|i can do one.|s^ba^ng
fe004|it's fine.|s^ba
fe004|it's fine.|s^ba^r
mn015|one or four.|s^cs
mn015|i don't care.|s^bd
me045|to me this is equal.|s^na
me045|i don't care.|s^bd
mn015|if it's equal for all?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|what should we do?|qw
fe004|yeah it's fine.|s^aa|s^ba
fe004|fine.|%
mn015|four?|qy^d^rt
fe004|yeah|s^aa.%--
fe004|no no no uh i don't care.|s^ar^bsc|s^bd
fe004|it's fine.|s^ba
mn015|it's equal to all of us.|s^df
mn015|so you can decide.|s
mn015|one or four.|s^e
me003|the pressure's on you nancy.|s
mn015|liz actually said she likes four.|s
mn015|because it forces the meeting recorder people to cut you know the discussions short.|s^df
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|okay four.|s^bk|s
fe004|okay?|qy^bu^d
fe004|okay i am.|s
me045|well if you insist then.|s^ba^j
fe004|why?|z
me003|i'm known i|z
fn050|um.|z
fe004|no because she already told me it before she told you.|z
me003|no she told me a long time ago she told me she told me like two weeks ago.|z
fe004|oh well it doesn't matter what time.|z
mn015|okay.|z
mn015|you know how to toggle the display width function|z
fn050|wow.|z
fe004|well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet.|z
fe004|anyway.|z
fn050|what is it?|z
me003|let me explain something to you.|z
fn050|um|z
me003|my laugh is better than yours.|z
fn050|there.|z
mn015|yo.|z
fe004|i beg to differ.|z
fn050|um okay.|z
fe004|but you have to say something genuinely funny before you'll get an example.|z
me003|yeah.|z
fn050|the thing is i don't know how to get to the next page here.|z
me003|no.|z
me003|you should be at least be self satisfied enough to laugh at your own jokes.|z
fn050|actually i thought|z
fn050|there.|z
fe004|no it's a different laugh.|z
fn050|how weird.|z
fe004|ooh wow!|z
me003|oh holy mackerel.|z
fe004|wow whoa!|z
fn050|what?!|z
fn050|oh.|z
fn050|okay i|z
fn050|wasn't even doing anything okay.|z
fe004|uh.|z
me003|eva's got a laptop she's trying to show it off.|z
fn050|that was actually robert's idea but anyhow.|z
fn050|um|z
me010|okay so here we are.|fg|s^t^tc
me003|once again.|s^2
me010|once again.|s^m
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|together.|s
me010|um so we haven't had a meeting for a while.|fh|s
me010|and and probably won't have one next week.|s^e
me010|i think a number of people are gone.|s^df
me010|um so robert why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with e d u?|fh|qh^co^t
mn015|um|h
mn015|uh in a in a smaller group we had uh talked and decided about continuation of the data collection.|s^rt
mn015|so fey's time with us is almost officially over.|s
mn015|and she brought us some thirty subjects and collected the data.|fh|s
mn015|and ten dialogues have been transcribed.|s
mn015|and can be looked at.|s^rt
mn015|if you're interested in that talk to me.|s^co^rt
mn015|um and we found another uh cogsci student who's interested in playing wizard for us.|fh|s
mn015|here we're going to make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects uh this round.|s
mn015|she's actually suggested to look um at the psychology department students.|s^cs
mn015|because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements.|s^df
mn015|so they have to be subjected before they can actually graduate.|s^df^e
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time.|s
mn015|two days for example.|s^e
mn015|to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time.|s^e
mn015|and|fh
mn015|um sort of package the whole thing in a in a in a few more complicated um structure.|fh|s^e
mn015|that's for the data collection.|s^rt
mn015|as for smartkom i'm the last smartkom meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis.|s
mn015|which as of this morning should be resolved.|s^rt
me010|good.|s^ba
mn015|and so|fh
mn015|should be means they aren't yet.|s:s
mn015|but but i think i have the info now that i need.|s^rt
mn015|plus johno and i are meeting tomorrow.|s
mn015|so maybe uh uh when tomorrow is over we're done.|s^am
mn015|and we'll never have to look at it again.|s
mn015|maybe it'll take some more time.|s^am
mn015|to be realistic.|s^e
mn015|but at least we're we're seeing the end of the tunnel there.|s
mn015|that was that.|s^rt^tc
mn015|um|fh
mn015|the uh|%--
mn015|uh i don't think we need to discuss the formalism.|fh|s
mn015|that'll be done officially once we're done.|s^df^rt
mn015|um|fh
mn015|something happened in on eva's side with the p r m that we're going to look at today.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|we have a visitor from bruchsal from the international university.|s^rt
mn015|andreas i think you've met everyone except nancy.|s
fe004|sorry.|fg
mn059|yeah.|s^aa
fe004|hi hi.|s
mn015|hi hi.|s^m
mn015|and um|fh
fe004|so when you said andreas i thought you were talking about stolcke.|s
fe004|now i know that we aren't.|s
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn015|andy you actually go by andy.|s^bu
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn059|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|oh okay.|s^bk
mn059|because there is another andreas around.|s
mn015|uh|fh.%
fe004|huh.|b
mn059|so to avoid some confusion.|s
mn015|that will be reuter?|qy^bu^rt
mn059|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|oh okay.|s^bk
mn015|so my scientific director of the e m l is also the dean of the international university.|s
mn015|one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied.|s
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|the|%--
mn015|um he might tell us a little bit about what he's actually doing.|fh|s^t
mn015|and why it is somewhat related.|s
mn015|and by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using.|s^df
mn015|and um was that enough of an update?|fh|qy^rt
me010|i think so.|s^aa
mn015|in what order shall we proceed?|qy^t^tc
fn050|okay.|s
mn015|maybe you have your online|s^cs.%--
fn050|uh|h
fn050|yeah sure.|s^aa
fn050|um so i've just been looking at um|fg|s.%--
fn050|ack!|s^fe
fn050|what are you doing?|qh
fn050|yeah.|b
fn050|okay.|fh
fn050|um|fh
fn050|i've been looking at the p r m stuff.|s
fn050|um|fh
fn050|so this is sort of like the latest thing i have on it.|s
fn050|and|fh
fn050|i sort of constructed a couple of classes.|s
fn050|like a user class a site class and and you know a time a route and then and a query class.|s^e
fn050|and i tried to simplify it down a little bit.|s
fn050|so that i can actually um look at it more.|s^df
fn050|it's the same paper that i gave to jerry last time.|s
fn050|um|fh
fn050|so basically i took out a lot of stuff a lot of the decision nodes.|s
fn050|and then tried to|s.%--
fn050|the red lines on the um graph are the um relations between the different um classes.|s
fn050|like a user has like a query.|s
fn050|and then also has you know um reference slots to its preferences.|s
fn050|um the special needs and you know money and the user interest.|fh|s^e
fn050|and so|fh
fn050|this is more or less similar to the flat bayes net that i have you know with the input nodes and all that.|s
fn050|and|fh
fn050|so i tried to construct the dependency models.|s
fn050|and|fh
fn050|a lot of these stuff i got from the flat bayes net.|s^rt
fn050|and what they depend on.|s^e^rt
fn050|and it turns out you know the c p t's are really big if i do that.|s^df
fn050|so i tried to see how i can do um put in the computational nodes in between.|s
fn050|and what that would look like in a p r m.|s^e
fn050|and so i ended up making several classes.|s
fn050|actually you know a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes.|s^bc
fn050|and one of them is like time affordability money affordability site availability and the travel compatibility.|s^e
fn050|and so some of these classes are|s.%--
fn050|some of these attributes only depend on stuff from say the user.|s^rt
fn050|or just from i don't know like the site.|s^e
fn050|like um these here.|s
fn050|it's only like user.|s^e
fn050|but if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors you need to look at a pair of you know what the um preference of the user is.|s
fn050|versus you know what type of an event it is.|s^e
fn050|or you know which form of transportation the user has.|s^e
fn050|and whether you know the onsite parking matters to the user in that case.|s^e
fn050|and that makes the scenario a little different in a p r m.|fh|s
fn050|because um then you have one user objects.|s^df
fn050|and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind.|s
fn050|and so|fh
fn050|for each of the site you'll come up with this rating of travel compatibility.|s
fn050|and they all depend on the same users but different sites.|fh|s
fn050|and that makes a|s.%--
fn050|i'm i i have been trying to see whether the p r m would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that.|s
fn050|and so|fh
fn050|i guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat bayes net.|s
fn050|because otherwise you would|s^df.%--
fn050|well it's probably the same.|s
fn050|but um|fh
fn050|no you would definitely have|s.%--
fn050|be able to re use like um all the user stuff.|s^bc
fn050|and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff.|s
fn050|because it's all from the user side.|s^df
fn050|so if you changed sites you you can you know save some work on that.|s
fn050|but|fh
fn050|you know in the case where it depends on both the user and the site then i'm still having a hard time trying to see how um using the p r m will help.|s
fn050|um so anyhow using those intermediate nodes then this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes.|fh|s
fn050|and that would basically it's just another class in the model.|s
fn050|with you know references to the user and the site and the time.|s^e
fn050|and then after you group them together this|s.%--
fn050|the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this.|s
fn050|and so you know it's easier to specify the c p t and all.|s
fn050|um so i think that's about as far as i've gone on the p r m stuff.|fh|s
me010|well|s^ar.%--
fn050|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|no.|s^ar^rt
me010|so you didn't yet tell us what the output is.|s^df
fn050|the output.|s^m
me010|so what decisions does this make?|qw
fn050|okay so it only makes two decisions in this model.|fg|s
fn050|and one is basically how desirable a site is.|s
fn050|meaning um how good it matches the needs of a user.|s^e
fn050|and the other is the mode of the visit.|s
fn050|whether it's the e v a decision.|s^e
fn050|um|fh
fn050|so instead of um doing a lot of you know computation about you know which one site it wants of the user wants to visit i'll come well try to come up with like sort of a list of sites.|s^cc^rt
fn050|and for each site you know where how how well it fits.|s
fn050|and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it.|s
fn050|so|fh
fn050|anything else i missed?|qy^t
me010|so that was pretty quick.|s
me010|she's uh uh eva's got a little write up on it.|s
me010|that uh probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them.|s
me010|um|fh
me010|so|fh
me010|the you you didn't look at all yet to see if there's anybody has a implementation?|qy^bu^d
fn050|no not yet.|s^aa
fn050|um|fh
me010|okay.|s^bk
me010|so one so one of the questions you know about these p r m's is|s.%--
fn050|uhhuh.|b^rt
me010|uh we aren't going to build our own interpreter.|h|s^cc
me010|so if if we can't find one then we uh go off and do something else and wait until one appears.|s^cs
me010|uh so one of the things that eva's going to do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down.|fh|s
me010|uh|fh
me010|the people at stanford write papers as if they had one.|s
me010|but um we'll see.|fh|s^am
me010|so anyway so that's a a major open issue.|s
me010|if there is an interpreter it looks like you know what eva's got should run.|s
me010|and we should be able to actually um try to solve you know the problems.|s
me010|to actually take the data and do it.|s^e
me010|uh and we'll see.|fh|s^am
me010|uh i actually think it is cleaner.|s
me010|and the ability to instantiate you know instance of people and sites and stuff um will help in the expression.|s
me010|whether the inference gets any faster or not i don't know.|s^no
me010|uh it wouldn't surprise me if it if it doesn't.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
me010|you know it's the same kind of information.|s
me010|i think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief net.|s
me010|uh without going to some incredible hacking.|fh|s^e
me010|of sort of rebuilding it on the fly.|s^e
me010|i mean the notion of instantiating your elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief net.|s
me010|so that was one of the main reasons for doing it.|s^df
me010|um|fh
me010|i don't know.|s^tc
me010|so uh people who have thought about the problem like robert|fh|s.%--
me010|it looked to me like if eva were able to come up with a you know value for each of a number of uh sites plus its e v a thing.|s^cs
me010|that a travel planner should be able to take it from there.|s^e
me010|and you know with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever.|fh|s
me010|and then plan a route.|s
mn015|uhhuh um well first of all uh uh great looks much cleaner.|s
mn015|nnn nnn|%
mn015|certain certain beauty in it.|s
mn015|so um if beauty is truth then uh we're in good shape.|s
mn015|but|fh
mn015|the um|%--
mn015|as uh mentioned before we probably should look at the details.|s^cs
mn015|so if you have a write up then uh i'd love to read it.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
mn015|and uh|fh
mn015|because um|s.%--
mn015|can you go all the way back to the the very top?|qy^rt
fn050|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|um uh these these when these are instantiated they take on the same values that we had before?|fh|qy^rt
fn050|i can't really see the whole thing.|s^t3
mn015|or are they have they changed in a sense?|qrr
fn050|well i think i basically leave them to similar things.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fn050|some of the things might that might be different maybe like are that the hours for the site.|s
mn015|huh|b
fn050|and eventually i meant that to mean whether they're open at this hour or not.|fh|s
fn050|and status would be you know more or less like whether they're under construction.|s:s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
fn050|and and or stuff like that.|fh|s
mn015|and the uh other question i would have is that presumably from the way the stanford people talk about it you can put the probabilities also on the relations.|s
mn015|if|%-
fn050|which is the structural uncertainty?|qy^bu^rt
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah i that's|fg|%--
me010|that i think was actually in the previous the ubenth stuff.|s
me010|i don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not.|s^no
fe004|huh|b
me010|uh structural uncertainty.|fh|s
mn015|it's sort of in the definition or in the in daphne's definition of a p r m.|s
mn015|is that classes and relations.|s^e
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn015|and you're going to have c p t's over the classes and their relations.|s^e
me010|all right.|fg
mn015|more uncertainty or or|s.%-
me010|uh|fh
fn050|i remember them learning when you know you don't know the structure for sure.|s
mn015|i should say|s.%-
me010|yeah.|b
fn050|but i don't remember reading how you specify.|s^no
me010|right.|b
mn015|yeah that would be exactly my question.|s
fn050|to start with.|s^e
fn050|yeah.|b
mn015|well|fh
me010|yeah.|b
fn050|yeah.|b
me010|so uh the the plan is is when daphne gets back we'll get in touch.|s^cc
me010|and supposedly um we'll actually get deep seriously connected to to their work.|s
me010|and|fh
mn015|yep.|s^aa
me010|somebody will uh you know if it's a group meeting once a week probably someone will go down and whatever.|s^cs
me010|so we'll actually figure all this out.|s^cc
mn015|okay.|s^bk
mn015|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn015|then i think the long term perspective is is pretty clear.|s
mn015|we get rocking and rolling on this again once we get a package.|s^co
mn015|if when and how.|s^e:qw
mn015|then this becomes foregrounded.|s
fn050|uhhuh.|b
mn015|profiled.|s^e
mn015|focused again.|s^e
me003|designated?|qy^rt
fe004|of course.|s^aa
mn015|and um|fh
mn015|until then we'll come up with a something that's that's way more complicated for you.|s^cc^rt
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fn050|okay.|s^aa
mn015|because this was laughingly easy.|s^df
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fn050|actually i had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff.|s^ng
fn050|because i i made it really complicated in the beginning.|s^df
fn050|and jerry was like this is just too much.|fh|s:s
me010|yeah so um|fg
me010|you could from this go on and say suppose there's a group of people traveling together.|s^cs
me010|and you wanted to plan something that somehow with some pareto optimal uh uh thing for|fh|s.%-
fe004|that's good.|s^ba
fe004|that's definitely a job for artificial intelligence.|s^j
me010|uh or|%-
mn015|well that's not not even something humans|s^na.%-
fe004|except for humans can't really solve it either so.|s
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|right.|b
me010|well that's the that would that would be a uh you could sell it as a|s^cs^j.%--
fe004|yeah.|b
me010|okay uh you don't have to fight about this just give your preferences to the|s.%--:s
fe004|and then you can blame the computer.|s
me010|exactly.|s^aa
mn015|huh|b
fe004|so|fh
mn015|but what does it uh would a potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again?|qw^j^rt
mn015|you know.|b
fe004|that should be one of them.|s^j^na
mn015|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah right.|s^aa
me003|that'd be nice.|s^ba
fe004|huh|b
me010|anyway.|fg
me010|so so there there are some some uh you know uh elaborations of this.|s
me010|that you could try to put in to this structure.|s^cs^e
me010|but i don't think it's worth it now.|s
me010|because we're going to see what what else uh what else we're going to do.|s^df
me010|anyway.|s^tc
me010|but uh|fh
me010|it's good yeah.|s^ba
me010|and and there were a couple other ideas of of uh things for eva to look at.|s
me010|in in the interim.|s^e
mn015|good then we can move on and see what andreas has got out his sleeve.|fg|s^t^tc
mn015|or andy for that matter.|s^e
mn059|okay so uh uh well thanks for having me here first of all.|fg|s^ft
mn059|um so maybe just a a little background on on my visit.|fh|s
mn059|so uh i'm not really involved in any project that's uh that's relevant to you uh at the moment.|s
mn059|uh the the reason is really for me uh to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field.|s
mn059|and and so i'll just sort of give you a real quick introduction to what i'm working on.|s
mn059|and um i just hope that you have some comments.|fh|s
mn059|or maybe you're interested in it to find out more.|s
mn059|and and so i'll be uh happy to talk to you.|s
mn059|and and uh i'd also like to find out some more.|s
mn059|and and maybe i'll just walk around the office.|s
mn059|and|fh
mn059|and then and ask some some questions uh in a couple days.|s
mn059|so i'll be here for uh tomorrow and then uh the remainder of uh next week.|s
mn059|okay so um what i started looking at uh to begin with is just uh content management systems uh in general.|s
mn059|so|fh
mn059|um uh what's uh sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects.|s
mn059|um and you store meta data uh associate to them.|s
mn059|so there's some international standards.|s
mn059|like the i triple e uh there's an i triple e l o n standard.|s^e
mn059|and um these fields are pretty straightforward you have uh author information you have uh size information format information and so on.|s
mn059|uh but they're two uh fields that are um more interesting.|s
mn059|one is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document.|s^e
mn059|and one is uh you have sort of a um|s^e.%--
mn059|well what is the document about so it's some sort of taxonomic uh ordering of of the of the units.|s
mn059|now if you sort of put on your semantic glasses uh you say well that's not all that easy.|s
mn059|because there's an implicit um uh assumption behind that.|s^df
mn059|is that uh all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh whichever taxonomy is used.|s^e
mn059|and uh|fh
mn059|i think that's a that's a very that's a key point of these systems.|s
mn059|and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that.|s
mn059|and uh as a matter of fact the only thing that apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes.|s
mn059|which are very very coarse grain.|s^e
mn059|so you have some like science biology and then|s.%--
mn059|but that's really all that we have at the moment.|s
mn059|so i think there's a huge um uh need for improvement there.|s
mn059|now what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um sort of uh with a search engine just query uh different repositories all over the world.|s
mn059|but we can't really|s.%--
mn059|um so what i'm what i try to do is um to have um|fh|s.%--
mn059|uh so so the scenario is the following you're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem.|s
mn059|now what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh students um try to program a certain assignment for example.|s^df
mn059|they always run into the same problems.|s^df^e
mn059|uh and they always come running to us.|s^df^e
mn059|and they'll say why's it not it's not working.|s^df^e
mn059|and we always give out the same answer.|s^df^e
mn059|so we thought well it'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this.|s:s
mn059|and so what i want to build is basically a a smart f a q system.|s
mn059|now what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information.|s^co
mn059|which is more elaborate than i'm looking for this and this and this keyword.|s^e:s
mn059|so|fh
mn059|and i think that i don't need to tell you this.|s
mn059|i'm i'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain uh context.|s
mn059|it and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference.|s
mn059|so i want to be able to model information like um so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems of at a computer science school.|fh|s^cs
mn059|um what kind of software is the person using.|fh|s:qw
mn059|which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment.|s:qw
mn059|um maybe what's the background of that student's.|s:qw
mn059|um which um which error message was encountered.|fh|s:qw
mn059|so this sort of information i think should be transmitted uh when a certain document is retrieved.|s
mn059|now|fh
mn059|um|fh
mn059|basically giving this um uh|s.%--
mn059|so we somehow need to have a formalized um way of writing this down basically.|s^cs
mn059|and that's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again.|s
mn059|and using this and some some uh knowledge about the domain i think you can do some some simple inferences.|fh|s
mn059|like you know that when somebody's working about uh working on on servlets for example.|s
mn059|he's using java because servlets are used are written in java.|s^e
mn059|so some some inferences like that.|s
mn059|now um using this you can infer more information.|fh|s
mn059|and you could then match this to the meta data of um off the documents you're you're searching against.|s^cs
mn059|so uh what i want to do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs.|s^cs
mn059|and then i can compute how many documents match.|s^rt
mn059|and use this as a metric in the search.|s
mn059|now what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results.|s^cs
mn059|and i want to do this by having a depth uh um um steepest descent approach.|s
mn059|so if i knew which operating system the person was working on would this improve my search result.|s:qw
mn059|and and having uh uh a symbolic formalized model of this i could simply compute that.|s
mn059|and find out which um which questions are worth um asking.|s
mn059|and that's what i then propagate back to the user.|s
mn059|and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way.|s
mn059|now the big problem that i'm facing right now is um it's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly that that works in the small domain.|s
mn059|but the problem is obviously the scalability.|s
mn059|and uh uh so robert was mentioning uh earlier today is that uh microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a bayesian network.|fh|s
mn059|which does exactly this.|s^e
mn059|but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend.|s
mn059|and so uh what i'm what i try to do is basically try to model this uh in a way that you could really combine uh knowledge from very different sources.|s
mn059|and and um sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh came up with.|fh|s
mn059|trying to to have uh an approach how to integrate uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules.|s
mn059|um what you can do with those.|s^e
mn059|um|fh
mn059|what i'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this.|s
mn059|because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure.|s^df
mn059|so it's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh computational model.|s^ba
mn059|that that probably isn't expressive enough.|s^e
mn059|so so that's another thing.|s
mn059|um which i think you're also uh uh looking into right now.|s^rt
mn059|and then um uh sort of as an add on to this whole idea um uh that would be|s.%--
mn059|now depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which um uh which uh rules and which ontologies it it uses or basically its view of the world uh you can get very different results.|s^df
mn059|so it might make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines.|s
mn059|and there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach.|s
mn059|where we're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves.|s^e
mn059|and um if you have a question about a homework it's probably makes sense to ask somebody who's in your class with you sort of the guru in the certain area.|s
mn059|rather than going to some yahoo like uh search engine.|s^e
mn059|so these are some of the just in a nutshell some of the ideas.|s
mn059|and i think a lot of the even though it's a it's a very different domain but i think a lot of the um issues are are fairly similar.|s
mn059|so|fh
mn059|okay.|s^rt^tc
fe004|and so some of the i don't know how much you know about the larger heidelberg project.|s
fe004|i are you|qy.%-
mn059|uh i know yeah i know about it.|s
fe004|so it seems like a lot of some of the issues are the same.|s
fe004|it's like um you know the context based factors that influence how you interpret|s.%--
mn059|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
fe004|um how to interpret|fh|s.%--
fe004|in in this case in knowing wanting to know what kinds of things to ask.|s
fe004|we've kind of talked about that.|s
fe004|but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe004|but maybe you guys had that in the previous models.|s
mn015|well in a in one one huh small difference in a in a way is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer.|s
mn015|but he wants to point to the places|s.%-
mn059|yeah so so i'm i'm not i'm not building an expert.|fg|s
fe004|documents that have the answers.|s^2
mn059|uh i want to build a smart librarian basically.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn059|that can point you to the right reference.|s^e
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn059|i don't want to compute the answer.|s
mn059|so it's a little bit easier for me.|s^ba
mn015|well uh you have to still understand what the content says about itself and then match it to what you think the informational needs.|s^ng
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn059|uhhuh.|b
fe004|so you also don't have to figure out what the content is.|s^bu
fe004|you're just taking the keywords as a topic text.|s^bu
mn059|i i assume that that there will be learning systems that that tag their their content.|s^na
fe004|as|%-
fe004|okay.|s^bk
mn059|and um um|fh
fe004|right.|s^bk
mn059|and basically what i what i envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an f a q for example you could state sort of like a logic condition when this document applies.|s^cs
mn059|so this document explains how to set up your uh mail account on linux or something like this.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
mn059|so so something something very specific that you can then|s.%--
mn059|but the i think that the key point with these uh learning systems is that uh a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries.|s
fe004|huh.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn059|you can have the best learning system with the best search interface.|s
mn059|if there's no content inside of it it's not very useful.|s
mn059|so i think ultimately because um uh developing these these rules and these inference uh inferences i think is very costly.|s
mn059|so um uh i think you must be able to reuse some some existing um domain domain information or or or ontologies that that uh other people wrote.|fh|s^cs
mn059|and then try to integrate them.|s^e
mn059|and then also search the entire web basically rather than just the small uh content management system.|s^e
fe004|okay.|b
fe004|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn059|so i think that's that's crucial for for the success of or|s.%-
fe004|so you're not|s.%--
fe004|i guess i'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we've talked about in this group and actually associated groups.|s
mn059|uhhuh.|b
fe004|because some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses.|s^df
fe004|and i'm guessing that you you won't be doing that.|s^bu^rt
mn059|no.|s^aa
fe004|okay.|s^bk
fe004|just checking.|s^df
fe004|so okay|fh
mn015|huh|b
mn059|no.|s^aa^r
fe004|so you take the query and and|s.%--
me010|on the other hand uh framenet could well be useful.|s^cs
me010|so do you know the framenet story?|qy^rt
mn059|um yeah.|h|s^aa
mn059|uh not not too much.|h|s^aap
me010|okay.|s^bk
mn059|but uh|%--
me010|oh that's another thing you might want to look into while you're here.|s^cs
mn059|i have a rough overview.|s^e
me010|because um you know the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames and the frames may well give you additional keywords.|s^df
me010|or uh if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords uh indicate a frame then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame rather than just uh individual|s.%--
mn059|huh huh|b
me010|so there's a lot of stuff.|s
me010|and people are looking at that.|s
me010|most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right.|s
me010|there's linguists and stuff.|s^e
me010|and there's a lot of it.|s^e
me010|and they're they're busily working away.|s
me010|but there are some application efforts trying to exploit it.|s
me010|and this looks it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that.|s^cs
mn059|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn059|yeah i'm sure i could learn a lot about um yeah just how to how to come up with these structures.|s
fe004|huh|b
mn059|because it's it's very easy to whip up something quickly.|s
mn059|but it maybe then makes sense to to me but not to anybody else.|s
mn059|and and if we want to share and integrate things they must well they must be well designed really.|s
mn015|remember the uh prashant story?|qy^d^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|the absolutely no no linguistic background person that the i u sent over here.|s^e
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|and andreas and i tried to come up or we had come up actually with a uh with him working on an interface for framenet as it was back then that would do some of the work for this machine.|s^e
me010|right.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|b
mn015|which uh never got done because prashant found a happy occupation.|s^e
me010|yeah i know i mean it it he he did what what he did was much more sensible for him.|s
mn015|which in the|s^e.%-
me010|i think uh|s.%-
mn015|absolutely yeah.|s^aa
mn015|but so i'm just saying the uh we had that idea.|s
me010|you know|fg
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|the idea was there yeah okay.|s^aa
mn015|uh to to exploit framenet there as well.|s^e
me010|yeah.|b
fe004|huh|b
mn015|and um|fh
me010|yeah actually you guys never|s.%-
mn015|and srini's doing information extraction also.|s^bu
mn015|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|right.|s^aa
mn015|with that framenet base.|s^e
mn059|huh|b
me010|yeah.|b
me010|so you you guys never sent anybody else from i u.|s
mn015|uhhuh.|b
me010|you were no|s.%-
mn059|except except prashant?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|uh this was supposedly an exchange program.|fh|s
mn059|um|fh
me010|and i we you know it's fine we don't care.|s
me010|but it just i'm a little surprised that uh andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send.|s
me010|all right.|b
mn059|uh i don't know i mean the uh|s.%-
me010|i mean i had forgotten i to be honest with you i'd totally forgotten we had a program.|s
fe004|huh|b
mn015|uh it's in the program?|qy^d^rt
mn059|uh i i think it's it's really the lack of students uh at i u at the moment.|s^df
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah.|fg
me010|no no there was a whole there was a little contract signed.|s
me010|it was|%--
me010|yeah.|b
mn059|yeah yeah i think it's it's more the lack of of students really.|s^df^r
mn059|and we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams.|s^df^e
me010|yeah i know.|s^bk
fe004|huh|b
me010|right.|s^aa
mn059|but|fh
me010|right.|b
mn059|well i mean if if i were a student i'd love to come here rather than work for some german company or|s.%--
me010|yeah.|b
me010|right.|b
mn015|you are being recorded right now so beware.|s^co
me010|oh right!|s^fe
mn059|well i didn't say anybody to anything to offend.|s
mn059|well except for the sponsors maybe.|s^e
mn059|but|fh
me010|right.|b
me010|anyway.|b
me010|right so i that's that's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you're here.|s^cs
mn059|uhhuh.|b
me010|uh unfortunately srini who is heavily involved in daml and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town.|fh|s
mn059|uhhuh.|b
mn059|well i'll go to the uh semantic web workshop uh in two weeks.|s^cc
me010|right.|s^bk
me010|and|fh
me010|yeah for for some reason he's not doing that.|s
fe004|yeah.|s^aa
me010|i don't know why he|s^no.%--
fe004|well he had other things to do.|s^df
me010|oh i who knows?|qh
me010|yeah you'll see you'll certainly see a lot of the people there.|s
fe004|the uh|%-
fe004|the other person i thought of is dan gildea.|s^cs^rt
fe004|because he did some work on topic spotting|s^df.%-
me010|yeah.|s^aa
me010|statistical stuff.|s^2
me010|that would be a very good idea.|s^ba
fe004|um which is i mean you i mean i don't depending on how well you want to integrate with that end|fh|s.%--
mn059|uhhuh.|b
fe004|you know like taking the data and you said the learning systems that figure out|s.%--
fe004|we there's someone in icsi who actually has been working on has worked on that kind of stuff.|s^df
fe004|and he's worked with frame net.|s^df
fe004|so you could talk to him about you know both of those things at once.|s
mn059|uhhuh uhhuh|b
fe004|so|fh
fe004|and he just finished writing a draft of his thesis.|s^e
fe004|so|fh
mn059|so uh who is that again?|qw^rt
fe004|dan gildea g i l d e a.|s
fe004|and he's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff.|s^e
mn015|who?|qw^rt
mn015|i can take you to his office.|s^cc
mn015|it's just around the corner.|s
fe004|and|fh
mn059|okay great.|s^bk
fe004|huh|b
fe004|well if you solve the problem hope you can do one for us too.|s
me010|all right was there anything else for this?|fg|qy^rt^t
me010|one of these times soon we're going to hear about construal.|s
mn015|yeah i'm sure.|s^aa
mn015|i have um i think it was november two thousand three or some|s.%--
mn015|no i had something in my calendar.|s
me010|oh okay right.|s^bk
mn015|um|fh
me003|wait a second.|s^co
me003|that's a long way away.|s^df
me010|good thinking!|s^ba^fe
mn015|uh well maybe i can i can bribe my way out of this.|s^j
mn015|so|fh
mn015|so i did some double checking.|s
mn015|and it seems like spring break in two thousand one|s.%-
fe004|talk about changing the topic.|s^j
mn015|no.|s^ar
me010|well no but he's he's he's he's as you said he's like the state legislature he's trying to offer us bribes.|s^df^ng
fe004|at least this is a private meeting.|s^df
fe004|right exactly.|s^aa
fe004|okay that's the link.|s
mn015|this uh oh they refused the budget again?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|is it so about citris?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn015|yeah still nothing.|s^e
me010|uh this this this the|h|s.%--
me010|we're uh involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh program.|s
me010|uh with the state of california.|fh|s^e
me010|and the state of california is now a month and a half behind its its legally required date to approve a budget.|s^df
me010|so the budget has not been approved.|s
me010|and two days ago there's two you know so two branches of legislature one branch approved it.|s
mn059|uhhuh.|b
me010|and um|fh
me010|yesterday day there was this uh uh i thought that the other branch would just approve it.|s
me010|but now there's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there.|s
me010|uh anyway.|s
me010|so um|fh
me010|oh i have to tell you a wonderful story about this.|s^cc
me010|okay?|qy^d^g^rt
me010|and then we'll go.|s^cc
me010|so i it turns out i wound up having lunch today with a guy named tom kalil.|s
me010|k i l l.|s^e
me010|k a l i l.|s^bsc
me010|and uh he now works at berkeley.|fh|s
me010|in fact he's hired to run a lot of citris.|s
me010|even though we don't have the money they so they've been hiring people right and left.|s^e
me010|so uh they think the money's coming.|fh|s
me010|so and he was i think the chief staffer to clinton on technology matters.|s
me010|he was in the white house.|s^e
me010|i don't remember what he was saying.|s^no
me010|anyway like that.|s
me010|and is now doing all the politics for citris.|s
me010|but also has a uh a lot of interest in uh actually doing things for society.|s
me010|so digital divide and stuff like that.|s^e
me010|so that's interesting to me but maybe not to you.|s
me010|but the really interesting thing was he he he said something about you know i'm interested in things that have high social multiplier.|s:s
me010|something that is of great social value.|s^e:s
me010|he said for example|s.%--:s
me010|this was his only example.|s
me010|if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor.|s:s
me010|and as compelling as a video game.|s^e:s
me010|then that would have a huge social impact.|s^e:s
me010|i said oh great that's a good problem to work on.|s:s
me010|anyway so it was nice that uh he's got this view of a that's what you should try to do and b   uh language would be a good way to do it.|fh|s^ba:s
me010|so that's|s.%-
fe004|huh definitely.|s^aa
me010|so anyway that's the end of the story.|s
fe004|but for adults and not for the children.|s
me010|this was|%--
me010|yeah i didn't push him on the on the child thing.|s^na
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|but uh|fh
me010|you know again if if you if you|s.%--
fe004|oh.|s^bk
me010|um|fh
me010|and this was this was literacy.|s
me010|which actually is somewhat different problem.|s^e
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|maybe easier.|s^am
me010|i don't know.|s^no
me010|so this is reading rather than teaching.|s
me010|another project we started on and and didn't get funded for was uh to try to build an automatic tutoring program for kids whose first language wasn't english.|s
me010|which is like half the school population in california.|s^e
me010|something like that.|s^e
me010|isn't it?|qy^d^g^rt
fe004|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
me010|yeah.|s^bk
me010|so|fh
me010|enormous problem in california.|s
me010|and the idea was if we're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding couldn't we build uh programs that would be tutors for the kids.|fh|s^cs
me010|we think we could.|s
me010|anyway so so but this is a slightly different problem.|s
fe004|uhhuh.|b
me010|and|fh
me010|um|fh
me010|i know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now.|s
me010|but it it's it's interesting.|s^e
me010|and i may um talk to him some more about is somebody already doing this and stuff like that.|s:qy
me010|so anyway that was that was today's little story.|s^tc
me003|huh|b
mn015|okay so i i did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into citris.|fg|s
me010|no no.|s^ar
mn015|but uh or temporarily putting it out of the sling.|s^bsc
me010|right.|b
mn015|but i i'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that i am uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings.|s
me010|yeah.|s^aa
mn015|and also revising|s^e.%--
mn015|thanks for all the comments.|s^ft
mn015|the the original construal proposal.|s^e
mn015|and if i put one and one together i may end up with a number that's greater than one and that i i can potentially present once you get back.|s
fe004|greater than two?|qy^bu^d^rt
me010|you're good.|s^ba
mn015|nnn sometimes you know the sum is not uh less than the|s^nd.%-
fe004|uh right right.|s^aa
me010|right.|b
me010|right.|b
me010|anyway yeah so okay so that'd be great.|fg|s^ba
me010|but i'd i think it's it's time again.|s
me010|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn015|absolutely yeah.|s^aa
me010|yeah okay.|s^bk
mn015|but um and hopefully all sidetracking um other things will have disappeared soon.|s
me010|good.|s^bk
me010|yep.|s^bk
me010|done?|qy^d^rt
me013|starts|z
me013|no.|z
fe016|no.|z
me013|no.|z
fe016|that's a different thing.|z
me013|there's another|z
me013|i don't know.|z
me013|it starts with a p or something.|z
me013|i forget the word for it but it's it's um|z
fe016|oh.|z
me013|typically when you you're starting around forty for most people.|z
me013|it starts to harden and then it's just harder for the lens to shift things.|z
fe016|oh.|z
me013|and the the symptom is typically that you you have to hold stuff uh uh further away to to see it.|z
mn005|uhhuh.|z
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|in fact uh my brother's a gerontological psychologist.|z
me013|and he he uh came up with an an uh a uh body age test which uh gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough statistical predictors of all the rest of it.|z
me013|and one of them is is the distance that you have to hold it at.|z
fe016|give someone a piece of paper and then they oh.|z
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|yeah.|z
me011|we're we're live by the way so we've got a good intro here.|z
me013|oh yeah.|z
me013|about how old i am.|z
me013|okay.|z
me011|yep.|z
me011|we can edit that out if you want.|z
fe016|oh that's optional.|z
me013|no that's okay.|z
mn005|uhhuh.|z
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe016|you know?|z
me011|so this time the form discussion should be very short.|s^bu
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|it also should be later.|s^e
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|because jane uh is not here yet.|s^df
me011|good point.|s^ba
me013|and uh she'll be most interested in that.|s
me013|uh she's probably least involved in the signal processing stuff.|fh|s
me013|so maybe we can just just uh|s.%--
me013|i don't think we should go though an elaborate thing.|s^cs
me013|but um uh jose and i were just talking about the uh uh speech energy thing.|s
mn005|the two last|s^2.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and i uh|s.%--
me013|we didn't talk about the derivatives.|s
me013|but i think you know the the|s^cs.%--
me013|if i can if you don't mind my my speaking for you for a bit um uh|s^cs.%--
me013|right now that he's not really showing any kind of uh distinction but uh|s.%--
me013|but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at.|s^rt
me013|um and uh one is that uh this is all in log energy.|fh|s
me013|and log energy is basically compressing the distances uh between things.|s
me013|um another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal sizes.|s
me013|he was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds.|s
me013|uh and uh he's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows as we discussed before.|fh|s
me013|um and uh and the other thing is that the yeah doing the subtracting off the mean and the variance in the uh and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain may not be the right thing to do.|fh|s
mn005|hi.|s^t3
me011|hi jane.|s^t3
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|we just started.|s
me011|could you take that mike there?|qy^rt
fe016|are these the long term means?|qy^bu^rt
fe016|like over the whole|s^e.%--
fe016|i mean the means of what?|qy^d
me013|uh between between|s.%-
fe016|all the frames in the conversation?|qy^d^rt
me011|thanks.|s^ft
fe016|or of things that|qrr^d.%--
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|between|s.%--
me013|neither.|s^ar
mn005|no.|s^ar
me013|it's uh between the pauses uh for some segment.|s
fe016|oh.|s^bk
me013|and so his his he's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds.|s
fe016|oh.|s^bk
me013|and so you take that.|s
me013|and then he's he's uh measuring at the frame level.|s
me013|still at the frame level of what|s.%--
fe016|right.|b
me013|and then and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount.|s
me013|um and but one thing he was pointing out is when he he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain it is actually pretty hard to see the change.|s^rt
me013|and you can sort of see that because of of just putting it on the board that if you sort of have log x plus log x that's the log of x plus the log of two.|s^rt
mn005|yep.|b
fe016|yeah maybe it's not log distributed.|fg|s^cs
mn005|huh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and it's just you know it it diminishes the effect of having two of them.|s
fe016|but you could do like a c d f there instead?|qy
me013|um|fh
fe016|i mean we don't know that the distribution here is normally|s^df.%--
me013|yes right.|s^bk
me013|so so what i was suggesting to him is that|s.%--
fe016|so just some kind of a simple|s^cs.%-
me013|actually a p d f.|s^bc
me013|but you know uh but either way.|s
fe016|p d f.|s^bk^m
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah uh|s.%-
fe016|something like that where it's sort of data driven.|s^cs
me013|yeah but i think also i think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at examples of the data and can not see a change in how big the the signal is when the two speaker|s^bk|s^arp.%--
mn005|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me013|then that's a problem right there.|s
me013|so i think you should at least be able|s^cs.%--
fe016|oh yeah.|b
me013|doing casual looking and can get the sense hey there's something there.|s^cs:s
me013|and then you can play around with the measures.|s
fe016|oh yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and when he's looking in the log domain he's not really seeing it.|s^df
me013|so|%--
me013|and when he's looking in straight energy he is.|s^df^rt
me013|so that's a good place to start.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um so that was that was the discussion we just had.|fh|s^tc
me013|um the other thing|fh|s.%--
me013|actually we had a question for adam in this.|s
me013|uh when you did the sampling uh over the speech segments or or sampling over the the individual channels in order to do the uh the amplitude equalization did you do it over just the entire everything in the mike channels?|qy^rt
mn005|how|%-
me013|you didn't try to find speech?|qy^d
me011|no i just took over the entire uh entire channel.|s^ar|s
me011|um sampled ten minutes randomly.|fh|s
me013|right okay.|s^bk
me013|so then that means that someone who didn't speak very much would be largely represented by silence.|s^bu
me011|yep.|s^aa
me013|and someone who would who would be|s.%--
me013|so the normalization factor probably is is is|s.%-
me011|yeah this was quite quick and dirty and it was just for listening.|fg|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|and for listening it seems to work really well.|s^df
mn005|yeah.|s^bk^rt
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
me013|but that's|s.%--
me013|right.|fh
me011|but it's not not a good measure.|s^df
me013|so|%-
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so yeah there there there there's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts that there is there there is still a lot more to be gained from gain normalization with some sort|s^bs.%--
mn005|yeah yeah.|s^bk
mn005|huh.|b
me011|yes absolutely.|s^bk
me013|if if we can figure out a way to do it.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|uh but we were agreed that in addition to that uh there should be stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth.|fh|s^bs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so we didn't talk at all about uh the other derivatives.|s^tc
me013|but uh again just just looking at|s.%-
me013|uh i think uh liz has a very good point that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|well actually you do have some distributions here uh for these cases.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|you have some histograms.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um and uh they don't look very separate.|fh|s
me013|uh separated.|fh|s^bsc
mn005|this is the the first derivate of log of frame energy uh without any kind of normalization.|s
fe016|what|qw.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|log energy.|s^m
mn005|these these are the the first experiments uh with comment uh|s.%--
fe016|sorry.|s^fa
fe016|frame energy.|s
me011|except that it's hard to judge this because the they're not normalized.|s
me011|it's just number of frames.|s^e
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|but yeah even so.|s^bd
fe016|i mean what i meant is even if you use linear you know raw measures like raw energy or whatever.|s
me013|number|s.%-
fe016|maybe we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution's shape.|s^cs
fe016|and just use you know use the distribution to model the the mean.|s^cs
fe016|or what you know rather than the mean take some|s^cs.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me013|but and so in in these he's got that.|s^df
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|he's got some pictures.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but he doesn't he doesn't in the i|s.%--
me013|just in derivatives but not in the|s.%-
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|oh.|s^bk
me013|but he but he doesn't doesn't|s.%--
fe016|right so we don't know what they look like on the tsk for the raw.|fg|s
me013|but he didn't have it for the energy.|s
me013|he had it for the derivatives.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|i mean there might be something there.|s^cs
fe016|i don't know.|s^no
fe016|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|interesting.|s^ba^t1
mn005|here i i|s.%-
me013|oh that yeah that's a good|s^ba.%--
mn005|in no i i i haven't the result.|s^ar
me013|did did you have this sort of thing for just the just the uh the the unnormalized log energy?|qy
me013|okay yeah.|s^bk
me013|so she she's right.|s
mn005|but it's the it's the the the following.|s
me013|that's a|s.%-
fe016|well it might be just good to know what it looks like.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|because|s.%-
me013|that's that's uh because i'd mentioned scatter plots before but she's right.|s
mn005|huh?|qw^br
me013|i mean even before you get the scatter plots just looking at a single feature uh looking at the distribution is a good thing to do.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|uh combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters.|s
mn005|i i i i mean the the the scatter plot combining uh different two combination.|s
me013|yeah but but what she's saying is which is right is|fg|s.%--
mn005|combination of two of energy and derivate|s.%--
me013|i mean let's start with the|s.%--
me013|before we get complicated let's start with the most basic thing which is we're arguing that if you take energy uh if you look at the energy that when two people are speaking at the same time usually there'll be more energy than when one is.|s
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|that's that sort of hypothesis.|s^e
mn005|that's right.|s^aa
me013|and the first way you'd look at that uh she's you know absolutely right.|s
me013|is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|much as you've plotted them here.|s
me013|you know but just but just just uh do it|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|well in this case you have three.|s
me013|you have the silence and that that's fine.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so uh with three colors or three shades or whatever.|s
me013|just just look at those distributions.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|and then given that as a base you can see if that gets improved you know or or or worsened by the looking at regular energy looking at log energy.|s
me013|we were just proposing that maybe it's you know it's harder to see with the log energy.|s^cs^rt
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um and uh also these different normalizations does a particular choice of normalization make it better?|fh|qh^rt
me013|but i had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on that you look at scatter plots.|s
me013|because that's looking at a distribution in two dimensions.|s^df
me013|let's start off just in one uh with this feature.|s^co
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|i think that's probably the most basic thing before anything very complicated.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|um and then i think we're agreed that pitch related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate to help.|fh|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|i agree yeah.|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|um but since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data is that when you looked at the regular energy that it did in fact usually go up when two people were talking that's uh you know you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition.|s
mn005|okay.|b
mn005|yeah.|b.x
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|b
me013|and she's right that a that having a having having this table with a whole bunch of things with the standard deviation the variance and so forth it's it's it's harder to interpret than just looking at the the same kind of picture you have here.|s^df
mn005|but|%-
mn005|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|but it it's curious but uh i i found it in the in the mixed file in one channel that uh in several oh uh several times uh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn005|uh in the middle uh a zone of overlapping with huh less energy.|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and uh come with another speaker with high energy.|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and the overlapping zone has uh less energy.|s
me013|yeah so there'll be some cases for which|fg|s.%-
mn005|because there reach very many|s.%-
fe016|right.|b
me013|but the so so they'll be|s.%--
me013|this is i want to point to visual things.|s
me013|but i mean they there'll be time there'll be overlap between the distributions.|s
me013|but the question is if it's a reasonable feature at all there's some separation.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|especially locally.|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so locally|s.%--
mn005|just locally yeah.|s^aa^m
me011|and i was just going to say that that right now we're just exploring.|s
fe016|and the other thing is|s.%--
fe016|sorry.|s^fa
fe016|i|%-
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|what you would imagine eventually is that you'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|and so even if if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah this is the|s.%-
me013|right i mean the the reason i had suggested the scatter features is i used to do this a lot when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at.|fg|s
me013|um because something is a good feature uh by itself you don't really know how it'll behave in combination.|s^df
me013|and so it's nice to have as many as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form.|s^cs
me013|there's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny funny way.|s
me013|but it's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones at least have have some uh some hope.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|well especially for normalizing.|s
fe016|i mean it's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature.|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same.|s
fe016|actually i was wondering right now you're taking a all of the speech from the whole meeting and you're trying to find points of overlap.|s
fe016|but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker.|s
fe016|right?|qy^d^g
me013|right.|s^aa^m
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|so i mean another way would just be to take the speech from just say morgan and just jane and then just their overlaps.|s^cs
fe016|like but by hand.|s
fe016|by cheating.|s
fe016|and looking at you know if you can detect something that way.|s^cs
fe016|because if we can't do it that way there's no good way that we're going to be able to do it.|s^df
me011|no prayer.|s^e
fe016|that you know there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|plus i think it has more elegant|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|the the right model will be easier to see that way.|s
fe016|so if i don't know if you go through and you find adam because he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has enough speech|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and just sort of look at those three cases of adam and the other person and the overlaps.|s^cs
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|maybe|%--
fe016|and just look at the distributions maybe there is a clear pattern.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
fe016|but we just can't see it because there's too many combinations of of people that can overlap.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|i had the same intuition last last last week.|s
fe016|so|fh
mn005|yeah?|qy^bh^rt
fe016|just seems sort of complex.|s
fe008|i think it's to start with it's your your idea of simplifying.|s
fe008|starting with something that you can see uh you know without the extra layers of|s.%-
fe016|right.|fg
fe016|because if energy doesn't matter there like|s.%--
fe016|i don't think this is true but what if|s.%--
mn005|to study individual.|s
fe016|huh?|qw^br
fe008|sorry.|s^fa
fe008|what?|qw^br
mn005|to study individual.|s
fe008|well you you you don't have to study everybody individually.|s^cs
fe016|well to study the simplest case to get rid of extra|s.%--
mn005|the the the but consider|s.%-
fe008|but just simple case.|s^e
fe008|and the one that has the lot of data associated with it.|s^e
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|because what if it's the case and i don't think this is true|s.%--
me011|that was a great overlap by the way.|s^ba
fe016|what if it's the case that when two people overlap they equate their you know there's a conservation of energy and everybody|qh.%--
fe016|both people talk more softly?|qh
fe016|i don't think this happens at all.|s^bd
fe008|or or what if what if the equipment what if the equipment adjusts somehow?|qrr^e
fe016|or they get louder.|s
fe008|there's some equalizing in there.|s
fe016|yeah or|s^aap.%--
me013|uh no we don't have that.|h|s^ar
fe016|i mean|s^rt.%-
me013|but|%-
me011|well but but i think that's what i was saying about different types of overlap.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|saturation.|s^t1
fe016|there are there are different types.|s
fe016|and within those types|s.%--
fe016|like as jose was saying that sounded like a backchannel overlap.|s
fe016|meaning the kind that's a friendly encouragement like uhhuh.|s:s
fe016|great.|s:s^ba
fe016|yeah.|s:s^ba
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and it doesn't take you don't take the floor.|s
fe016|um but some of those as you showed i think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fh
fe016|it actually the new student don who um adam has met and he was at one of our meetings|s.%--
fe016|he's getting his feet wet and then he'll be starting again in mid january.|s
fe016|he's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap.|s
fe016|i don't know if he's talked with you yet.|s^no
mn005|yeah.|fg
fe016|but in sort of honing in on these different types.|s
mn005|i don't now i don't consider that possibility.|s
fe016|and so maybe|s.%--
mn005|this is a a general studio of the overlapping we're studying the|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then you know look at that.|s^cs
me013|well i i i i would actually still recommend that he do the overall thing.|s
me013|because it would be the quickest thing for him to do.|s^df
me013|he could you see he already has all his stuff in place.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|he has the histogram mechanism.|s
me013|he has the stuff that subtracts out|s.%--
me013|and all he has to do is change it uh uh from from log to plain energy and plot the histogram and look at it.|s
me013|and then he should go on and do the other stuff|s^cs.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|but but this will|s.%-
fe016|yeah no i didn't mean that that for you to do that.|fg|s^ar
fe016|but i was thinking if if don and i are trying to get categories.|s^cs
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and we label some data for you and we say this is what we think is going|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so you don't have to worry about it.|s
fe016|and here's the three types of overlaps.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and we'll we'll do the labelling for you.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|huh huh.|b
fe016|um|%-
mn005|consider different class of overlap?|qy^d^rt
fe016|yeah that we would be working on anyway.|s^na
mn005|if there's time.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|then maybe you can try some different things for those three cases and see if that helps or|s^cs.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|this is the thing i i comment with you before that uh we have a great variation of situation of overlapping.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and the behavior for energy is uh log energy is not uh the same all the time.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and|%-
me013|but i guess i was just saying that that right now uh from the means that you gave i don't have any sense of whether even you know there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct|s.%--
me013|and i would imagine there should be some you know there should be the distributions should be somewhat separated.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|uh and i i would still guess that if they are not separated at all that there's some there's there's most likely something wrong in the way that we're measuring it.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um but um for instance i mean i wouldn't expect that it was very common overall that when two people were talking at the same time that it would that it really was lower.|fh|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|although sometimes as you say it would.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah no that was that was a|fg|s^df.%--
me013|so so|fh
fe016|or a sort of a case where where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals.|s^df
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|i mean|s.%--
me013|no.|s^bd^rt
me013|it could it probably does happen sometimes.|s^bd
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|mind if i turned that light off?|qy
fe016|so|fg
me011|the flickering is annoying me.|s^df
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe016|it might the case though that the significant energy just as jose was saying comes in the non backchannel cases.|s
fe016|because in most people when they're talking don't change their own energy when they get a backchannel.|s^df
fe016|because they're not really predicting the backchannel.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and sometimes it's a nod and sometimes it's an uhhuh.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and the uhhuh is really usually very low energy.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|so maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy.|s^cs
fe016|but all the other cases might.|s^cs
fe016|and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot in terms of their words or|s.%--
me013|and and again what they what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log.|s
fe016|i mean just listen to it.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fh
me013|so|fh
fe016|well it would be lost no matter what you do.|s^aap
mn005|but|%-
me013|as well.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|it just|s.%--
me013|huh no.|s^ar^rt
me013|if it's if if it's|s^df.%-
me011|tone|%-
me013|well it won't be as big.|s
fe016|i mean even if you take the log you can your model just has a more sensitive measures.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|sure but tone might be very|s^bk|s.%--
fe016|so|fh
me011|yeah you're uhhuh tone is going to be very different.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|right right.|s^bk
me011|you could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of back channels if you could if you had a good model for it.|s
me011|your uhhuh detector.|s
me013|if if you're i guess my point is if you're doing essentially a linear separation taking the log first does in fact make it harder to separate.|s^tc
me011|right.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so it's so uh if you so if there if there close to things it does|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|it's a nonlinear operation that does in fact change the distinction.|s
me013|if you're doing a if you're doing some fancy thing then then|s.%--
me013|yeah.|s
me013|and right now we're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and and saying we're going to cut it here.|s
me013|um and that that's the indicator that we're getting.|s
me013|but anyway yeah we're not disagreeing on any of this.|s
me013|we should look at it more uh more finely but uh uh i think that this often happens you do fairly complicated things and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple.|s
me013|so uh if you generated something like that just for the energy and see and then as as liz says when they have uh uh smaller um more coherent groups to look at that would be another interesting thing later.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|and then that should give us some indication between those should give us some indication of whether there's anything to be achieved from energy at all.|s^rt
me013|and then you can move on to the uh uh more pitch related stuff.|s^cs
mn005|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i i i think this is a good idea.|s^ba
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn005|not consider the log energy.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|but then the|s.%--
me013|have you started looking at the pitch related stuff at all?|qy
me013|or|qr.%--
mn005|the|qw^br.%--
me013|pitch related.|s^r^rt
me013|harmonicity and so on.|s^rt
mn005|i i'm preparing the the program but i don't i don't begin because uh i saw your email.|s
me013|preparing to|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and i agree with you it's better to i suppose it's better to to consider the the energy this kind of parameter|s.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me013|oh that's not what i meant.|s^ar
me013|no no.|s^ar
me013|i i i i|s.%--
me013|well we certainly should see this but i i i i think that the|s.%--
me013|i certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things.|s
me013|i was just saying|s.%-
mn005|i i go on with the with the pitch.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn005|aha okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah i was just saying|s.%-
mn005|i i i i understood uh that uh i i had to finish by the moment with the and and concentrate my my energy in that problem.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay okay.|fg
me013|but i think like all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things|s.%--
me013|i think i would just sort of look at the energy and then get into the harmonicity as as a suggestion.|s^cs
mn005|okay.|s^bk
mn005|i go on with the pitch.|s
me013|uh okay.|s^tc
me013|so maybe uh since we're trying to uh compress the meeting.|s^t
me013|um i know adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about.|s^rt
me013|and did you have some|qo^rt.%--
fe008|i wanted to ask just something on the end of this topic.|s
fe008|so when i presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers at the bottom of that i did have a proposal.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and i had plan to go through with it of of coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in just with reference to speaker style so you know with reference.|s
fe016|oh.|s^bk
fe016|that'd be great.|s^ba
fe008|and you know i said that on my in my summary.|s
fe016|yeah i|s.%--
fe008|that you know so it's like people may have different amounts of being overlapped with or overlapping.|s^rt
fe016|right.|b
fe008|but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they're involved in.|s
fe008|so i was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that.|s
fe016|that would be great.|s^ba
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|that would be really great.|s^ba^r
fe008|so but it you know it's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction.|s
me011|huh.|b
fe008|is is it|qy.%-
fe016|we have nothing|s.%--
fe016|you know basically we got his environment set up.|s
fe016|he's he's a double e you know.|s^df
fe016|so it's mostly that if we had to label it ourselves we we would or we'd have to to get started.|s^df^rt
fe016|but if it it would be much better if you can do it.|s^cs
fe016|you'd be much better at doing it also.|s
fe016|because you know i i'm not i don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out.|s
fe008|interesting.|s^ba^t1
fe016|and i really didn't want to go into that if i didn't have to.|s
fe016|so if if you're willing to do that or or|s.%-
fe008|well maybe we can|s^cs.%-
me011|it would be interesting though to talk maybe not at the meeting but at some other time about what are the classes.|s
fe008|okay.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|s^bk
fe016|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|i think that's a research effort in and of itself.|s
me011|yeah it would be interesting.|s^ba
fe016|because you can read the literature but i don't know how it'll turn out.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and you know it's always an interesting question.|s
mn005|i would think it's interesting yeah.|s^ba
fe008|it seems like we also with reference to a purpose too that we we'd want to have them coded.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|that'd be great.|s^ba
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
fe016|that'd be really great.|s^ba
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe016|and we'd still have some funding for this project.|s
fe008|i can do that.|s
mn005|uh uh|%-
fe016|like probably if we had to hire some like an undergrad because uh don is being covered half time on something else.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|i mean he we're not paying him the full r a ship for all the time.|s
fe016|so um if we got it to where we wanted we needed someone to do that|s.%--
fe016|i don't think there's really enough data where where|s.%--
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|yeah i see this as a prototype to use the only the the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
mn005|i i think another parameter we we we can consider is uh the duration.|s
fe016|but|%-
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn005|another besides uh the the class of overlap the duration.|s
mn005|because is possible uh some um uh some classes uh has uh a type of a duration.|s
mn005|uh a duration very short uh when we have we have overlapping with speech.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|yeah definitely.|s^bk^t1
fe008|yeah maybe it may be correlated.|s
mn005|is possible to have|s.%--
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and it's interesting i think to consider the the window of normalization.|s
mn005|normalization window.|s
mn005|uh because uh if we have a type of a kind of uh overlap uh back channel overlap with a short duration is possible uh to|s^df.%--
mn005|that if we normalize uh with uh uh consider only the the uh window uh by the left uh uh side on the right side overlapping with a a very uh oh a small window|s.%--
mn005|uh the if the fit of normalization is uh huh bigger uh in that overlapping zone uh very short.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|yeah that's true.|s^aa
fe016|the window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel.|s^bs
mn005|i i i i understand.|s
mn005|i mean that you have uh you have a backchannel uh uh you have a overlapping zone very short.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn005|and you consider uh uh all the channel to normalize this very short uh|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|for example huh uhhuh huh uh.|s:s
mn005|and the energy is not uh height.|s
mn005|uh i think if you consider all the channel to normalize and the channel is huh bigger uh uh uh compared with the with the overlapping uh duration.|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uh the effect is huh stronger.|s
mn005|uh that i i mean the the effect of the normalization uh with the mean and the and the variance uh is different that if you consider only a window compared uh with the the duration of overlapping.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|not|%-
me013|you you want it around the overlapping part.|s^bu
me013|you want it to include something that's not in overlapping.|s^e
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me013|but but uh|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i i don't know.|s^no
mn005|is if|%-
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|well it's a sliding window.|s
fe016|right?|qy^d^g
fe016|so if you take the the measure in the center of the overlapped piece you know there'd better be something.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|but if your window is really huge then yeah you're right.|s
fe016|you won't even|s.%--
mn005|yeah this is the this is the the idea to consider only the the small window near near near the the overlapping zone.|s
fe016|the portion of the of the backchannel won't won't effect anything.|s
fe016|but you|s.%-
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fg
fe016|you know you shouldn't be more than|s.%--
fe016|like you should definitely not be three times as big as your as your backchannel.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|then you're going to have a wash.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and hopefully it's more like on the order of|s.%--
me013|i'm not sure that's necessarily true.|s^no
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|it is an empirical question it seems like.|s
me013|because because it because um again if you're just compensating for the gain|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|you know the fact that this this gain thing was crude.|s
me013|and the gain if someone is speaking relatively at consistent level just to to give a an extreme example all you're doing is compensating for that.|s^df
me013|and then you still and then if you look at the frame with respect to that it still should should uh change.|s
fe016|yeah it depends how different your normalization is as you slide your window across.|fg|s
fe016|i mean that's something we don't know.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|it's possible to try it both ways.|s^cs
me011|well i mean we're also talking about a couple of different things.|s
fe008|isn't it?|qy^g
fe008|in this small|s^t1.%--
me011|i mean one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you're doing.|s
fe016|yeah i was talking about the normalization window.|fg|s
me011|and the and they could be quite different.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me013|right.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|this was sort of where where we were last week.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|that's true yeah.|s^aa
me011|yep.|s^aa
me013|but anyway we we'll have to look at some core things.|s^co^t
fe016|um|fg
mn005|okay.|s^bk
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe016|but that'd be great if if you're marking those|s^ba.%--
fe016|and um|fh
fe008|great.|s^bk
fe008|okay.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|but it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and i was assuming that will be inherited because if you have the words and they're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using then you know this student and i would be looking at the time marks.|s
fe008|yep i agree.|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels jane gave.|s
fe008|coming off of the other|s^2.%-
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|good.|b
fe008|so it wouldn't be i wasn't planning to label the time marks.|s
mn005|i can give you my transcription file.|s^cs
fe008|i was thinking that that would come from the engineering side.|s^df
fe016|i don't think you need to.|s^no
mn005|no?|qy^d^g
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|yeah that should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow.|fg|s
fe008|there you go.|s^aa
fe016|right?|qy^d^g
me011|well we're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment.|s
fe016|not now.|s^aap
me011|so|fh
mn005|yeah.|b.%
me011|um if it's not hand marked then we're not going to get the times.|s
fe016|well it's something that|s.%--
fe016|well we we wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway.|s^rt
mn005|yes|%-
fe016|so somehow if once he gets going we're going to have to come up with one.|s^cs
fe016|and|%--
me013|yes.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
fe008|good good.|s^ba
me011|i mean i guess we could do a very bad one with broadcast news.|s
fe016|so whatever you would label would be attached to the words i think.|s
fe008|great!|b
fe008|good good.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|well again for the close mike stuff we could come up take a take the switchboard system or something.|s
me011|that might be good enough.|s^ba
me011|yeah.|b
me013|and um|fh
me011|it'd be worth a try.|s
me011|it would be interesting to see what we get.|s
me013|just you know low pass filter the speech and|s^cs.%--
fe016|because there's there's a lot of work you can't do without that.|s
fe016|i mean how how would you|qh.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|you'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word.|s
fe016|is if you're interested in anything to do with words.|s
fe008|it would be very inefficient.|s^ba
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fh
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|anyway so that'd be great.|s^tc|s^ba
fe008|good okay.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|there's something we should talk about later.|s^t^tc
me013|but maybe not just now.|s
me013|but uh should talk about our options as far as the uh uh transcription.|s^co
me013|but well but we'll do that later.|s
me011|yep if i b m doesn't.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|good.|b
fe016|do we have to turn|qy.%--
fe016|are we supposed to keep recording here?|qy^rt
fe008|yeah let's do that later.|s^bk|s^cs
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|yeah right.|s^ba
me013|we'll talk about it later.|s^cs^m
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|so uh uh|fg
me013|forms.|s^t^tc
me013|you had something on forms.|s^rt
me011|forms next iteration of forms.|s^rt
me011|oops.|s^t1
fe008|oh!|s^fe
fe008|oh good okay.|s^ba
me013|um|fh
me013|oh.|b
fe008|how so it's two pages per person?|qy^rt
me011|nope.|s^ar
me011|one's a digit form.|s
me011|one's a speaker form.|s
fe008|oh!|s^bk^fe^rt
me011|so one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits.|s
fe008|oh i see.|s^bk
mn005|oh it's the same.|s^rt
mn005|oh no no.|s^t1
mn005|is is new is okay.|s^t1
me011|so don't fill these out.|s^co
fe008|all right.|s^bk
me011|this is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like.|s^df
me011|so they incorporate the changes that we talked about.|s
fe008|date and time.|s^t1
fe008|uh why did you switch the order of the date and time fields?|qw^rt
fe008|this is rather a low level but|s^bd.%-
me011|on which one?|qw^d
fe008|on on the new one time comes first and then date.|s
fe008|but i thought|s.%--
me011|oh you mean on the digit form?|qy^rt
fe008|this is this is rather a low level question but but it used used to be date came first.|s
me011|uh because the user fills out the first three fields and i fill out the rest.|s
fe008|oh i see.|s^bk
me011|so it was intentional.|s^rt
fe008|well how would the how would the user know the time if they didn't know the date?|qw
me011|it's an interesting observation.|s^ba^rt
me011|but it was intentional.|s^df
me011|because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and|s.%--
me011|excuse me.|s^fa
me011|the time is when you actually read the digits but i'm filling out the date beforehand.|s^bsc
me011|if you look at the form in front of you that you're going to fill out when you read the digits you'll see i've already filled in the date but not the time.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|i always assumed|s.%-
fe008|so the time is supposed to be pretty exact.|s^bu
fe008|because i've just been taking beginning time time of the meeting.|s
fe016|yeah me too.|s^na
mn005|yeah i|%-
me011|yeah i've noticed that in the forms.|fg|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|the the reason i put the time in is so that the person who's extracting the digits meaning me will know where to look in the meeting to try to find the digits.|s
mn005|me too.|s^aa^m
mn005|oh.|s^bk
fe008|oh dear!|s^bk^fe
mn005|but i am put i am putting the beginning of the meeting.|s
fe008|we've been we've been messing up your forms.|s^rt
me011|i know.|s^aa
fe016|so you should call it like digits start time or|qr.%--
me011|and i haven't said anything.|s
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn005|in on there.|s
me013|why what what were you putting in?|qw^rt
fe008|oh well i was saying if we started the meeting at two thirty.|s^rt
mn005|yeah.|b^rt
fe008|i'd put two thirty and i guess everyone was putting two thirty.|s
me013|oh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|and i didn't realize there was uh oh i'm about to read this and i should|s.%--:s.%--
me011|no it's about fifty fifty.|s^ar|s
me011|actually it's about one third each.|s^bsc
me011|about one third of them are blank.|s
me011|about one third of them are when the digits are read.|s
me011|and about one third of them are when the meeting starts.|s
mn005|oh.|s^bk
me011|so|fh
fe008|this would be a radical suggestion but|s^cs.%-
me011|i could put instructions?|qy^d^rt
fe008|either that or maybe you could maybe write down when people start reading digits on that particular session.|s^aap^cs
me011|nah.|s^ar
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me011|but if i'm not at the meeting i can't do that.|s^ng
fe008|i know okay.|s^aa^bd
me013|yeah he's been setting stuff up and going away so|fg|s.%--
fe008|that's a good point.|s^ba
fe008|i see.|s^bk
fe008|good point good point.|s^bk
me013|for some reason he doesn't want to sit through every meeting that's|s^df^j.%-
me011|yep but that is the reason name email and time are where they are.|fg|s^rt
fe008|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|all right.|s^bk
fe008|i rest my|s.%--
me011|and then the others are later on.|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|okay.|s^bk
mn005|and the seat is this number?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
fe008|seat and session.|s^rt^t1
fe016|for official use only.|s
fe016|that's well he's very professional.|s^df^rt
mn005|use only|s^rt.%--
fe008|actually you could|s.%--
fe008|well that does raise another question which is why is the professional use only line not higher?|qw
fe008|why doesn't it come in at the point of date and seat?|qw
fe008|oh because we're filling in other things.|s^bk|s
me011|what?|qw^br
me013|what?|qw^br
fe008|well because if your your professional use|s.%--
fe008|you're going to already have the date and the|s.%--
me011|what which form are you talking about?|qw
fe008|well i'm comparing the new one with the old one.|s
fe008|this is the digit form.|s
mn005|oh.|s^bk
me011|oh you're talking about the digit form.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|digit digit form.|s
fe008|oh i wasn't supposed to|s^rt.%-
me011|the digit form doesn't the digit|s.%-
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|sorry sorry.|s^fa
me011|no that's all right.|s^bd^rt
me011|the digit form doesn't have a for official use only line.|s^df
me011|it just has a line which is what you're supposed to read.|s^e
fe008|that|%--
fe008|uh okay.|s^bk
fe008|sorry about that.|s^fa
me011|so on the digits form everything above the line is a fill in form.|s^rt
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|and everything below the line is digits that the user reads.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|all right but i didn't mean to derail our discussion here.|s^bk|s
fe008|so you really wanted to start with this other form.|s^bu
me011|no either way is fine.|s^ar|s
me011|i just you just started talking about something and i didn't know which form you were referring to.|s
fe008|all right yeah i was comparing|fg|s.%--
fe008|so this is so i was looking at the change first.|s
fe008|so it's like we started with this and now we've got a new version of it with reference to this.|s
fe008|so the digit form.|s
fe008|we had one already.|s
fe008|now the the fields are slightly different.|s
me013|so the main thing that the person fills out um is the name and email and time?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn005|yeah.|b.%
me011|right.|s^aa
mn005|uh|b
me013|you do the rest?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|just as uh as i have for all the others.|s^e
me013|right.|s^bk
fe008|what and there's an addition of the native language which is a bit redundant.|s
fe008|this one has native language and this one does too.|s^rt
me011|that's because the one the digit form that has native language is the old form.|s^df
fe008|oh thank you thank you thank you.|s^bk^ft
me011|not the new form.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|there we go.|s^t1
fe008|oh yeah.|s^bk
fe008|i'll catch up here.|s^fa^t1
fe008|okay i see.|s^bk^t1
me013|south midland north midland|s.%-
fe008|that's the old and that's the new.|s^t1
me011|yeah this was the problem with these categories.|fg|s^rt
me011|i i picked those categories from timit.|s^df^rt
me011|i don't know what those are.|s^no
fe016|actually the only way i know is from working with the data base and having to figure it out.|s
mn005|what|qw.%-
me011|with timit.|s^2^bu^rt
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|yeah?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|so is south midland like kansas?|qy^rt
mn005|what|%-
me011|so i was going to ask|s.%-
me011|i mean|%-
me013|and north midland like like uh illinois or|qr.%--
fe016|well yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|um|s.%-
me011|so so what accent are we speaking?|qw
me011|western?|qy^bu^g^rt
me013|by definition?|qy^d^rt
mn005|and for simple for for me?|qw^d
mn005|is mean my native language spanish spanish?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|well|%-
fe016|probably western yeah.|s^am
mn005|uh the original is the center of spain and the|s.%--
me011|yeah i mean you could call it whatever you want.|s^bk|s
me011|for the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one.|s^df
me011|so i just left it blank and you can put whatever you want.|s
mn005|because is different the uh the spanish language from the the north of spain of the south of the west and the|s.%--
me011|sure.|s^bk
mn005|but|%--
me011|so i'm not sure what to do about the region field for english variety.|s^no
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|you know when i wrote i was writing those down i was thinking you know these are great if you're a linguist.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|actually even if you|s.%--
me011|but i don't know how to i don't know how to i don't know how to categorize them.|s^no
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|if you're if if|s.%-
fe016|this wasn't developed by these regions weren't|s.%--
me013|if you're a t i or m i t from nineteen eighty five|s.%--
me011|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so i guess my only question was if if you were a south midland speaking region person would you know it?|qy^rt
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me011|is that what you would call yourself?|qy^rt
fe016|i don't know.|s^no^rt
me011|yeah.|s^bk
me013|you know i think if you're talking if you're thinking in terms of places as opposed to names different names people have given to different ways of talking i would think north midwest and south midwest would be more common than saying midland.|fg|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|i mean i i went to|s.%-
fe016|yeah now the usage|s^aa|s.%--
fe016|maybe we can give them a like a little map.|s^cs^rt
fe016|with the regions and they just|s.%--
fe016|no i'm serious.|s^df
fe008|no that's not bad.|s^ba
fe016|because it takes less time and it's sort of cute.|s^df^rt
mn005|at this in that side in that side of the the paper.|s^bu^ng
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|there's no figure.|s^rt
me013|well|%-
fe016|well just a little|s^df.%--
fe016|you know it doesn't have all the detail.|s
fe016|but you sort of|s.%--
me013|but what if you moved five times and and uh|qw^ng.%--
fe008|well i was thinking you could have multiple ones and then the amount of time|s^cs.%--
fe016|no but you're categorized.|s^ar|s
fe016|that's the same|s.%-
fe008|so roughly|s.%--
fe008|so you could say you know ten years on the east coast five years on the west coast or something or other.|s^e
me011|well we i think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form.|s^nd
me011|i think that's all right if we want to follow up.|s^rt
me011|but|%--
me013|i guess we don't really know.|s^no
fe016|i mean i as i said i don't think there's a huge benefit to this region thing.|s^na
fe016|it it gets|s.%--
fe016|the problem is that for some things it's really clear and usually listening to it you can tell right away if it's a new york or boston accent.|s
fe016|but new york and boston are two|s.%--
fe016|well i guess they have the n y c.|s
fe016|but new england has a bunch of very different dialects.|s
fe016|and|%--
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and so does um so do other places.|s
me011|yeah so i picked these regions because we had talked about timit.|s^df
fe016|right.|s^bk
me011|and those are right from timit.|s^e
fe016|and so these would be satisfying like a speech research community if we released the database.|s
me011|so|fh
fe016|but as to whether subjects know where they're from i'm not sure because um i know that they had to fill this out for switchboard.|s
fe016|this is almost exactly the same as switchboard regions.|s
fe008|oh okay.|s^bk
fe016|or very close.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|um and i don't know how they filled that out.|fh|s
fe016|but if midland|s.%--
fe016|yeah midland is the one that's difficult i guess.|s
fe008|i think a lot of people|s.%-
fe016|also northwest you've got washington and oregon now which uh people don't know if it's western or northern.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|yeah i certainly don't.|s^na
me011|i mean i was saying i don't even know what i speak.|s^no
fe016|it's like northwest|s.%--
me013|oh what is northern?|qw
me011|am i speaking am i speaking western?|qy^rt
me013|well and what and what's northern?|qw^r
fe016|i think originally it was north northwest.|s
me011|northwest.|s^2
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|but|%--
me011|yeah so this is a real problem.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|i don't know what to do about it.|s^no
fe008|i wouldn't know how to characterize mine either.|s^no
fe008|and and so i would think i would say i've i've got a mix of california and ohio.|s
me011|i|%-
me011|i think at the first level for example we speak the same.|s
fe016|i don't know.|s^no
me011|our our dialects or whatever you region are the same.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b^rt
me011|but i don't know what it is.|s^no
me011|so|fh
fe016|well you have a like techno speak accent i think.|s
me011|a techno speak accent?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
fe016|yeah you know|s^aa|s.%--
mn005|a|%--
me011|a a geek region?|qy^bu^d^j^rt
fe016|well it's i mean i you can sort of identify|s.%-
fe008|geek region.|s^m
fe016|it it's it's not not that that's|s^rt.%-
mn005|is different is different.|s
fe016|but but maybe that maybe we could leave this.|s^cs
fe016|and see what people see what people choose.|s^cs
fe016|and then um let them just fill in if they don't|s.%--
fe016|i mean i don't know what else we can do because that's north midland.|s
fe008|i'm wondering about a question like where are you from mostly.|s^cs:qw
mn005|yeah.|b.x
me013|but i i'm i'm now that you mentioned it though i am really am confused by northern.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|i agree i agree.|s^aa^rt
me013|i really am.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|i mean if if you're in new england that's north.|s^e
fe008|i agree.|s^t1
me013|if you're if you're|s.%--
fe008|scandinavian the minnesota area's north.|s^2
me013|uh yeah that's|h|s^na.%--
me013|but that's also north midland.|s^arp
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|oh.|s^bk
me013|and and and oregon and and oregon and washington are are western but they're also northern.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe016|of course that's very different from like michigan or|s.%--
mn005|huh.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh idaho?|qo^rt
fe016|well there are hardly any subjects from idaho.|s
me013|montana?|qo^rt
me011|no problem.|s
fe008|just rule them out.|s^co^j
fe016|there's only a few people in idaho.|s^r
me011|there are hardly any subjects from beep!|s^fe^j^m^t3
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|sorry.|s^fa^t3
fe016|no that's|s.%--
me013|maybe maybe we maybe we should put a little map and say put an x on where you're from.|s^cs:s^co
mn005|and is in those|s.%-
me011|yeah really.|s^aa
mn005|and if you put|%-
fe016|we could ask where they're from.|s^aa^m
fe008|it'd be pretty simple yeah.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|we went back to that.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|if you put uh the state|s^cs^rt.%-
me011|well well we sort of|s.%-
fe008|where are you from mostly.|s^cs:qw
fe016|we we went we went around this and then a lot of people ended up saying that it|s.%--
mn005|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
fe016|you know.|s^f
me011|well i like the idea of asking what variety of english do you speak as opposed to where you're from.|s
me011|because if we start asking where we're from again you have to start saying well is that the language you speak or is that just where you're from.|s^df:qr
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|huh.|b
fe016|right right.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|let's|%-
fe016|i mean it gives us good information on where they're from but that doesn't tell us anything|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|and|%-
me013|we could always ask them if they're from|s^cs.%-
fe016|well enough about their|s.%-
me011|i mean so so i would say germany.|fg|s:s
fe016|like|%-
me011|you know am i speaking with german accent?|qh
fe008|oh.|s^bk
me011|i don't think so.|s^ar
fe016|right.|b
fe008|well see i'm thinking where are you from mostly.|s^df
me011|oh okay yeah.|s^bk
fe008|because you know then you have some some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it.|s^df
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|yeah i guess i could try to put squeeze in a little map.|s^cs
me011|i mean there's not a lot of of room.|s
me013|i'd say uh boston new york city the south and regular.|s^cs^j
fe008|well|%-
me011|i think of those northern is the only one that i don't even know what they're meaning.|s
fe016|oh i don't know.|s^no
mn005|and and um and usually here people here know what is their kind of huh english language.|s
fe008|yeah yeah.|b
me013|that's a joke.|s
me013|that's|%-
fe016|so let's make it up.|s^co
fe016|i mean who cares?|qh
fe016|right?|qy^bu^d^g^rt
fe016|we can make up our own.|s
fe016|so we can say northwest rest of west or something.|s^cs
fe016|you know.|s^f
fe016|west|s.%--
fe016|and i mean|s.%-
me011|i don't think the northwest people speak any differently than i do.|s
fe016|it doesn't even|s.%-
fe016|yeah exactly.|s^aa
fe016|that's not really a region.|s
me013|do you come from the louisiana purchase?|qy^j
fe008|i|%-
fe016|so we could take out north northern.|s^cs
me011|you sure that people here know what is the the kind of english language uh he|qy^d.%--
mn005|uh is easy for people to know?|qy^d^rt
me011|that that's exactly what we're arguing about.|s^bk
fe016|that's|s.%-
fe016|yeah it's in it's it's harder in america anywhere else basically.|fg|s
me011|we don't know.|s^no
mn005|because you have|s.%-
me011|i mean some of them are very obvious.|s
me011|if you if you talk to someone speaking with southern drawl you know.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah or boston.|s^aa|s^e
me011|or boston yeah.|s^aa^m
fe008|i can't do it but|s.%--
mn005|or boston?|qy^br^d
fe016|and those people if you ask them to self identify their accent they know.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah they do.|s^aa
fe016|they know very well.|s^e
fe008|yeah i agree i agree i agree.|s^aa
fe016|they know they don't speak the same as the|s.%-
me011|but is boston new england?|qy^rt
fe008|and they're proud of it.|s
fe016|day|%-
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah exactly.|s^aa
fe008|it's identity thing.|s^df
fe016|and they're glad to tell you.|s
mn005|style.|s
fe016|well depends who you ask i suppose.|s^df
me011|i guess that's the problem with these categories.|s
fe016|but that's why they have new york city but|s.%--
fe008|well we well why can't we just say characterize something like characterize your accent?|qh
me013|well boston's too.|s
fe016|or|fh
fe016|characterize your accent if you can.|s^2
fe008|and and so i would say i don't know.|s:s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|right which probably means you have a very|s^aa|s.%-
fe008|but someone from boston with a really strong coloration would know.|s
fe008|and so would an r less maine or something.|s^e
fe016|and that's actually good.|s^e^rt
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|i was i was thinking of something along that line.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|how|qw.%-
fe016|because if you don't know then you know ruling out the fact that you're totally inept or something|s^df.%--
fe008|good.|s^ba
fe008|huh.|b
fe016|if somebody doesn't know it probably means their accent isn't very strong compared to the sort of midwest standard.|s
me013|well i mean it wasn't that long ago that we had somebody here who was from texas who was absolutely sure that he didn't have any accent left.|s^ng
fe008|huh.|b
me013|and and had he had a pretty noticeable drawl.|s^e
me011|okay so i propose take out northern add don't know.|fg|s^cs
fe008|oh yeah i i would say more more sweepingly how would you characterize your accent.|s^bk|s^cs^ng:qw
mn005|yeah.|b.%
me011|so you want to change the instructions also not just say region?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|well i think this discussion has made me think that's something to consider.|s^na
me011|i don't know.|s^nd
me011|if i if i read this form i think they're going to ask it they're going to answer the same way if you say what's variety of english do you speak.|s^df:qw
me011|region.|s
me011|as if you say what variety of region region do you speak.|s:qw
me011|please characterize your accent.|s:s
me011|they're going to answer the same way.|s
fe008|i guess|s^am.%-
fe008|well i was not sure that|s^df.%--
mn005|huh.|b
fe008|i|%-
fe008|so i was suggesting not having the options.|s^df
fe008|just having them|s^e.%--
me011|oh i see.|s^bk
mn005|huh.|b
me011|well what we talked about with that is is so that they would understand the granularity.|s
fe008|yes but if as liz is suggesting people who have strong accents know that they do.|s^bk|s
me011|i mean that's what i had before and you told me to list the regions to list them.|s^df^ng
fe008|and are|%-
fe016|each each one has pros and cons.|s
fe008|well i know.|s^df
me013|right.|s^aa
me013|right.|fg
me011|so|fh
fe016|i mean we we|s.%-
me013|right.|fg
fe008|that's true.|s^aa
me013|yeah last week last week i was sort of arguing for having it wide open.|fg|s
me013|but then everybody said oh no.|s:s^fe
me013|but then it will be hard to interpret.|s:s
me013|because some people will say cincinnati and some will say ohio.|s^df:s
me011|i mean i had it wide open last week and and you said timit.|s
me013|and|fh
fe016|what if we put in both?|qh
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|and would people|qy.%-
me011|that's what the other is for.|s^ng
fe016|no i mean what if we put in both ways of asking them?|s^ar|qh
fe016|so one is region.|s^e:s
fe016|and the another one is if you had to characterize yourself your accent what would you say.|s^cs^e^rt:qo
me011|won't they answer the same thing?|qy^ng
fe016|well they might only answer only one of the questions.|s^df
fe016|but if|%--
fe008|yeah that's fine.|s^aa
fe016|you know.|s^f
fe008|they might say other for region because they don't know what category to use.|s^cs
fe016|actually|%-
fe008|but they might have something|s.%--
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|it just and we|s.%-
fe008|because it is easier to have it open ended.|s
fe016|we might learn from what they say as to which one's a better way to ask it.|s^cs
fe016|but i because i really don't know.|s^bd^no
me013|this is just a small thing.|s^bd
me013|but um it says variety and then it gives things that have american as one of the choices.|s
me013|but then it says region.|s
me013|but region actually just applies to uh u s.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|right.|s^aa
me011|i mean that's why i put the other in.|s
fe008|well we thought about it.|s
me013|uh okay.|s^bk
fe008|yeah okay.|s^bk
fe008|we just we sort of thought yes i mean|s.%--
fe008|at the last meeting my recollection was that we felt people would have uh less|s.%--
fe008|that that there are so many types and varieties of these other languages.|s
fe008|and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups.|s
fe008|and that it's a huge waste of of space.|s^e
me011|yep.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|so i mean i i mean the way i had it last time was region was blank.|s
fe008|that's what i thought.|s^df
me011|it just said region colon.|s^e
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|and and i think that that's the best way to do it.|s
me011|because because of the problems we're talking about.|s^df
me011|but what we said last week was no put in a list.|s^df
me011|so i put in a list.|s
fe016|maybe we can make the list a little smaller.|s^cs
me011|so should we go back to|qy.%-
me011|well certainly dropping northern i think is right because none of us know what that is.|s^aap
fe016|because i mean|s.%-
fe016|and keeping other.|s^2^cs^rt
fe016|and then maybe this north midland we call it north midwest.|s^cs
fe016|south midwest or just|qr.%-
me013|yes i i i think so yeah.|s^aa
fe016|south midwest.|s
fe016|does that make sense?|qy^rt
mn005|south midwest?|qy^br.%
fe016|that would help me|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|because|%--
me013|unless you're from midland kansas.|s^arp
fe016|midland|s.%--
me013|but|fh
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|i don't know where midland is.|s^no^rt
me013|there's a or midland midland|s.%--
me013|is it midland midland midland texas or midland kansas?|qr
me011|is midwest one word?|qy^rt
fe016|yeah one|s^aa^m.%--
me013|i forget.|s^no
me013|but there's a town.|s
fe016|oh.|s^bk
me013|in in there.|s
me013|i forget what it is.|s^no
fe008|i don't think that's what they mean.|s^nd
fe016|but|%-
fe016|yeah so kansas would be south midland.|fg|s^bu
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|and and wouldn't|qy.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|so i'm from kansas actually.|s
me013|and colorado right across the border would be north midland.|s
mn005|southern midland.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|and uh|%-
fe016|oh right.|fg
fe016|and then the the dropping north|s.%--
fe016|so it would be western.|s
fe016|it's just one big shebang where of course you have huge variation in dialects.|s
me013|but you do in the others too so|s^arp^df.%--
me011|but that's true of new england too.|s^df
fe016|but but so do you|s^df.%-
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|so i mean only one|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah yeah.|b
me011|well i shouldn't say that.|s^df
me011|i have no clue.|s^no
me011|i was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is new york city.|s
me011|but i have no idea whether it does or not.|s^df^no
fe008|it does seem|s.%--
fe008|i mean i i would think that these categories would be more would be easier for an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself.|s^cs
me011|i think that that was what happened with timit was that it was an analyst.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|wait a minute.|s^co^tc
me013|where does where does where where's where does uh new new york west of west of uh new york city and pennsylvania uh and uh|qw.%-
fe016|yeah i don't know how it came from.|s^bk|s^no
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe016|so that's new england i think.|s
me011|new england.|s
me013|no it's not!|s^ar^fe
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me011|oh no!|s^fe
me013|oh no.|s^ar
fe008|i sort of thought they were part of the one of the midlands.|s
me013|no no no.|s^ar
me013|pennsylvania is not|s.%--
me011|other.|s
me011|it goes under other.|s
me011|definitely under other.|s
fe016|well you know pennsylvania has a pretty strong dialect and it's totally different than|s.%--
me013|pennsylvania|s.%--
me013|yeah pennsylvania is not new england.|fg|s
me013|and uh new jersey is not new england and maryland is not new england and none of those are the south.|s^rt
me011|okay so|fg
me011|another suggestion.|s^tc
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|rather than have circle fill in forms say region open paren e g southern comma western comma close paren colon.|s
fe008|okay.|s^aa
fe016|okay.|s^aa
me013|that's good.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b.%
fe008|fine by me fine by me.|s^aa
fe016|sure.|s^aa
me013|i like that.|s^ba
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|let's just|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and we'll see what we get.|s^cc
me013|we're all sufficiently tired of this that we're agreeing with you.|s
fe008|be easier on the subjects.|s^ba
fe008|i think that's fine.|s
me013|so|fg
fe008|no.|s^ar
fe008|i think|s.%--
fe008|i like that i like that.|s^ba^df
me013|you like it?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe008|yeah i do.|s^aa
me013|good.|b
me011|actually maybe we do one non english one as well.|s^cs
me011|southern cockney?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|yeah and|s^aa.%--
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me011|is that a real accent?|qy^rt
fe008|sure yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|s^aa.%
me011|how do you spell it?|qw
fe008|i think that's fine.|s
me013|cockney?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|c o|s.%--
me011|n e y?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|you could say liverpool.|s^cs
me013|liverpuddlian.|s
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|actually liverpool doesn't|s.%--
fe008|all right.|b
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|it's i'm i|s.%--
fe008|well well i mean pure|s.%--
me011|okay we'll do it that way.|s
me011|actually i like that a lot.|s^ba
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|because that get's at both of the things we were trying to do.|s^df
me011|the granularity and the person can just self assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are.|s
fe008|that's right.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|b
fe008|and it's easy on the subjects.|s^ba
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe008|now i have one suggestion on the next section.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|uhhuh.|s^bk^rt
fe008|so you have native language.|s^rt
fe008|you have region.|s^rt
fe008|and then you have time spent in english speaking country.|s^rt
fe008|now i wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying which one parenthesis s closed parenthesis.|s^cs:s
fe008|because if they spent time in in britain and america|s^df.%--
me013|yes.|s^aa
fe008|it doesn't have to be all at all exact just in the same open field format that you have.|s
me011|yep just which one.|s^na
me011|i think that's fine.|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
fe008|with a with an s.|s^cs^e
fe008|which one.|s:qw
fe008|sss optional s.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk^rt^tc
mn005|huh.|b
fe008|yeah.|b.%
me013|we uh we done?|qy^rt^t^tc
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe008|yeah that's good.|s^aa
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|um any any other uh open mike topics or should we go right to the digits?|fg|qr^rt
me011|um did you guys get my email on the multitrans?|fg|qy^rt
me011|that|%--
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe008|isn't that wonderful?|qh^ba
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|excellent!|s^ba^fe
me011|yeah so so i i have a version also which actually displays all the channels.|fg|s
fe008|thank you.|s^ft
fe016|it's really great.|s^ba
me011|but it's hideously slow.|s
fe008|so you this is dan's patches dan ellis's patches.|s^bu
me011|the what the ones i applied that you can actually do are dan's because it doesn't slow it down.|s
fe008|fantastic!|s^ba^fe
me011|just uses a lot of memory.|s
fe016|so when you say slow does that mean to|qy.%-
me011|no the the one that's installed is fine.|s
me011|it's not slow at all.|s
me011|i wrote another version which instead of having the one pane with the one view it has multiple panes with the views.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me011|but the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b.x
me011|it's really bad.|s^ba
fe016|it's so it it's the redrawing of the|s^bu.%-
fe008|that's a consideration.|s^t1
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|oh uhhuh.|s^bk
fe016|as you move.|s^bu
me011|as you play as you move as you scroll.|s
me011|just about anything and it it was so slow it was not usable.|s^df
fe008|and this'll be a having the multiwave will be a big help.|s
me011|so that's why i didn't install it and didn't pursue it.|s
fe008|because in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things that'll be a big help.|s^df
fe016|oh yeah.|s^aa
me011|so i think that the one dan has is usable enough.|fg|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|it doesn't display the others.|s
me011|it displays just the mixed signal.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|but you can listen to any of them.|s
fe008|that's excellent.|fg
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|he also has version control which is another nice|s.%--
fe008|so you the patches that you|s.%-
me011|no he suggested that but he didn't it's not installed.|s^ar|s
fe008|oh i thought it was in one of those patches.|s^df
me011|no no.|s^ar
fe008|oh okay.|s^bk
fe008|well all right.|s^bk
fe016|so is there any hope for actually displaying the wave form?|qy^rt
me011|um not if we're going to use tcl t. k. at least not if we're going to use snack.|s^nd
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|i mean you would have to do something ourselves.|s^e
fe008|well or use the one that crawls.|s^aap
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|well i'm i probably would be trying to use the whatever's there.|s
fe016|and it's useful to have the|s.%-
me011|why don't we we see how dan's works and if it if we really need the display|s^cs.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|i mean i wonder i'm just wondering if we can display things other than the wave form.|s
fe016|so suppose we have a feature a feature stream.|s
fe016|and it's just you know a a uni dimensional feature varying in time.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and we want to plot that instead of the whole wave form.|s
me011|i mean|%-
mn005|yeah.|b.%
fe016|that might be faster.|s
fe016|right?|qy^bu^d^g
mn005|yeah.|b.%
fe016|so|%-
me011|we we could do that but that would mean changing the code.|s^aap
me011|i mean this isn't a program we wrote.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|this is a program that we got from someone else and we've done patches on.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|okay well i'll talk to you about it and we can see.|s^cc
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b.%
me013|i mean|%-
me011|so|fh
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|but it's definitely great to have the other one.|s^ba
fe016|that's|%-
me013|if there was some is there some way to have someone write patches in something faster and and link it in or something.|s^bu^cs^rt
me013|or is that|qrr.%-
me011|not easily.|s^ar
me011|i mean yes we could do that.|s^aap^df
me011|you could you can write widgets in c.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me011|and try to do it that way but i just don't think it|s.%--
me011|let's try it with dan's and if that isn't enough we can do it otherwise.|s^cs
fe016|right.|b
me011|i think it is because when i was playing with it the mixed signal has it all in there.|s|s^df
me011|and so it's really it's not too bad to find places in the in the stream where things are happening.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe008|and it's also also the case that that uh this multi wave thing is proposed to the|s.%--
mn005|huh.|b.%
me011|so i i don't think it'll be bad.|s
fe008|so dan proposed it to the transcriber central people.|s
fe008|and it's likely that uh|s.%--
fe008|so and and they responded favorably.|s
fe008|looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version.|s
fe016|oh.|s^bk
fe008|they said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before was simply that they hadn't had time to do it.|s
fe008|and uh so it's likely that this this may be entered into the this central.|fh|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|they may well have not had much demand for it.|s
me011|and if if|%-
fe008|well that's that's that's true too.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|this is a a useful thing for us.|s^ba
fe016|so you mean they could they could do it and it would be fast enough if they do it?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|oh no i just mean i just mean that it's that that his|s^ar|s.%--
me011|depends on how much work they did.|s
fe016|or|qrr.%--
mn005|oh.|b.x
fe008|so this one that we now have does have the status of potentially being incorporated likely being incorporated into the central code.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe008|now now if we develop further then uh i don't|s.%--
fe008|i mean it's i think it's a nice feature to have it set that way.|s
me011|i think if if if one of us sat down and coded it so that it could be displayed fast enough i'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|but it's not a trivial task.|s
fe016|okay.|s
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|s^aa
fe008|i just like the idea of it being something that's you know tied back into the original so that other people can benefit from it.|s^df
me011|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|however i also understand that you can have widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that route.|s^ba
fe008|yeah.|b
mn005|okay.|b
me011|anyway shall we do digits?|fg|qy^rt^t^tc
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah let's do digits.|s^aa|s^co^rt
me013|uh and then we'll turn off the mikes and then i have one other thing to discuss.|s^co
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe016|i actually have to leave.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe016|so um i mean i had to leave at three thirty.|s
fe016|so i can well i can wait for the digits but i can't stay for the discussion.|s
fe008|uh oh!|s^bk^fe
me013|oh.|s^bk
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|well you want to go first or|qr.%--
fe016|i i have to make a call.|s^df
fe016|so|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|well we'll talk to you about it uh|s^t3.%--
fe008|well should we should we switch off the|qy^cs^rt.%--
fe016|um|fh
me011|do you want to go do digits or do you want to just skip digits?|qr
fe016|no i can do digits if if but i don't want to butt in or something.|s
me011|then all right you go ahead.|s^bk|s^co^t
fe016|but if there's something on the rest of the|s.%--
fe016|i'm i'll be around just have to make call before quarter of.|s
fe016|so|fh
mn005|uhhuh.|b.%
fe016|so i|s.%--
fe016|or we can talk about it.|s^cs
me011|why don't you read the digits?|qh^co
fe016|okay all right.|s^bk
me013|yeah why don't you read the digits and then you can go.|s^co^m^na
fe016|oh this is the new one.|s^rt
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yeah don't don't read the old one.|s^aa|s^co
fe016|all right.|b
fe016|the and the time is|s.%--
fe016|okay.|b
me011|okay.|z
me013|okay.|z
fe008|turn it off.|z
fe008|but wait till he|z
fe008|okay.|z
me011|and|z
me013|are we on?|z
me013|we're on.|z
me018|is it on?|z
me013|okay.|z
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|yeah.|z
mn005|one two|z
me013|okay.|fg
mn005|okay.|s^bk
fe016|why is it so cold in here?|qw
me013|so uh|fh
me013|we haven't sent around the agenda.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|uh any agenda items anybody has wants to talk about what's going on?|qo^rt
fe008|i i could talk about the meeting.|s^cs
me011|does everyone has everyone met don?|qy^rt
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|okay.|b
mn014|now yeah.|s^aa
me013|it's on?|qy^d^rt
me001|hello.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me001|yeah.|b
me013|okay agenda item one.|s
mn005|we went|s.%--
me013|introduce don.|s
me013|okay we did that.|s
me013|uh|fh
fe016|well i had a just a quick quest ion.|fg|s
fe016|but i know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that i missed.|s
fe016|but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close talking mikes on every speaker.|s
me013|okay so let's let's so let's just do agenda building right now.|s^bk|s
me013|okay so let's talk about that a bit.|s
fe016|i mean that was|s.%-
me013|uh close talking mikes.|s
me013|better quality.|s
me013|okay uh we can talk about that.|s^cc
me013|you were going to starting to say something?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|well you you um already know about the meeting that's coming up.|s^na^rt
fe008|and i don't know if if this is appropriate for this.|s
fe008|i don't know.|s^no
fe008|i mean maybe maybe it's something we should handle outside of the meeting.|s^cs
me018|what meeting?|qw^rt
me013|no no that's okay.|s^bd^rt|s^aa^rt
me013|we can so we can so nist is nist folks are coming by next week.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|yeah.|b.%
me013|and so we can talk about that.|s^cc^rt
me018|who's coming?|qw^rt
me013|i think|s.%-
me013|uh uh john fiscus.|fh|s^rt
fe008|uhhuh.|b.%
me013|and uh i think george doddington will be around as well.|s
me013|uh okay so we can talk about that.|fh|s
me013|uh i guess just hear about how things are going with uh uh the transcriptions.|s
fe008|sure uhhuh.|s^aa.%
me013|that's right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|that would sort of be an obvious thing to discuss.|s^rt^t
me013|um|fh
me013|anything else uh strike anybody?|qo^t
fe016|uh we started running recognition on one conversation.|s
fe016|but it's the isn't working yet.|s
fe016|so|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe016|but if anyone has|s.%--
fe016|uh the main thing would be if anyone has um knowledge about ways to uh post process the wave forms that would give us better recognition.|s
fe016|that would be helpful to know about.|s
me013|um|fg
me011|dome.|s
me011|yeah it sounds like a topic of conversation.|s^cs^na
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so uh|fh
me018|what about uh is there anything new with the speech nonspeech stuff?|qy^rt
mn014|yeah we're working more on it.|s^bk|s
mn014|but it's not finished.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|all right that seems like a a good collection of things.|s^t
me013|and we'll undoubtedly think of other things.|s
fe008|i had thought under my topic that i would mention.|s^t
fe008|the uh four items that i i uh put out for being on the agenda on that meeting.|s
fe008|which includes like the pre segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans.|s
me013|oh under the nist meeting.|s^bs
fe008|yeah under the nist thing.|s^m^na
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me013|okay.|s^bk^rt
me013|all right why don't we start off with this.|s^cs
me013|i guess the order we brought them up seems fine.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|so better quality close talking mikes.|fg|s
me013|so the one issue was that the the uh lapel mike uh isn't as good as you would like.|s
me013|and so uh it it'd be better if we had close talking mikes for everybody.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|is that is that basically the point?|qy^rt
fe016|um|h
fe016|yeah the|s^aa|%--
fe016|and actually in addition to that that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal.|s
fe016|and the reason here is just that for the people doing work|s.%--
fe016|not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth|s.%--
fe016|uh or and even on prosody|h|s.%--
fe016|which don is going to be working on soon.|s^rt
fe016|it adds this extra you know variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so and i also talked to mari this morning.|fh|s
fe016|and she also had a strong preference for doing that.|s
fe016|and in fact she said that that's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|right so one|fg|s.%-
me011|well so|fg|%-
me013|uh well one thing i was going to say was that um i we could get more uh of the head mounted microphones.|s
me013|even beyond the number of radio channels we have.|s
me013|because i think whether it's radio or wire is probably second order.|s
me013|and the main thing is having the microphone close to you.|s
me013|although not too close.|s^bd^df
fe016|uhhuh.|b.%
me011|right.|b
me011|so uh actually the way jose is wearing his is is correct.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|is|%--
me011|the good way.|s^e
me011|so you want to|s^co.%-
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|it's not it's correct?|qy^bu^rt
me013|is.|s^na
me011|yeah that's good.|s^na
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|so it's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it.|s
me013|yes.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|and then just sort of about uh a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth.|s^co
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|uh yeah.|s^bk
me013|right.|b
me013|how am i|qw.%-
fe016|but we have more than one type of|s.%--
fe016|i mean for instance you're|s.%-
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|and this one isn't very adjustable.|s
me011|so this about as good as i can get.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|because it's a fixed boom.|s
fe016|right.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|is fixed yeah.|s^2
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|but if we could actually standardize you know the the microphones uh as much as possible that would be really helpful.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|well i mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around.|fg|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of|s^cs.%--
me013|if this microphone seems okay to people.|s
me013|uh i'd just get a half dozen of these things.|s^cs
me011|well the the only problem with that is right now um some of the jimlets aren't working.|s
me011|the little the boxes under the table.|s^e
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me011|and so uh i've only been able to find three jacks that are working.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|can we get these wireless?|qy^rt
me011|so|fh
me013|no but my point is|s^ar|s.%-
fe016|but we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting.|s
me013|right|%-
me011|i i'm not sure i'm follow.|s^no
me011|say that again.|s^co^rt
me013|right now we've got uh two microphones in the room that are not quote unquote standard.|s
me013|so why don't we replace those|s^cs.%-
me011|okay just two?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|well however many we can plug in.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|you know if we can plug in three let's plug in three.|s
mn005|huh yeah.|b
me013|also what we've talked before about getting another uh radio.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|and so then that would be you know three more.|s
me011|right okay.|s^bk
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|so uh so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do.|s^co
me013|but have them all be the same mike.|s
me013|i think the original reason that it was done the other way was because it it was sort of an experimental thing.|s
me013|and i don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or uh more uniformity.|s
fe016|right.|b
me013|but but uh|fh
me013|sounds sounds fine.|s^ba
me011|sounds like uniformity wins.|s
mn005|right.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|well for short term research it's just there's just so much effort that would have to be done up front uh|s^df.%--
me011|well|fg
fe016|so yeah uniformity would be great.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me018|is it because|qy.%-
me018|you you're saying the for dialogue purposes?|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes?|qy^bu^rt
me018|is that what you mean?|qy^rt
me018|or|qrr.%--
fe016|well jane would know more about the transcribers.|s
fe008|and that's true.|s
fe008|i mean i we did discuss this.|s^cs
fe008|uh and and|fh
me011|yep.|s^bk
me011|couple times.|s^e
fe008|a couple times.|s^bk^m
fe008|so um yeah the transcribers notice|fh|s.%--
fe008|and in fact there're some where um|s.%--
fe008|ugh.|s
fe008|well i mean there's it's the double thing.|s
fe008|it's the equipment and also how it's worn.|s
fe008|and he's always they always they just rave about how wonderful adam's adam's channel is.|s
fe016|right.|b
me011|what can i say?|qr
fe008|and then|%-
fe016|so does the recognizer.|s
me011|oh really?|qh
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|yeah i'm not surprised.|s
me011|i mean baaah.|s:s^fe
fe008|yeah but i mean it's not just that it's also you know|fg|s.%--
fe016|even if if you're talking on someone else's mike it's still you|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|it's also like no breathing.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|no|s.%--
fe008|you know it's like it's it's um|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|it's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers' point of view.|s
me011|yeah it's an advantage when you don't breath.|s^j
fe008|and also from the research point of view.|s
me013|when we're doing|s.%-
me011|yeah i think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal we're not doing research on close talking mikes.|s^df
fe016|right.|b
fe008|yeah.|b.%
me011|so we might as well get it as uniform as we can.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|right.|b
me013|now this is locking the barn door after the horse was stolen.|s
me013|we do have thirty hours of of speech which is done this way.|s
me011|yeah.|s^ba
fe016|that's okay.|s^ba
me013|but|%--
me013|but uh yeah for future ones we can get it a bit more uniform.|fh|s
fe016|great great.|s^ba
me011|so i think just do a field trip at some point.|s
me013|yeah probably yeah to the store we talked about.|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|and that|%--
fe008|and there was some talk about uh maybe the headphones that are uncomfortable for people to|s.%-
me011|yep.|fg
me011|so as as i said we'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that's more comfortable than than these things which i think are horrible.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me011|so|fh
fe008|good.|s^ba
fe016|great thank you very much.|s^ba|s^ft
me018|especially for people with big heads.|s^2^j
me013|okay.|fg
fe016|it's makes our job a lot easier.|s
me011|and you know we're researchers.|s^df
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|so we all have big heads.|s^j
me018|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|uh|fg
me013|okay second item was the uh nist visit and what's going on there.|s^bk|s^t
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|okay so um uh|h
fe008|jonathan fiscus is coming on the second of february.|s
fe008|and i've spoken with uh a lot of people here.|s
fe008|not everyone.|s
fe008|um and um|fh
fe008|he expressed an interest in seeing the room.|s^rt
fe008|and in um seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans.|s^rt
fe008|which i'll mention in a second.|s^rt
fe008|and also um he was interested in the pre segmentation.|s^rt
fe008|and then he's also interested in the transcription conventions.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and um so um it seems to me in terms of like|fh|s.%--
fe008|um it|fh|%--
fe008|you know okay.|fh
fe008|so the room it's things like the audio and and audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room.|s
fe008|and how it how the recordings are done.|s
fe008|and that kind of thing.|s
fe008|and um okay in terms of the multi trans well that that's being modified by dave gelbart to uh handle multi channel recording.|s
me011|oh i should've|s.%-
me011|i was just thinking i should have invited him to this meeting.|s
me011|i forgot to do it.|s
me011|so|fh
fe008|yeah okay.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|sorry.|s^fa
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|well that's okay i mean we'll|s^bd|s.%--
fe008|yeah and it's and it looks really great.|fg|s
fe008|he he has a prototype.|s
fe008|i i uh didn't didn't see it uh yesterday.|s
fe008|but i'm going to see it today.|s
fe008|and uh that's that will enable us to do nice um tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments.|s
fe008|at present it's not possible with limitations of of the uh original design of the software.|s
fe008|and um|fh
fe008|so i don't know.|s^bd^no
fe008|in terms of like pre segmentation that that continues to be um a terrific asset to the to the transcribers.|s
fe008|do you i know that you're also supplementing it further.|s
fe008|do you want to mention something about that thilo?|qy^rt
fe008|or|qrr.%--
mn014|um yeah.|h|s^aa
mn014|what what i'm doing right now is i'm trying to include some information about which channel uh there's some speech in.|s
mn014|but that's not working at the moment.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk.%
mn014|i'm just trying to do this by comparing energies uh normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels.|s
mn014|and|fh
mn014|so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there's there's speech in addition to to the thing we we did.|s
mn014|now which is just uh speech nonspeech detection on the mixed file.|s
fe008|this is good uhhuh.|s^bk
mn014|so i'm i'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file.|s
mn014|but i'm i'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in in different channels.|s
fe008|excellent so this would be like providing also speaker i d potentially.|s^bu
mn014|but|fg
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|yeah.|s^aa^r
fe008|wonderful.|s^ba
fe008|wonderful.|b
me013|um something i guess i didn't put in the list but uh on that uh same day later on in|fg|s^t.%--
me013|or maybe it's no actually it's this week.|s^bsc
me013|uh dave gelbart and i will be uh visiting with john canny.|fh|s
me013|who you know is a c s professor.|s^e
fe008|oh.|b.%
me011|h c c.|s^2
me013|who's interested in in array microphones.|s^e
me011|oh he's doing array mikes.|s^bu
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|and so we want to see what commonality there is here.|s
me013|you know maybe they'd want to stick an array mike here when we're doing things.|s^cs
me018|that would be cool.|s^ba
me011|yeah that would be neat.|s^ba
me013|or or maybe it's it's not a specific array microphone they want.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|that would be really neat.|s^ba^m
me013|but they might want to just uh you know you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them.|s^cs
me013|um i also had a discussion|fh|s.%--
me013|so uh we'll be over over there talking with him um after class on friday.|s
me013|um we'll let you know what what goes with that.|fh|s^cc
me013|also had a completely unrelated thing i had a uh discussion today with uh birger kollmeier who's a uh a german uh scientist.|s^tc
me013|who's got a fair sized group doing a range of things.|s^e
me013|it's sort of auditory related largely for hearing aids and so on.|s^e
me013|but|fh
me013|but uh he does stuff with auditory models and he's very interested in directionality and location and and uh head models and microphone things.|s
me013|and so uh he's he and possibly a student there|fh|s.%--
me013|there's uh a student of his who gave a talk here last year.|s
me013|uh may come here uh in the fall for uh sort of a five month uh sabbatical.|s
me013|so he might be around.|s
me013|get him to give some talks and so on.|s
me013|but anyway he might be interested in this stuff.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me018|that that reminds me i had a a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here.|s^cs^tc
me018|either using you know the the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes.|s^cs^e
mn005|uhhuh.|b^rt
me018|and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting.|s^cs^e
me013|right.|s^bk
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|well dan dan had worked on that dan ellis.|s^ng
me018|uh based on|fh|s.%-
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me018|oh did he?|qy^bu^rt
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me018|oh that's interesting.|s^ba
me011|so that that's the cross correlation stuff was was doing beam forming.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|and so you could plot out who was sitting next to who.|s^bu
me018|and|fh
me013|a little bit.|s^na
me013|i mean he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of|s.%-
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|no.|s^ar
me011|he did start on it.|s^nd
me013|given that the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|if i'm speaking or if you're speaking or someone over there is speaking it if you look at cross correlation functions you end up with a|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking then you you get a big peak there.|s
me013|and if if someone's talking on on on uh one side or the other it goes the other way.|s
me018|uhhuh.|s^bk
me013|and then uh it it it even looks different if if the two two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle.|s
me013|it it actually looks somewhat different.|s^r
me018|huh.|b
me013|so|fh
me018|well i was just thinking you know as i was sitting here next to thilo that um when he's talking my mike probably picks it up better than your guys's mikes.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|so if you just looked at|s^cs.%-
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me011|oh that's another cue.|s^2^bk
me011|that's true.|s^aa
me018|yeah looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who's closest to who.|fg|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|and|fh
me011|or who talks the loudest.|s^2^j
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah well you have to the appropriate normalizations are tricky and and and are probably the key.|fg|s
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|you just search for adam's voice on each individual microphone you pretty much know where everybody's sitting.|s^j
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|yeah we've switched positions recently so you can't.|fg|s^ng
me013|anyway.|s^tc
me013|okay.|s^tc
me013|so those are just a little couple of news items.|s^t
fe008|can i ask one thing?|qy^rt^t
fe008|uh so um|fh
fe008|jonathan fiscus expressed an interest in uh microphone arrays.|s
me013|yes.|s^aa
fe008|um is there|fh|qy.%--
fe008|i mean and i also want to say his he can't stay all day.|s
fe008|he needs to uh leave for uh from here to make a two forty five flight.|s
me011|oh so just morning.|s^bk
fe008|from from oakland.|s^e
me013|right.|s^aa
fe008|so it makes the scheduling a little bit tight.|s
fe008|but do you think that um that uh john canny should be involved in this somehow or not?|qr^cs
fe008|i have no idea.|s^no
me013|probably not.|s^ar
me013|but i i'll i'll i'll know better after i see him this friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved.|s^e
fe008|it's premature.|s^nd
fe008|fine.|s^bk
fe008|good.|s^bk
me013|uh he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to uh or he might have no interest whatsoever.|s
me013|i i just really don't know.|s^no
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me011|is he involved in|qy.%--
me011|ach i'm blanking on the name of the project.|s
me011|nist has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays and very elaborate software.|s
me011|is is he the one working on that?|qy^rt
me013|well that's what they're starting up.|s^na
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah no i mean that's what all this is about they they haven't done it yet.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|they wanted to do it.|s^e
me011|i had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work.|s
me013|uh well i think they've instrumented a room.|s
me013|but i don't think they they haven't started recordings yet.|s
me013|they don't have the the transcription standards.|s
me018|are they going to do video as well?|qy^rt
me013|they don't have the|s.%-
me011|huh|b.%
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me018|huh.|b
me013|i think.|s^am
me013|i think they are.|s^am^r
me011|oh because what what i had read was uh they had a uh very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this.|s
me011|both in terms of recording and also live room where you're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer and with the video and lots of other stuff.|s^e
me013|well i'm i'm i'm not sure.|s^no
me011|so|fh
me013|all all i know is that they've been talking to me about a project that they're going to start up recording people in meetings.|s
me011|okay well|fg
me013|and uh it is related to ours.|s
me013|they were interested in ours.|s
me013|they wanted to get some uniformity with us uh about the transcriptions and so on.|s
me011|all right.|b
me013|and one one notable difference|s.%--
me013|actually i can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not.|s^no
me013|but one one uh difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes.|s
me013|so um i mean i'll just tell you the party line on that.|fh|s
me013|the reason i didn't go for that here was because uh the focus uh both of my interest and of adam's interest was uh in impromptu situations.|s^df
me013|and|fh
me013|we're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations.|s
me013|but that's because it's different to get data for research than to actually apply it.|s^df
mn005|huh|b
me013|and so uh for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it.|s^df
me013|but the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with uh one or more other people uh in in an impromptu way where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be.|s
me013|and therefore it would not it'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones.|s
me013|um so it was only for that reason it was just you know yet another piece of research.|fh|s^df
me013|and it seemed like we had enough troubles just|s.%-
me018|so there's no like portable array of mikes?|qy^bu^rt
me013|no so there's there's uh there's a whole range of things there's a whole array of things that people do on this.|s^ar|s^ng
mn005|huh|b
me013|so um|fh
me013|the uh the big arrays|s.%--
me013|uh places uh like uh rutgers and brown and other other places.|s^e
me013|uh they have uh big arrays with i don't know a hundred hundred mikes or something.|s
me011|xerox.|s.%
me013|and so there's a wall of mikes.|s
me013|and you get really really good beam forming with that sort of thing.|s
me018|wow!|s^fe
me013|and it's and um|s.%--
me013|in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with rutgers where we were going to do some of the sort of per channel signal processing.|s
me013|and they were going to do the multi channel stuff.|s
me013|but it it we ended up not doing it.|s
me013|but|fh
me018|i've seen demonstrations of the microphone arrays it's amazing how how they can cut out noise.|s
me013|yeah it's it's really neat stuff.|s^ba
me011|and then they have little ones too.|s
me013|and then they had the little ones yeah.|s^aa^m
me011|but i mean but they don't have our block of wood.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|yeah our block of wood is unique.|s^aa|s^j
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but the but the|%--
me013|no there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|and and uh|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|so yeah there's there's there's a range of things that people do.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|um so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that's that's a good thing to do.|fh|s
me013|i mean whenever i've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that's invariably the question they ask.|s
me013|just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask um are you recording video.|s:qy
me013|um right?|fh|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|right.|s^aa
me013|and and the acoustic people will always say well are you doing uh uh array microphones.|s:qy
fe016|right.|s^aa^r
me013|so it's it's a good thing to do but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined p d a that we have.|s
me013|so maybe maybe we'll do some more of it.|s^cs
fe008|well one thing i i mean i don't know|s^cs.%--
fe008|i mean i know that having an array of i mean i would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones.|s
fe008|but couldn't you kind of approximate the natural situation by just shutting off uh channels when you're later on?|qy^cs^rt
fe008|i mean it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just you know record them with an array and then just not use all the data?|qy^cs^rt
me011|it's it's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up.|s^ng
fe008|i see.|s^bk
fe008|fine.|s^bk
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|it's okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah if ninety nine percent of what you're doing is is shutting off most of the mikes then going through the|s.%--
me013|but if you get somebody who's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction.|s
me011|that's right i mean if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it.|s
fe016|right.|s^aa
me011|i mean we don't care.|s
me011|that would be fine.|s^ba
me018|so to save that data you you have to have one channel recording per mike in the array?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|buy more disk space.|s
me018|is that|qy.%-
me013|well uh at some level at some level.|h|s^aap
me011|i usually do a mix.|s
me013|but then you know there's it there's|s.%-
me018|what you save i mean if you're going to do research with it yeah.|s^e
me013|there's|%--
me013|i i don't know what they're going to do and i don't know how big their array is.|s^no
me013|obviously if you were going to save all of those channels for later research you'd use up a lot of space.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me011|well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters and mixers and all sorts of processing.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|and|%-
me011|so that they can do stuff in real time and not save out each channel individually.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|huh|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so it was uh|%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but i mean uh for optimum flexibility later you'd want to save each channel.|s^cs
me013|but i think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional.|s^cs
me018|uh oh okay i see.|s^bk
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|so|fh
fe016|i mean it seems|s.%-
me018|sort of saving the result of the beam forming.|s^bs
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|it seems to me that there's you know there are good political reasons for for doing this.|s
fe016|just getting the data.|s^e
fe016|because there's a number of sites|s^df.%--
fe016|like right now s r i is probably going to invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also which is good.|s^df
fe016|um but they'll be recording with video.|fh|s
fe016|and they'll be|s.%--
fe016|you know it'd be nice if we can have at least uh make use of the data that we're recording as we go.|s^cs
fe016|since it's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings.|s^df
fe016|um and just have this other information available.|s
fe016|so if we can get the investment in just for the infrastructure|s^cs.%--
fe016|and then|%--
fe016|i don't know.|s^bd
fe016|save it out|s^cs.%--
fe016|or have whoever's interested|s^cs.%--
fe016|save that data out.|s^cs
fe016|transfer it there.|s^cs
fe016|it'd be it'd be good to have have the recording i think.|s
me011|you mean to to actually get a microphone array and do that?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|well if|%-
me011|and video and|qy^d^g.%--
fe016|even if we're not|%-
fe016|i'm not sure about video.|s^no^rt
fe016|that's sort of an video has a little different nature since|s^df.%--
fe016|right right now we're all being recorded but we're not being taped.|s
fe016|um but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays since if there was a community interested in this then|s.%-
me011|well but i think we need a researcher here who's interested in it to push it along.|fg|s^cs^ng
me013|see the problem is it it took uh uh it took at least six months for dan to get together the hardware and the software and debug stuff in in the microphones and in the boxes.|s
me013|and it was a really big deal.|s^ba
me013|and so i think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily.|s
me013|and uh have it mixed to to one channel of some sort.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|but i think for|s.%--
me013|i mean how we're going to decide|qw.%--
me013|for for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that's pointed in the direction of the the the the person with the maximum energy or something like that.|s
me013|i mean you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can|s^cs.%--
me013|and to do that it we're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up.|s
me013|we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels.|s
me013|and in this meeting we've got eight people and and six mikes.|s
me013|and there we're already using fourteen.|s^rt
me011|and we actually only have fifteen.|s^bc
me011|one of them's|%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|details.|s
me011|but fifteen not sixteen.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|well if there's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these those|s^cs.%--
fe016|so suppose you can get an array in because there's some person at berkeley who's interested and has some equipment.|s
fe016|uh and suppose we can as we save it we can you know transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data.|s
fe016|who's interested.|s
fe016|and even if icsi itself isn't.|s
fe016|um and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning do we need to mix it with the rest?|qy^rt
fe016|i don't know.|s^no^rt
fe016|you know|%--
me013|yeah so i think you'd need a separate a separate set up.|fg|s
fe016|so|fh
me013|and the assumption that you could time align the two.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|and it'd certainly gets skew.|s
fe016|i mean it's just it's worth considering as sort of|s^cs.%--
fe016|once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time and and not have to worry about the disk space factor then it it might be worth having the data.|s
me013|i'm not so much worried about disk space actually.|s^nd
me013|i mentioned that as a practical matter.|s
me011|just|%-
me013|but the real issue is that uh there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew.|s
me013|so you would have a completely separate set up.|s
me013|which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this.|s
fe016|right.|b
me013|so it would depend on the level of processing you were doing later.|s
me013|but if you're the kind of person who's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times.|s
me013|and and so you actually would want to have a completely different set up than we have.|s^rt
fe016|i see.|s^bk
me013|one that would go up to thirty two channels or something.|s
fe016|huh.|b
me013|so basically|s.%-
me011|or a hundred thirty two.|s^aap
me013|or a|s^aa^m.%--
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so i'm kind of skeptical.|s
me013|but um i think that|s.%--
fe016|huh.|b
me013|so uh i don't think we can share the resource in that way.|s^rt
me013|but what we could do is if there was someone else who's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours.|s
me013|which might be useful for for them.|s
fe016|right i mean at least they'd have the data and the transcripts.|s^bk|s^aap
me013|and then we can offer up the room.|s^rt
fe016|and|fh
me013|yeah we can offer the meetings and the physical space.|s^aa|s
fe016|right.|b
me013|and and yeah the transcripts and so on.|s
fe016|okay.|b
fe016|right i mean just it'd be nice if we have more information on the same data.|fg|s
fe016|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|and|fh
fe016|but it's if it's impossible or if it's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two.|s
me013|well i|s.%--
me013|yeah the thing will be in in again in talking to these other people to see what you know what what we can do.|fh|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|right.|b
me013|uh we'll see.|s^cc
me018|is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings?|qy^rt
me018|i mean|s.%--
me013|right so we have we|fg|%-
me011|yes absolutely but it's exactly the same problem.|s^aa|s
me011|that you have an infrastructure problem.|s
me011|you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped.|s
me011|and you have the problem that no one who's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it.|s
me018|huh.|b
me018|so there's not enough interest to overcome all of|s^bs.%-
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right internally.|s^aa|s
fe016|but i know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video.|s
fe016|so it's just|s.%-
fe008|yeah although i i i have to mention the human subjects problems that increase with video.|fg|s
fe016|right that's true.|s^bk|s^na
me013|yeah so it's uh people people getting shy about it.|fg|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|there's this human subjects problem.|s
me013|there's the fact that then um if|s.%--
me013|i've heard comments about this before.|s
me013|why don't you just put on a video camera.|s:qw
me013|but you know it's sort of like saying uh well we're primarily interested in in some dialogue things.|s
me013|uh but uh why don't we just throw a microphone out there?|qo^df
me013|i mean the thing is once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|and uh you really want to do it right.|s^cs
me011|i know.|s^bk
me011|yep.|b
me013|so i think nist or l d c or somebody like that i think is much better shape to do all that.|s
me013|we there will be other meeting recordings we won't be the only place doing meeting recordings.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|we are doing what we're doing.|s
me013|and uh hopefully it'll be useful.|s^ba
fe008|i it it occurred to me has don signed a human subject's form?|qy^rt
me011|oh probably not.|s
fe008|a permission form?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|has don have you did you|qy.%--
me011|i thought you did actually.|s
me011|didn't you read a digit string?|qy^rt
me001|i was yeah i was i was here i was here before once.|s
me018|you were here at a meeting before.|s^bu
fe008|you were here at a meeting before.|s^bu
me011|yeah and you and you signed a form.|s^bk|s^bu
me018|yeah.|b
me001|so|fh
fe008|did you sign a form?|qy^rt
me001|oh i think so.|s^am
me001|did i?|qy^rt^t1
me011|i'm pretty sure.|s
me001|i don't know.|s^no
me011|well i'll i'll get another one before the end of the meeting.|s^cc
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me011|thank you.|s^ft^tc
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me001|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|you don't you don't have to leave for it.|s
fe008|but i just|s.%--
me013|yeah we we|s.%-
fe008|you know.|s^f
me011|well i can't.|s
me001|can i verbally consent?|qy^rt
me011|i'm wired in.|s^df
me013|we we we we don't uh|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|you're on you're being recorded.|s
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|and|fh
me001|i don't care.|s
me013|we don't we don't perform electro shock during these meetings.|s^j
me001|you can do whatever you want with it.|s^cs
me001|that's fine.|s^ba
me013|and|fh
me018|usually.|s^2^j
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|uh transcriptions.|fg|s
fe008|transcriptions okay.|s^bk^m
fe008|um i thought about there are maybe three aspects of this.|s
fe008|so first of all um i've got eight transcribers.|s
fe008|uh seven of them are linguists.|s^rt
fe008|one of them is a graduate student in psychology.|s^rt
fe008|um each i gave each of them uh their own data set.|s^rt
fe008|two of them have already finished the data sets.|s
fe008|and the meetings run you know let's say an hour sometimes as much as an hour and a half.|s
me018|how big is the data set?|qw^rt
fe008|oh it's what i mean is one meeting.|s
fe008|each each person got their own meeting.|s
me018|uh okay.|s^bk
fe008|i didn't want to have any conflicts of you know of of when to stop transcribing this one.|s
fe008|or|fh
fe008|so i wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose.|s
fe008|and and and so|fh
me018|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe008|and uh meetings you know i think that they're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases.|s
fe008|so you know that means|s.%--
fe008|you know if we've got two already finished and they're working on|s.%--
fe008|uh right now all eight of them have uh uh additional data sets that means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month.|s
fe008|hope so.|s^ba
me018|wow!|s^ba^fe
fe008|but the pre segmentation really helps a huge amount.|s
mn014|okay.|b
fe008|and uh also dan ellis's innovation of the uh the multi channel to here really helped a a lot in terms of clearing clearing up hearings that involve overlaps.|s
fe008|but um|fh
fe008|just out of curiosity i asked one of them how long it was taking her one of these two who has already finished her data set.|s
fe008|she said it takes about uh sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time.|s
fe008|so it's about twelve to one.|s
fe008|which is what we were thinking.|s^e
me011|or|%--
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe008|it's well in the range.|s
me011|it's pretty good.|s^ba
fe008|okay uh these still when they're finished um that means that they're finished with their pass through they still need to be edited and all.|s^bk|s
fe008|but but it's word level speaker change the things that were mentioned.|s
fe008|okay now i wanted to mention the um teleconference i had with uh jonathan fiscus.|s^t^tc
fe008|we spoke for an hour and a half.|s
me011|huh.|b
fe008|and um had an awful lot of things in common.|s
fe008|he um um he indicated to me that they've that he's been|s.%--
fe008|uh looking uh uh spending a lot of time with|s.%--
fe008|i'm not quite sure the connection.|s^no
fe008|but spending a lot of time with the atlas system.|s
fe008|and i guess that i mean i i need to read up on that.|s
fe008|and there's a web site that has lots of papers.|s
fe008|but it looks to me like that's the name that has developed for the system that bird and liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|so what he wants me to do|s.%--
fe008|and what we what we will do and uh is to provide them with the already transcribed meeting.|s
fe008|for him to be able to experiment with in this atlas system.|s
fe008|and they do have some sort of software.|s
fe008|at least that's my impression related to atlas.|s
fe008|and that he wants to experiment with taking our data.|s
fe008|and putting them in that format and see how that works out.|s
fe008|i i i explained to him in in detail the uh conventions that we're using here in this in this word level transcript.|s
fe008|and um|fh
fe008|you know i i explained you know the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately.|s
fe008|and and the focus on reliability.|s
fe008|he expressed a lot of interest in reliability.|s
fe008|it's like he's he's really up on these things.|s^ba
fe008|he's he's very|s.%--
fe008|um independently he asked well what about reliability.|s:qw
fe008|so he's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing.|s
fe008|okay um|fh
fe016|sorry.|fg
fe016|can you explain what the atlas|qy^rt.%--
fe016|i'm not familiar with this atlas system.|s^rt
fe008|well you know at this point i think|s.%--
fe008|uh well adam's read more in more detail than i have on this.|s^bd^df
fe008|i need to acquaint myself more with it.|s
fe008|but um there there is a way of viewing|fh|s.%--
fe008|uh whenever you have coding categories um and you're dealing with uh a taxonomy then you can have branches that that have alternative uh choices that you could use for each each of them.|s
fe008|and it just ends up looking like a graphical representation.|s
me011|is is|qy.%-
me011|is atlas the his annotated transcription graph stuff?|qy^rt
me011|i don't remember the acronym.|s^no.x
me011|the the one the what i think you're referring to they they have this concept of an annotated transcription graph representation.|s.x
me011|and that's basically what i based the format that i did|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|oh oh.|s^bk
me011|i based it on their work almost directly in combination with the t e i stuff.|s
me011|and so it's very very similar.|s
me011|and so it's it's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types.|s
me018|is this the project that's sort of uh between uh nist and and uh a couple of other places?|qy^rt
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|including l d c.|s^2
me018|the the|%-
fe008|i think so.|s^am
me011|yep.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me018|right.|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh then there's their web site that has lots of papers.|s
me018|okay.|b
fe008|and i looked through them.|s^e
fe008|and they mainly had to do with this um this uh tree structure uh annotated tree diagram thing.|s^e
fe016|huh.|b
fe008|so um um and you know in terms of like the conventions that i'm that i've adopted it there there's no conflict at all.|fh|s
me011|right.|s^aa
fe008|and he was you know very interested.|s
fe008|and oh and how'd you handle this.|s:qw
fe008|and i said well you know this way.|s:s
fe008|and and and we had a really nice conversation.|s
fe008|um okay now i also wanted to say in a different a different direction is brian kingsbury.|fh|s
fe008|so um i corresponded briefly with him.|fh|s
fe008|i uh i|%--
fe008|he still has an account here.|s
fe008|i told him he could s s h on and use multi trans and have a look at the already done uh transcription and he and he did.|s
fe008|and what he said was that um what they'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information.|s
fe008|and um that's uh you know i need to get back to him and and uh you know explore that a little bit more and see what they'll be giving us in specific.|fh|s^cc
fe016|huh.|b
me018|the the people|%-
fe008|but i just haven't had time yet.|s^df
fe008|sorry what?|qw^br^rt
me018|the the folks that they're uh subcontracting out the transcription to are they like court reporters?|qy^rt
fe008|yes.|b
me018|or|qrr.%--
fe008|apparently well i get the sense they're kind of like that like it's like a pool of of somewhat uh secretarial.|s^ng
fe008|i don't think that they're court reporters.|s
fe008|i don't think they have the special keyboards and that and that type of training.|s
fe008|i i get the sense they're more secretarial.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and that um uh what they're doing is giving them|s.%-
me018|huh.|b
me018|like medical transcriptionist type people?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|it's mostly it's for their speech recognition products.|s
fe008|yep.|s^aa
me011|that they've hired these people to do.|s^e^rt
me018|but aren't they're|s.%-
me018|oh so they're hiring them they're coming it's not a service they send the tapes out to.|s^bu
me011|well they they do send it out.|s^nd
me011|but my understanding is that that's all this company does is transcriptions for i b m for their speech product.|s^e
me018|uh!|s^fe
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|i gotcha.|s^bk
me011|so most of it's viavoice people reading their training material for that.|s
me018|i see.|s^bk
fe008|uhhuh.|b.%
me018|i see.|s^bk
fe008|up to now it's been monologues uh as far my understood it.|s
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|exactly.|s^aa
fe008|and and what they're doing is|s.%--
me011|yep.|s^aa
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe008|brian himself downloaded so so um adam sent them a c d and brian himself downloaded|s.%--
fe008|uh because you know i mean we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar terms with what they wanted to do.|s^df
fe008|he downloaded from the c d onto audio tapes.|s
fe008|and apparently he did it one channel per audio tape.|s
fe008|so each of these people is transcribing from one channel.|s
me011|right.|b.%
fe008|and then what he's going to do is check it.|s
me018|oh!|s^fe
fe008|before they go beyond the first one.|s^e
fe008|check it and you know adjust it and all that.|s
me018|so each person gets one of these channels.|s^bu
me011|right.|s^aa
me018|okay.|s^bk
me013|so if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go|s^bu.%--
me011|well but that's okay because you know you'll do all them and then combine them.|s^na
fe008|i i don't know.|s^no
fe008|i have i you know i|s.%-
me018|but there could be problems right with that?|qy^d
mn014|yep.|s^aa.%
fe008|i think it would be difficult to do it that way i really do.|s^na
fe016|yeah.|b
me018|well if you're if you got that channel right there|s^cs.%-
fe008|uh in my case|%-
me011|no no we're talking about close talking not the not the desktop.|s^nd
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|no close talk.|s^m
me013|are you?|qy^bu^rt
fe008|yes.|s^aa
me011|i sure hope so.|s^na
fe008|well i i think so.|s^na
me011|it'd be really foolish to do otherwise.|s^ba
fe008|yeah i i would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with yeah.|s
fe016|i i think it's sort of hard just playing the you know just having played the individual files.|s
fe016|and i i mean i know you i know what your voice sounds like i'm sort of familiar with|s.%--
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|uh it's pretty hard to follow especially|s.%--
me011|one side.|s^2
fe008|i agree.|s^aa
fe016|there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me018|that's|%--
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|and especially since a lot of these|s.%-
fe016|uh it sort of depends where you are in|s.%-
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|but i mean we had this we've had this discussion many times.|s
me011|and the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways.|s
fe008|yeah we have.|s^aa
fe008|well except i can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly.|s^ng
me011|so|fh
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe008|unless there's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix.|s^e
me018|right.|b
fe008|in which case you know they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel.|s
me011|right.|b
fe008|then they'll switch between.|s
me011|well i think that that might change if you wanted really fine time markings.|s^ng
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|but but really|%-
fe008|well okay.|fg|s^aa
me011|so|fh
fe008|yeah well|fg
me013|but they're not giving really fine time markings.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
fe016|actually are so are they giving any time markings?|qy^rt
fe016|in other words if|s.%-
fe008|well i have to ask him.|s^no
fe008|and that's that's my email to him that needs to be forthcoming.|s^cc
fe016|yeah|fh
fe016|because|%-
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe008|but but the uh i did want to say that it's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people.|fh|s
fe008|and if you're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you've never heard of.|s
fe008|so you know one of these people was was transcribing the uh networks group talk.|s
fe008|and she said i don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are.|s:s
fe008|but i just put them in parentheses because that's the that's the convention and i just|s.%--:s.%--
fe008|because you know if you don't know|s.%-
me011|oh i'd be curious to to look at that.|s
me018|just out of curiosity i mean|s.%-
me011|they also all have heavy accents.|s
me011|the networks group meetings are all|s.%--
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have i b m doing it?|qw
me018|why not just do it all ourselves?|qw
me013|um it's historical.|h|s
me013|i mean|fh
me013|uh some point ago we thought that uh it boy we'd really have to ramp up to do that.|s
mn005|no just|%-
mn014|uhhuh.|b
me013|you know like we just did.|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|and um here's uh a a uh collaborating institution that's volunteered to do it.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|so that was a contribution they could make uh in terms of time money you know.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|and it still might be a good thing.|s^cs
me018|i'm just wondering now|s.%-
me013|but|fh
me018|well i'm i'm wondering now if it's|s^r.%-
fe016|yeah mari asked me the same question as sort of|s.%-
me011|well we can talk about more details later.|s^co
fe016|um you know|fh|%--
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|whether to|%-
me013|yeah.|s^bk^r
me013|yeah.|b
me013|so|b
me018|huh|b
me013|we'll see.|s^co
me013|i mean i think you know they they they've proceeded along a bit let's see what comes out of it and and uh you know have some more discussions with them.|s^co
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|it's very a real benefit having brian involved.|s^ba
fe008|because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what's useful to have in the format.|s^df
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|so um liz with with the s r i recognizer can it make use of some time marks?|fg|qy^rt
fe016|okay so this is a um|h|s.%-
me011|i i guess i don't know what that means.|s^no
fe016|and actually i should say this is what don has uh he's already been really helpful in uh chopping up these.|s
fe016|so so first of all you|s.%--
fe016|um i mean for the s r i front end we really need to chop things up into pieces that are not too huge.|fh|s
fe016|um but second of all uh in general because some of these channels.|fh|s
fe016|i'd say like i don't know at least half of them probably on average are are are|s.%--
fe016|have a lot of cross ta|%--
fe016|sorry some of the segments have a lot of cross talk.|s^bsc
fe016|um it's good to get sort of short segments if you're going to do recognition.|fh|s
fe016|especially forced alignment.|s^e
fe016|so|fh
fe016|uh don has been taking a first stab actually using jane's first the the meeting that jane transcribed.|s
fe016|which we did have some problems with.|s
fe016|and thilo uh i think told me why this was.|s
fe016|but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning.|s^rt
fe016|so|fh
fe016|the s r i|%-
mn014|no yeah no they they were not switching them but what they were they were adjusting them.|s^ar|s^ng
fe016|and they|%-
fe016|they were not|%-
me001|huh|b
me011|adjusting oh.|s^m
mn014|so|fh
fe016|yeah.|fg
mn014|and after a minute or so it's it's way better.|s
mn014|so|fh
fe016|so we have to sort of normalize the front end and so forth and have these small segments.|fg|s
mn014|yep.|b
fe016|so we've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your um cuts that you made on the mixed signal.|s
fe016|and so that every every speaker has the same cuts.|s
fe016|and if they have speech in it we run it through.|s
fe016|and if they don't have speech in it we don't run it through.|s
fe016|and we base that knowledge on the transcription.|s
me011|on just on the marks.|s^2
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|um the problem is if we have no time marks|fh|s.%--
fe016|then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know in the signal the transcriber heard that word.|s
fe016|and so|fh
me011|oh i see.|s^bk
me011|it's for the length.|s^bs
fe016|i mean if if it's a whole conversation and we get a long uh you know paragraph of of talk.|s
me011|i see.|s^bk
fe016|uh i don't know how they do this.|s^no
fe016|um we actually don't know which piece goes where.|fh|s^no
me011|i understand.|s^bk
fe016|and um i think with|fh|s.%-
me018|well you would need to like a forced alignment before you did the chopping.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|no we used the fact that|s^ar|s^ng.%--
fe016|so when jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this.|s
me011|it's already chunked.|s^2
fe016|whether it's with the pre segmentation or not.|s
fe016|they have a chunk and then they transcribes the words in the chunk.|s
fe016|and maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre segmentation and then correct it if necessary.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|but there's first a chunk and then a transcription.|s
fe016|then a chunk then a transcription.|s
fe016|that's great.|s^ba
fe016|because the recognizer can|s^df.%-
me011|uh it's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also.|s^2
fe016|right and it it helps that it's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear i think.|s^aa|s
fe008|good.|s^ba
fe008|oh good.|b
fe016|but there's going to be a real problem.|s
fe016|uh even if we chop up based on speech silence these uh the transcripts from i b m we don't actually know where the words were.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
fe016|which segment they belonged to.|s^e
fe016|so that's sort of what i'm worried about right now.|s
me018|why not do a a a forced alignment?|qw
me011|that's what she's saying is that you can't.|s^nd
fe016|if you do a forced alignment on something really|s.%-
me011|got uh sixty minutes of|s.%-
fe016|well even if you do it on something really long you need to know|s.%--
fe016|you can always chop it up.|s
fe016|but you need to have a reference of which words went with which uh chop.|s
fe008|now wasn't i thought that one of the proposals was that i b m was going to do an initial forced alignment.|s^bu
fe016|so|fh
fe008|after they|s^e.%-
me011|yeah but|s^aap.%-
me013|i i think that they are.|s^am
me011|we'll have to talk to brian.|s^co
me013|um|fh
me013|yeah i'm sure they will.|s^aa
me013|and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it.|s^co
fe016|yeah.|fg
me013|i mean it sounds like liz has some concerns.|s
fe016|maybe they have some you know maybe actually there is some even if they're not fine grained maybe the transcribers|s.%--
me013|and|fh
fe016|uh i don't know maybe it's saved out in pieces or or something that would help.|fh|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|but|fh
fe016|uh it's just an unknown right now.|s^no
fe008|yeah i i need to to write to him.|fg|s^cc
fe016|so|fh
fe008|i just you know it's like i got over taxed with the timing.|s^df
fe016|right but the it is true that the segments i haven't tried the segments that thilo gave you.|fg|s
fe016|but the segments that in your first meeting are great.|s^ba
fe008|uhhuh.|fh
fe016|i mean that's that's a good length.|s^ba^e
fe008|a good size.|s^bk^m
fe008|good.|s^bk
fe016|right because|fg|%-
fe008|well i i was thinking it would be fun to to uh uh if if you wouldn't mind to give us a pre segmentation.|s^cs
fe016|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|uh maybe you have one already of that first of the meeting that uh the first transcribed meeting.|s
fe008|the one that i transcribed.|s
fe008|do you have a could you generate a pre segmentation?|qy^rt
mn014|um i'm sure i have some.|h|s
me011|february sixteenth i think.|s
mn014|but but that's the one where we're um training on.|s
mn014|so that's a little bit|s.%--
me011|oh.|s^bk
fe008|oh i see.|s^bk
fe008|oh darn.|s^ba
mn014|it's a little bit at odd to|s^r.%-
fe008|of course of course of course.|s^aa
fe008|yeah okay.|s^bk
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|and actually as you get transcripts just um for new meetings um we can try|s^cs.%--
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|i mean the the more data we have to try the the alignments on um the better.|fh|s
fe016|so it'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers.|s
fe016|just to sort of we're playing around with sort of uh parameters on the recognizer.|s^cs
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|because that would be helpful.|s^ba
fe008|excellent good.|s^aa
fe016|especially as you get more voices.|s
fe016|the first meeting had i think just four people.|s^e
mn014|four speakers.|s^2^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|yeah liz and i spoke at some length on tuesday.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|and and i and i was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you.|s^cc
fe016|oh great.|s^bk
fe016|great.|s^bk^r
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|so|b
me013|that's great.|s^ba
me013|i guess the other thing|s.%--
me013|i i can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but uh i know you and i talked about this a little bit.|s
me013|there was an issue of uh|s.%--
me013|suppose we get in the uh|s.%--
me013|i guess it's enviable position although maybe it's just saying where the weak link is in the chain.|s^rt
me013|uh where we we|s.%--
me013|uh uh|fh
me013|we have all the data transcribed.|s
me013|and we have these transcribers.|s^rt
me013|and we were we're the|s.%--
me013|we're still a bit slow on feeding|s.%--
me013|at that point we've caught up.|s
me013|and the the the uh the weak link is is recording meetings.|s
me013|okay.|s^f
me013|um|h
me013|two questions come is you know what how how do we|qw.%--
me013|uh it's not really a problem at the moment because we haven't reached that point.|s
me013|but how do we step out the recorded meetings?|qw
me013|and the other one is um uh is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things?|qy
me013|so um i i can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting.|s
me011|we had spoken with them about it.|s
me013|but there was|s.%-
fe008|and there is one use that that also we discussed which was when uh dave finishes the|s.%--
fe008|and maybe it's already finished.|s^df
fe008|the the modification to multi trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps.|s
fe008|uh then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps.|s
fe008|it's just a matter of you know providing|s.%--
fe008|so if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time interval|s.%--
fe008|bin well with with the improvement in the database in in the uh sorry in the interface it'd be possible to um you know just do a click and drag thing and get the uh the specific place of each of those the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment.|s
me013|right so i think we talking about three level three things.|fg|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|one one was uh we had had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings.|s
fe008|the types of overlaps|s^2.%-
me013|types of overlaps and so forth that that someone could do.|s^bk^m
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|second was uh somewhat lower level.|s
me013|just doing these more precise timings.|s
me013|and the third one is is uh just a completely wild hair brained idea that i have.|s
me013|which is that um if uh if we have time and people are able to do it to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech.|s
me013|for instance uh marking in some overlapping|s.%--
me013|potentially overlapping fashion uh the value of uh articulatory features.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|you know just sort of say okay it's voiced from here to here.|s^rt
me013|there's it's nasal from here to here and so forth.|s
me013|um as opposed to doing phonetic uh you know phonemic and the phonetic analysis.|fh|s
me011|uhhuh.|b.%
me013|and uh assuming uh articulatory feature values for those those things.|s
me013|um obviously that's extremely time consuming.|fh|s^bd^df
me013|uh|fh
me018|that would be really valuable i think.|s
me013|but uh|fh
me013|we could do it on some small subset.|s^cs
fe008|also if you're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels.|s
fe008|wouldn't it?|qy^g^rt
fe008|i mean i would think that that uh being able to code that there's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was.|s^e
me011|which one?|qw
fe016|huh.|b
fe008|i think vowels vowels are i think harder.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|well yeah.|s^am
me013|but i think also it's just the issue that that when you look at the when you look at switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone.|s^arp^ng
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|uhhuh okay.|s^bk
me011|yeah but but just saying what the|fg|s.%-
me013|at that point.|s
me013|because it's you know there's this movement from here to here.|s^df
fe008|yeah i'm sure.|s^na
fe008|uh yeah i i know.|s^bk
fe016|right.|b
me013|and and and it's|s.%-
me018|you're saying sort of remove the high level constraints.|s^bu
me013|so|%-
me018|and go bottom up.|s^bu^e
me011|yep just features.|s^aa|s^na
me018|then just say|s.%-
me013|yeah describe describe it.|s^aa|s^cs
fe016|huh.|b
me013|now i'm suggesting articulatory features.|s
me013|maybe there's there's even a better way to do it.|s
me013|but it but but that's you know sort of a traditional way of describing these things.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|um and uh|fh
fe008|that's nice.|s^ba
me013|i mean actually this might be a neat thing to talk to|s.%-
me018|acoustic features versus psychological categories.|s
me013|sort of.|s^aap
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|i mean it's still|s.%--
me018|yeah.|b
me013|some sort of categories.|s
me013|but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things.|s^cs
me013|and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes different timing changes as opposed to just click.|s^ba:s^fe
me013|you're now in this state which corresponds to this speech sound and so on.|s
me018|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
fe016|so this is like gestural uh these|s^bu.%--
me013|yeah something like that.|s^na
fe016|right.|b
me013|i mean actually if we get into that it might be good to uh uh haul john ohala into this.|s^cs
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|and ask his his views on it i think.|s^cs
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|right.|fg
fe016|but is is the goal there to have this on meeting data|qy^rt.%--
fe008|excellent.|b
fe016|like|%--
fe016|so that you can do far field studies of those gestures?|qy^bu^rt
fe016|or um|fh
fe016|or is it because you think there's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use?|qrr^rt
me013|no i think i think it's for for for that purpose i'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally.|s
fe016|or|qrr.%--
me013|and then you have and then and then it's natural in all senses.|s
me018|just a source of data?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|i see.|s^bk
me013|in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know one might have.|s
me013|and you have the close mikes.|s
me013|and you have people talking naturally.|s
me013|and the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|so so i think that given that it's that kind of corpus|s.%--
fe016|right.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|if it's going to be a very useful corpus|s.%--
me013|um if you say okay we've limited the use by some of our uh uh censored choices.|s:s
me013|we don't have the video we don't and so forth.|s
me013|but there's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices.|s^df
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|and uh most of the things we've talked about have been fairly high level.|s
me013|and being kind of a bottom up person i thought maybe we'd do some of the others.|s
me011|huh.|b
fe008|it's a nice balance.|s^ba
fe016|right yeah that would be good.|fg|s^ba
fe008|that would be really nice to offer those things with that wide range.|s^ba
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|and hopefully someone would make use of it.|s
fe008|really nice.|s^ba^r
me013|i mean people didn't|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|uh i mean people have made a lot of use of of timit.|s
me013|and uh due to its markings.|s
me013|and then the switchboard transcription thing.|s
me013|well i think has been very useful for a lot of people.|s^df
me011|right.|b
fe016|that's true.|s^ba
me013|so|fh
fe016|i guess i wanted to um sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings.|s^rt^tc
fe008|cool.|b
fe016|um|fh
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|actually i talked to chuck fillmore.|s
fe016|and i think they've what vehemently said no before.|s^rt
fe016|but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know well liz come to the meeting tomorrow.|s:s^co
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|and try to convince people.|s
fe016|so i'm going to try go to their meeting tomorrow.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and see if we can try uh to convince them.|s
fe008|good.|b
me013|because they have something like three or four different meetings.|s^bu
fe016|because they have|s.%-
fe016|and they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|talk|s^2.%-
fe016|and definitely than the front end meeting probably.|s
fe016|um|fh
me018|you mean in terms of the topic topics?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|well yes and in terms of the the fact that they're describing abstract things.|s^aap|s^rt
fe016|and uh just dialogue wise.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right.|s^f
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|um so i'll try.|s^rt
fe016|and then the other thing is|s.%--
fe016|i don't know if this is at all useful.|s^bd
fe016|but i asked lila if i can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building.|s^rt
me013|yes.|b
fe016|to see if there's any groups that for a free lunch|s.%--
fe016|if we can still offer that.|s
me011|you mean non icsi?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|great.|s^ba
fe016|might be willing|s.%-
fe016|non icsi non academic.|s^m^na
me011|yeah i guess you you can try.|s^am
fe016|you know like government people.|s^rt
me011|but|%-
fe016|i don't know.|s^bd
me011|the problem is so much of their stuff is confidential.|s^df
fe016|so|fh
me011|it would be very hard for them.|s^ng
fe008|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|also it does seem like it takes us way out of the demographic.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|is is it in these departments?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|i mean it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches.|s
me011|well i think that's her point.|s^df
fe016|right and then we could also we might try advertising again.|fg|s^cs
fe008|and that's a nice idea.|s^ba
fe016|because i think it'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non internal types of meetings.|s^df
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|and just also more data.|s^e
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|and i think uh if we could get|s.%-
me018|does does john ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings?|qy^rt
fe016|so|fh
fe016|so i actually wrote to him and he answered great that sounds really interesting.|s
fe016|but i never heard back.|s
fe016|because we didn't actually advertise openly.|s
fe016|we i mean|s.%--
fe016|i told i asked him privately.|s
fe016|um and it is a little bit of a trek for campus folks.|s
me011|yeah.|b
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|you might give them a free lunch.|s
me011|but um|fg
fe016|um so it's still worthwhile|fh|s.%-
me011|it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording.|s^cs
fe016|so|fg
me011|so i didn't have to do it each time.|s
fe016|exactly.|s^aa
fe008|yeah that's right.|b
fe016|and and|%-
fe016|and i was thinking|s.%-
me013|he's supposed he's supposed to be trained to do it.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa^rt
fe016|plus we could also get you know a a student.|s^cs^rt
me011|okay next week you're going to do it all.|s^bk|s^co^j
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|and i'm willing to try to learn.|s^cs^rt
fe016|i mean i'm i would do my best.|s^bd
fe016|um the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that um transcribers can do like dialogue act tagging.|s
me011|it's not that hard.|s^ba^na
fe016|disfluency tagging.|s
fe016|um things that are in the speech that are actually something we're working on for language modeling.|s
fe016|and mari's also interested in it.|s
fe016|andreas as well.|s
fe016|so if you want to process a utterance and the first thing they say is well and that well is coded as some kind of interrupt tag.|s
fe016|uh and things like that.|s
fe016|um|fh
fe008|of course some of that can be done lexically.|s
fe008|and i also they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already.|s
fe016|a lot of it can be done|s.%-
fe016|great so a a lot of this kind of|s^ba|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|i think there's a second pass.|s
fe016|and i don't really know what would exist in it.|s
fe016|but there's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of you know is it a question or not.|s^cs
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|or|%--
fe016|um that maybe these transcribers could do.|s^cs
fe016|so|fh
fe008|they'd be really good.|s^ba
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|they're they're very they're very consistent.|s^ba
me013|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe008|uh i wanted to while we're uh so to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data.|s^t^tc
fe016|that'd be great.|s^ba
fe008|um i have two questions.|fh|s
fe008|one of them is um jerry feldman's group.|s
fe008|they they uh are they|qy.%--
fe008|i know that they recorded one meeting.|s
fe008|are they willing?|qy
me013|i think they're open to it.|s
me013|i think you know all these things are|s.%--
fe016|oh yeah.|s^bk
me013|i think there's|s.%--
me013|we should go beyond uh icsi.|s
me013|but i mean there's a lot of stuff happening at icsi that we're not getting now that we could.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|so it's just|s.%--
fe016|oh that we could.|s^bk|s^bk^m
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah so the|s^aa|%-
fe016|i thought that all these people had sort of said no twice already.|s^df
me013|no no no.|s^ar
fe016|if that's not the case then|s.%-
me013|so there was the thing in fillmore's group.|s
me013|but even there he hadn't|s.%--
me013|what he'd said no to was for the main meeting.|s
me013|but they have several smaller meetings a week.|s
me011|so|fg.%
me013|and uh the notion was raised before that that could happen.|s
me013|and it just you know it just didn't come together.|s
fe016|just|%-
me018|well and and the other thing too is when they originally said no they didn't know about this post editing capability thing.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|but|%-
fe008|oh.|b
fe016|right.|s^bk
me013|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe016|right that was a big fear.|fg|s
fe008|that's important.|s
me018|so|fh
me013|yeah so i mean there's possibilities there.|fg|s^rt
me013|i think jerry's group yes.|s
me013|uh there's there's uh the networks group.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk^rt
me013|uh i don't know.|s^bd
me013|do they still meeting regularly?|qy^rt
me013|or|qrr.%--
me011|well i don't know if they meet regularly or not.|s
me011|but they are no longer recording.|s
me013|but i mean have they said they don't want to anymore?|qy^rt
me013|or|qrr.%--
me011|um ugh what was his name?|h|qw^t1
me013|uh|%-
fe008|joe sokol?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
me011|when with him gone it sort of trickled off.|s
me011|they and they stopped.|s
me013|okay so they're down to three or four people.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me013|but the thing is three or four people is okay.|s^df
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me011|yep.|b
fe008|we might be able to get the administration|s^cs.%-
me011|well he was sort of my contact.|s
me011|so i just need to find out who's running it now.|s
me011|so|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe008|i see that lila has a luncheon meeting in here periodically.|s
fe008|i don't know|s.%--
fe016|yeah i mean it one thing that would be nice.|fg|s^cs
fe016|and this it sounds bizarre.|s^bd^df
fe016|but i'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there's a little bit of heated discussion.|s^cs
fe016|like arguments and or emotion and things like that.|s^e^rt
fe016|and so i was thinking if there's any like berkeley political groups or something.|s
fe016|i mean that'd be perfect.|s^ba
fe016|some group yes we must.|s:s
me011|who's willing to get recorded and distributed?|qy^d^rt
fe016|well you know something|s^nd.%-
me001|yeah i don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to|s^nd.%-
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|um|fh
me013|yeah.|fg
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me013|with with with potential use from the defense department.|s^j
fe016|well okay|fg
me011|yeah.|b
me001|yeah exactly.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|no but maybe student uh groups or um film makers or something a little bit colorful.|s^cs^nd
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|fg
fe008|of course there is this problem though that if we give them the chance to excise later we might end up with like five minutes out of a of one hour|s.%--
mn005|film maker.|s^m
me011|of beeps.|s^2^j
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|is|%-
fe008|yes really.|s^aa
fe016|and i don't mean that they're angry.|s
fe016|but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat.|s^ba^cs
fe016|so if anyone has ideas.|s
fe016|i'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people.|s^cc
fe016|but i don't really know which groups are worth pursuing.|s
fe008|well there was this k p f a idea.|s
me011|no that's|s^ar|%-
me013|yeah there's a problem there in terms of uh the um commercial value of of uh|s^ng.%-
fe008|but|fh
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me011|legal.|s^2
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|it it it it turned out to be a bit of a problem.|s
fe016|or|fg
fe008|and i had one other one other aspect of this.|s^t
fe008|which is um uh uh jonathan fiscus expressed uh a major interest in having meetings which were all english speakers.|s
fe008|now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|but that's what he wanted me to show him.|s
fe008|so i'm giving him our um our initial meeting.|s^cc
fe008|because he asked for all english.|s^df
fe008|and i think we don't have a lot of all english meetings right now.|s^df^e
me018|did he mean uh did he mean and non british?|qy^bu^rt
me013|of all all all native speakers.|s^2
me011|well|fg
mn014|the all native.|s^na
fe008|that's what i mean yeah.|s^na
me011|well if he meant and non british i think we have zero.|s^j
fe008|he doesn't care.|s^na
fe008|no uh well british is okay.|s^e
fe008|but but|fh
me018|he said british was okay?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|sure sure sure.|s^aa
me011|british is english?|qy^d^j^rt
me013|why?|qw^rt
fe008|different varieties of english.|s^na
mn014|oh!|s^fe
mn014|ooo ooo!|s^fe
me013|well i don't i don't i don't think if he didn't say that|s^nd.%-
fe008|native speaking native speaking english.|s
me011|i bet he meant native speaking american.|s^bc
fe008|yes.|s^aa
me013|i bet he did.|s^na
mn014|american english?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|oh really?|qh
me011|so why would he care?|qw
me018|knowing the application|s.%-
me013|i remember i remember a study|s.%-
fe016|that's|%-
fe016|i was thinking knowing the uh national institute of standards it is all|s.%-
me013|i remember a study that b b n did where they trained on|s.%--
me013|this was in wall street journal days or something.|s
me013|they trained on american english.|s^e
me013|and then they tested on uh different native speakers from different areas.|s^e
me013|and uh|fh
me013|uh the worst match was people whose native tongue was mandarin chinese.|fh|s
me013|the second worst was british english.|s
fe008|that's funny.|s^ba
me013|so it's you know|%--
fe008|all right.|s^bk
fe008|and so that would make sense.|s
me013|the the the german was much better.|s
fe008|i didn't have the context of that.|s
mn014|ooo ooo.|s
me013|it was swiss|s^j.%--
me013|yeah so it's|s.%--
me013|so i think you know if he's if he's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology i i i think he would probably want uh american english.|s
me011|i wonder if we have any.|s
fe008|all america okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|it it yeah unless we're going to train with a whole bunch of|s.%-
fe008|i think that the feldman's meetings tend to be more that way.|s
fe008|aren't they?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|i mean i sort of feel like they have|s^e.%--
me011|maybe.|s^am
me013|i think so.|s^am
me011|maybe.|s^am
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^am
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa^r
mn005|huh|b
me011|and maybe there are a few of with us where it was|s.%--
me011|you know dan wasn't there.|s^e
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and before jose started coming.|s^e
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me011|and|fh
me013|it's pretty tough uh this group yeah.|s
me011|yeah.|b
mn014|huh|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so uh what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor?|fh|qw^cs
me013|i mean film making or something like that.|s^e
fe016|exactly that's what i was|s^aa|s.%--
me013|you'd think like they would be|s.%-
mn005|a film maker.|s^2
fe016|something where there there is actually discussion where there's no right or wrong answer but but it's a matter of opinion kind of thing.|s^cs^rt
fe008|it's be fun.|s^ba.%
fe016|uh anyway if you if you have ideas.|fh|s^t
me011|rasta p l p.|s^j
me011|rasta p l p.|s^j^r
me001|we can just we can just have a political discussion one day.|s^cs
mn005|yes.|s^aa
me018|any department that calls itself science ring|s.%-
fe016|yeah we could|s^aa|s^cs.%-
mn005|department.|s^m
me001|uh i could make that pretty|s^cs^j.%-
me011|well like computer science.|s
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
me011|that|%-
mn005|computer|%--
fe008|we could get julia child.|s^cs^j
fe008|i know.|s^bk^j
me011|that's|%-
fe016|i'm i'm actually serious.|s
me011|got a ticket.|s^j.%
fe016|because uh you know we have the set up here.|s^df
me013|yeah i know you are.|s^bk
fe016|and and that that has a chance to give us some very interesting fun data.|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|if anyone has ideas.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|if you know any groups that are you know|s.%--
me011|well i had asked some some of the students at the business school.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me001|i know.|s
fe016|student groups like clubs things like that.|s
me011|i could|s^cc.%-
me013|put a little ad up saying come here and argue.|s^cs^j:s^co^j
fe016|not not|%-
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|the business school|s.%-
fe016|if you're really angry at someone use our conference room.|s^cs^j:s
me011|uh the business school might be good.|s^cs^r
me011|i actually spoke with some students up there.|s
fe016|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech.|s^e
fe016|really?|qh
me011|but when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff.|s
me011|so|fh
mn005|huh|b
me001|i|%-
me013|they could have a discussion about|s.%-
fe016|or people who are really|s^2.%-
me011|we should probably bleep that out.|s^cs
me013|about about tax cuts or something.|s
me001|i heard that at cal tech they have a special room|s.%--
me001|someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out.|s
me001|that you can go to and like throw things and break things.|s
me001|so we can like post a|s^cs.%-
me013|yeah now that is not actually what we|s^nd.%-
me011|that's not what we want.|s^nd
me001|no not to that extent.|s^aap
me001|but um|fh
fe016|well far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall.|s^j^ng
me001|yeah.|s^aa^j
me013|yeah but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing.|s^nd
me011|that's right.|s^aa^j
fe016|oh yeah right.|s^aa
me001|yeah.|b
mn005|the|%-
mn005|yeah|fg
me011|please throw everything in that direction.|s^j:s^co
mn005|but|fg
me013|yeah anyway.|b
me011|padded cell.|s
fe008|it'd be fun to get like a a visit from the|s.%-
me011|there was a dorm room at tech that uh someone had coated the walls and the ceiling and uh the floor with mattresses.|s
me001|huh|b
me011|the entire room.|s^e
me013|i had as my fourth thing here processing of wave forms.|s^t^tc:s
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|what did we mean by that?|qw^rt^t
me011|uh liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre processing.|h|s
me013|remember?|qy^d^rt
fe008|pre processing.|s
fe016|well i think that that was just sort of|s.%--
fe016|i already asked thilo.|s
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|you already did that.|s^m
fe016|but that um it would be helpful if i can stay in the loop somehow with um people who are doing any kind of post processing.|s^cs
fe016|whether it's to separate speakers or to improve the signal to noise ratio or both.|s^e
fe016|um that we can sort of try out as we're running recognition.|s^e
fe016|um so is that who else is|fh|s.%--
fe016|i guess dan ellis and you|s^bu.%-
mn014|dan.|s^aa^m
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
me011|yep.|s^aa
me013|yeah and dave uh gelbart again.|s^aa|s^2
fe016|and dave.|s^bk^m
mn014|yep.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|he's he's interested in in fact we're starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|which uh|%-
me011|i am not sure how much that's an issue with the close talking mikes.|s
me013|huh?|b^rt
me011|but who knows?|qh
me013|well let's isn't that what what you want|s.%-
fe016|i don't know.|s^no
fe016|i'm bad.|s
me013|no so no what you what you want when you're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better.|s^bu
fe016|it's like like|%-
me011|right.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|and the question is to to what extent is it getting hurt by uh by any room acoustics?|qw
me013|or is it just uh given that it's close it's not a problem?|qrr
me013|uh|fh
fe016|it doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear.|s
fe016|but i'm not an expert.|s^df
me013|okay so it's|s^bk|%-
fe016|it seems like a problem with cross talk.|s
me011|i bet with the lapel mike there's plenty uh room acoustic.|s^nd
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|but i think the rest is cross talk.|fh|s^aap
fe016|that that may be true.|s^na
fe016|but i don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods.|s^no
me011|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|that's true.|s^aa
me011|so i i think it's just|s.%--
me013|okay.|b
fe016|oh i don't know.|s^no
me011|yeah what you said cross talk.|s^na
fe016|all i meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we're also experimenting with different a s r uh techniques.|s^bs
me011|uhhuh.|b.%
fe016|and so it'd be good to know about it.|s^ba
me018|so the problem is like uh on the microphone of somebody who's not talking they're picking up signals from other people and that's causing problems?|qy^bu^rt
fe016|right although if they're not talking using the the inhouse transcriptions were sort of okay.|s^aa|s
fe016|because the no one transcribed any words there.|s^df
fe016|and we throw it out.|s
me018|uhhuh.|s^bk
fe016|but if they're talking at all and they're not talking the whole time|s.%--
fe016|so you get some speech and then a uhhuh and some more speech.|s:s
fe016|so that whole thing is one chunk.|s^e
fe016|and the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it.|s
fe016|that's where it's a big problem.|s
fe008|you know this does like seem like it would relate to some of what jose's been working on as well.|s
fe008|the encoding of the|s.%-
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|and and he also he was|s.%-
fe016|the energy.|s^2
mn005|yeah.|s^aa^r
fe016|right exactly.|s^aa
mn005|energy.|s^m
fe008|i was i was trying to remember you have this interface where you you you showed us one time on your laptop.|s
fe008|that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events.|s
mn005|yeah.|fg
mn005|yeah may i i only display the different colors for the different situation.|s
mn005|but uh for me and for my problems is uh is enough.|s
mn005|because uh it's possible uh uh in a sample view uh to nnn to compare with with the segment the the kind of assessment.|s^df
mn005|what happened with the the different parameters.|s
mn005|and only with a different bands of color for the uh few situation uh i consider for acoustic event is enough to to|fh|s.%--
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i i i see that uh you are considering now uh a very sophisticated uh um uh set of uh graphic uh uh um symbols to to transcribe.|s
mn005|no?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|oh i uhhuh|s.%-
mn005|because uh before you you are talking about the the possibility to include in the transcriber program uh um a set of symbols of graphic symbol to to mark the different situations during the transcription.|s^bu
mn005|during the transcription.|s^r
mn005|no?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|well you're saying so uh symbols for differences between laugh and sigh and and and slam the door and stuff?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|or some other kind of thing?|qrr
mn005|yeah yeah the the symbols you you talk of before.|s
mn005|no?|qy^d^g^rt
mn005|to to mark|s^e.%-
fe008|well i wouldn't say symbols so much.|s^nd
fe008|the the main change that i that i see in the interface is is just that we'll be able to more finely uh time things.|s
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|but i i also there was another aspect of your work that i was thinking about when i was talking to you.|s
fe008|which is that it sounded to me liz as though you|s.%--
fe016|huh|b
fe008|and uh maybe i didn't understand this.|s
fe008|but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together.|s^bu
fe008|and so if you have like a a you know speech from one speaker then you cut out the part that's not that speaker.|s^bu^e
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer.|s^bu^e
fe008|is that right?|qy^bu^g^rt
fe016|well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|because then we we're more guaranteed that the recognizer will|s^df.%--
fe016|for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries.|s
fe016|because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you're trying to align the more errors we have.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|um so you know that that it would help to have either pre processing of a signal that creates very good signal to noise ratio|fh|s.%--
fe008|because|%-
fe008|okay.|b
fe016|which i don't know how possible this is for the lapel.|s^no
fe016|um or to have very to have closer um time you know synch times basically around the speech.|fh|s
fe016|that gets transcribed in it or both.|s
fe016|and it's just sort of a open world right now of exploring that.|s
fe016|so i just wanted to see you know on the transcribing end from here things look good.|s^ba
fe016|uh the i b m one is more it's an open question right now.|fh|s
fe016|and then the issue of like global processing of some signal.|s
fe016|and then you know before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that.|s
me018|what about increasing the flexibility of the alignment?|qw^cs
fe008|okay.|b
me018|do you remember that thing that michael finka did?|qy^rt
me018|that experiment he did a while back?|qy^e^rt
fe016|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe016|right you can um|fg|s^cs.%--
fe016|uh|fh
fe016|the problem is just that the acoustic|s.%--
fe016|when the signal to noise ratio is too low um you you'll get uh an alignment with the wrong duration pattern.|s
me018|oh so that's the problem is the the signal to noise ratio.|s^bu
fe016|or it|%-
fe016|yeah it's not the fact that you have like|s^na.%--
fe016|i mean what he did is allow you to have uh words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|or even words inserted that weren't weren't there.|s^2
fe016|right things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong|s^aa|s.%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|because what they had done there is align and then chop.|s
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe016|um and this problem is a little bit more global.|fh|s
fe016|it's that there are problems even inside the alignments.|s^e
fe016|uh because of the fact that there's enough acoustic signal there for the recognizer to to eat as part of a word.|fh|s
fe016|and it tends to do that.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|so uh|fh
fe016|but we probably will have to do something like that in addition.|s
fe016|anyway so yeah bottom bottom line is just i wanted to make sure i can be aware of whoever's working on these signal processing techniques for uh detecting energies.|fh|s^bs
mn005|yeah.|b
fe016|because that that'll really help us.|s^df
me013|okay.|fg
me013|uh|fh
me013|tea has started out there i suggest we run through our digits.|s^cs
me013|and|fh
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|uh|%--
me013|so|fg
me013|okay we're done.|s^t
fe008|okay.|z
me001|test.|z
me013|let's see i should be|z
me011|as close to your mouth as you can get it.|z
me013|two.|z
me018|up high.|z
me018|high as you can get.|z
me013|la|z
mn005|channel one one one.|z
fe008|yeah on your upper lip.|z
me013|is this channel one?|z
me013|gee okay.|z
me013|yes.|z
me013|okay.|z
me011|okay so for for for people wearing the wireless mikes like like this one i find the easiest way to wear it is sort of this this sort of like that.|z
mn005|this is channel channel one one two three.|z
me001|channel five channel five.|z
me013|yeah.|z
me011|it's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples.|z
me013|uhhuh what do you do?|z
me001|test test test.|z
me011|so|z
me013|you do it higher?|z
me013|uhhuh.|z
me018|adam's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there.|z
fe008|yeah i think we're supposed to|z
fe008|that's right.|z
me011|and then also for for all of them if your boom is adjustable the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth.|z
me001|test test.|z
mn017|by the way there was a bug.|z
mn017|yeah it wasn't using the proper|z
me018|oh it was?|z
me011|and about uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth.|z
mn017|basically it wasn't adapting anything.|z
me018|oh.|z
me011|so about like i'm wearing it now.|z
me018|oh that's interesting.|z
me018|so why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?|z
mn005|it's not always possible.|z
me011|so jane you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth.|z
mn017|huh?|z
fe008|i could can this be like this?|z
me018|why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?|z
me011|but|z
mn017|oh because when it estimates the transformer produces like a single matrix or something.|z
me011|yep.|z
fe008|is that|z
fe008|okay thank you.|z
me001|adam i'm not|z
me001|uh looks kind of low on channel five.|z
me018|oh oh i see.|z
me018|i see i see.|z
me001|no?|z
me013|okay.|z
me011|channel five speak again.|z
fe008|hello.|z
me001|maybe not.|z
mn017|basically there were no counts.|z
me011|yeah that's all right.|z
me001|hello?|z
mn005|yeah.|z
me001|it's okay?|z
me011|i mean we could we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to.|z
me001|is this okay?|z
mn005|okay.|z
me018|i see what you mean.|z
fe016|who's channel b?|z
me011|but|z
me011|uh channel b is probably liz.|z
fe016|uh oh.|z
mn005|uh channel b i am channel b.|z
me013|you want to close this?|z
fe008|channel eight eight.|z
me013|or|z
fe016|no i|z
me011|thank you.|z
mn005|no channel b.|z
fe016|yeah.|z
mn017|hello hello?|z
fe016|yeah you're channel b.|z
mn005|yeah yeah.|z
fe016|so can you talk a bit?|z
fe016|i thought it might be too|z
mn005|okay yeah.|z
mn005|channel b one two three four five.|z
fe016|okay.|z
me011|yeah it's all right.|z
me011|so the gain isn't real good.|z
me013|we're recording.|s
fe016|okay.|z
me011|okay.|fg
me011|so we are recording.|fg|s^aa
mn005|uh.|%
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|yeah.|b
me001|oh.|s^bk
me011|um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are.|fh|s^t
mn017|okay.|b
me011|um we we're doing a new speaker form and you only have to fill out the speaker form once.|s^co
me011|but everyone does need to do it.|s^co
me011|and so that's the name sex email et cetera.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b.%
me011|we we had a lot of discussion about the variety of english and so on.|s
me011|so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank.|s^co
me011|um i i designed the form and i don't know what to put for my own region.|fh|s
me011|so|fh
mn017|huh.|b
me018|california.|s^cs
mn017|i think|s.%--
me011|california.|s^bk^m
mn005|california.|s^cs
mn017|um may i make one suggestion?|qy^cs
mn017|instead of age put date of uh year of birth.|s^cs
me011|sure.|s^aa
mn017|because age will change but the year of birth changes you know stays the same usually.|s^df
me011|oh.|s^bk
me011|birth year?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|actually wait a minute.|s^cs
fe008|although on|s.%-
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|shouldn't it be the other way around?|qy
me018|not for me.|s^j
fe008|course on the other on the other hand you could you view it as the age at the time of the|s^cs.%-
fe016|on the other side.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|well the thing is if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that|s^nd.%-
fe008|yes but what we care about is the age at at the recording date rather than the|fg|s^df^nd.%-
me018|but there's no other date on the form.|s^nd
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|we don't care how they old they really are.|s^j
mn017|well well i don't know.|s^nd
fe008|yes unless we want to send them a card.|s^aa|s^j
me011|well i guess it depends on how long the corpus is going to be collected for.|s
fe008|yeah that's true.|s^aa
mn017|anyway.|s^t1
fe016|i still don't see the problem.|s
me011|either way|%--
me011|yeah i think i think age is all right.|fh|s
me011|and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you'll be able to extract the date off that.|s
mn017|okay.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|%
me011|so anyway.|fh
me011|and so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time the speaker form only once the digit form every time.|s
me011|even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting.|s^co
me011|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|and then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form.|s^co
me011|and that should just be one person whose name i don't know.|s
me011|okay?|qy^d^f^g
me001|do you want this adam?|qy^rt
me011|uh sure.|h|s^aa
me011|thank you.|s^ft
me013|so uh|fg
me011|okay so should we do agenda items?|qy^cs^rt^t
me013|uh oh that's a good idea.|h|s^ba
me013|i shouldn't run the meeting.|s^cc
me011|uh well i have i want to talk about new microphones and wireless stuff.|s^t
fe008|huh.|b
me011|and i'm sure liz and andreas want to talk about recognition results.|s
me011|anything else?|qo^d^rt
fe016|i guess what time do we have to leave?|qw^rt^t3
fe016|three thirty?|qy^bu^d^rt^t3
mn017|yeah.|s^aa^t3
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|why don't you go first then.|s^co
fe016|so|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|good idea.|s^ba
mn017|okay.|%
fe016|um well i i sent out an email couple hours ago.|h|s
fe016|so|fh
fe016|um with andreas' help um andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer.|fh|s
fe016|which is uh gender dependent but like no adaptation no crossword models no trigrams.|s^e
fe016|a bigram recognizer.|s
fe016|and that's trained on switchboard which is telephone conversations.|s
fe016|um and thanks to don's help who|s.%--
fe016|don took the first meeting that jane had transcribed.|s
fe016|and um you know separated used the individual channels we segmented it into the segments that jane had used.|s
fe016|and uh don sampled that so so eight k.|s
fe016|um and then we ran up to i guess the first twenty minutes.|fh|s^rt
fe016|up to synch time of one two zero zero.|s
fe016|so is that that's twenty minutes or so?|qy^d^rt
fe016|um yeah because i guess there's some|fh|s.%--
me011|or so.|s^na
fe016|and don can talk to jane about this.|s^cs
fe016|there's some bug in the actual synch time file that uh uh|s.%--
fe016|i'm we're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier.|s
fe016|anyway so it's twenty minutes and i actually|s.%--
me011|huh.|b.%
fe016|um|fh
me011|i|%--
me011|was that did that did that recording have the glitch in the middle?|qy^rt
fe008|i'm puzzled by that.|s
fe008|i oh oh i see.|s
fe016|there's there's a|s.%--
fe008|oh there was a glitch somewhere.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|so that actually|s.%--
fe016|um|fh
me001|was it twenty minutes in?|qy^rt
fe008|i forgot about that.|s
fe016|if it was twenty minutes in then i don't know.|s^no
me001|i thought|s.%-
fe008|well i mean they|s.%--
mn017|well it was interesting.|s
fe008|but i was able to transcribe|s.%-
me011|i don't remember when it is.|s^no
mn017|suddenly the the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent.|s
mn017|but looking at the first sentences looked much better than that.|s
mn017|and then suddenly it turned very bad.|s
mn017|and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the|s.%-
me001|yeah that might be that might be that might be my fault.|fg|s
mn017|it was actually recognized.|s
me011|oh no!|s^fe
fe008|wow!|s^fe.%
mn017|so|fh
me001|i'm not|s.%-
me011|oh so that was just a parsing mismatch.|s
mn017|okay.|b
fe016|no actually it was|s^ar.%--
fe016|yeah it was a complicated bug.|fh|s
fe016|because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random.|s^df^rt
fe016|so|fh
fe008|oh.|b.%
me001|yeah i was pretty certain that it worked up until that time.|fg|s
fe008|that's not good.|%
fe016|um|fh
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me001|so|fh
fe016|so that's what we have.|s
mn017|okay.|b
me011|all right.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|but that that will be completely gone if this synch time problem.|s
me011|the the glitch.|s
mn017|so so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever up to that time to|s.%-
fe008|and the only glitch|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|yeah.|b.%
fe016|so you guys know.|s
me013|sorry i haven't seen the email.|s^fa
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|the|%
fe008|the the well wait.|%
fe016|so here's the actual copy of the email.|s
me013|what was the score?|qw
fe008|we should say something about the glitch.|s^cs
fe008|he he can say something about the glitch.|s^cs
fe016|um oh okay.|h|s^bk
me011|yeah.|b
fe008|because it's it's it's it's it's very small.|s^df
fe016|so does this glitch occur at other|qy.%-
me011|there there there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized.|s
fe008|very small.|s^r
fe008|yep.|b
fe016|oh.|s^bk
fe016|right.|s^bk
me011|so the that that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the s s h key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me001|huh.|b
me013|huh.|b
me011|and so the channels get a little asynchronous.|s
me011|and so if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing doing click sounds.|s
me013|so|fg
fe016|and is it only once that that happens?|qy^rt
me011|but|%-
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|it|%--
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|right once in the middle.|s^aa|s^na
fe016|there's the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong.|s
me013|so|fg
fe016|but|fh
me011|um but that shouldn't affect anything.|s
me013|so unsurprisingly adam is the golden voice.|fg|s^j
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|so that's actually|s.%-
fe008|and it|%
me013|you see this here?|qy^d^rt
me011|yeah yeah.|b
fe016|it it's|s.%-
me011|bah.|s^j
fe016|okay.|fg
fe016|no|fg
mn017|oh and|fg|%-
fe016|what happens is it actually affects the script that don|s.%-
me018|huh.|b
fe016|i mean if we know about it then i guess it could always be checked for it.|s
me011|well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything.|s
fe016|but they|%-
me001|yeah i don't know exactly what affected it.|s
fe008|i agree.|s^aa
fe008|i agree.|s^aa
me001|but i'll i'll talk to you about it.|s^cc
mn017|i i have|%-
me011|but i i do remember|s.%-
mn017|yeah.|b
me001|i'll show you the point.|s^cc
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|it it had no effect on my transcription.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe008|you know i mean i i had no trouble hearing it and and having time bins.|s
mn017|huh.|b
fe008|but there was a|s.%-
me011|i do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect x m l file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect.|s^r
fe008|oh.|s^bk
me001|that's what happened.|s^na
fe016|well the the synch time the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should.|s
fe008|oh.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me001|there was|%-
me011|where where they weren't monotonic.|s
me001|yeah i mean|fg|%-
fe016|right?|qy^d^f^g
fe016|there's things that are in smaller increments than a frame.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|oh interesting.|s^ba
me011|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|so that's|s.%-
me001|huh.|b
fe016|and so then i mean you look at that and it's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right.|s
fe008|oh.|s^bk
me011|yeah sounds like a bug.|fg|s^na
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|so anyway it's it's just|s.%--
fe016|that's why we only have twenty minutes.|s
fe016|but there's a significant amount of|s.%-
me001|non zero?|qy^2^d^rt
me001|um there are like more because there's a lot of zeros i tacked on just because of the way the script ran.|s
me011|the other one i saw was that it|s.%-
me001|i mean but there there was a point.|s
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|yeah that was fine.|s^na
me011|the other one i saw was non monotonic synch times.|s
fe016|that that was okay.|s^na
me001|okay.|%
me011|and that definitely indicates a bug.|s
me001|uh|fg
fe016|well that would really be a problem.|s
fe016|yeah.|fh
fe016|so anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting.|s
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|um and what's which|qw.%-
me011|so that's very encouraging.|s^ba
fe016|this is really encouraging because this is free recognition.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|huh.|b
me013|cool.|b
fe016|there's no i mean the language model for switchboard is totally different.|s
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|so you can see some like this trent lott which|s.%--
me018|trent lott.|s^j
fe016|um i mean|fh
fe016|these are sort of funny ones.|s
me018|it'll get those though.|s
fe016|there's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references.|s
fe016|i mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see.|s^cs
me011|i and as i said i would like to look at the lattices.|s^rt
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|but|fh
fe016|um it's pretty good.|s
me011|because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right.|s^df
fe016|well so i guess we can generate|s^cs.%-
me011|sounds likes|%-
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn017|there are a fair number of errors that are you know where got the plural s wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong.|s
fe016|um|fh
me011|yeah.|s^bk
me011|and who cares?|qh^nd
me011|and and there were lots of of course the uh uh in on of uh.|s
mn017|huh so if|%-
fe016|there's|%-
fe016|no those are actually|s^ar.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|a lot of the errors i think are out of vocabulary.|s
fe016|so is it like p z m is three words.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|it's p z m.|s^e
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|i mean there's nothing|s.%--
me011|right.|b
fe016|there's no language model for p z m or|s.%--
me011|right.|b
fe016|um|fh
me011|did you say there's no language for p z m?|qy^bu^rt
fe016|no language model i mean those|s^aa.%-
me011|do you mean so every time someone says p z m it's an error?|qy^rt
me011|maybe we shouldn't say p z m in these meetings.|s^cs^j
fe016|well well there's all kinds of other stuff like jimlet.|fg|s^df
fe016|and i mean um anyway there|fh|%--
me011|yeah that's right jimlet.|s^bk^j
me013|well we don't even know what that means.|s
fe016|so but this is really encouraging because|s.%--
me011|yeah that's right.|s^aa
me013|so i|%-
fe016|so i mean the bottom line is even though it's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of of reasonable you know switchboard.|s
fe016|this is like about how well we do on switchboard two data with the switchboard one trained mostly trained recognizer.|s
me011|right.|b
fe016|and switchboard two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic.|s
me011|excellent.|s^ba
fe016|and they're talking about things in the news that happened after switchboard one.|s
fe016|so there was so that's great.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah so we're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety three workshop.|s
fe016|um|fh
me013|and we were all getting like seventy percent error on switchboard.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|oh yeah.|s^bk
fe016|i mean this is really|s.%--
me013|you know|fh
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|and thanks to andreas who i mean this is a|s.%-
mn017|huh.|b
me011|well especially for the very first run i mean you|s^na.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|uh um|fh
mn017|oh it's the|s.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me011|the first run i ran of switchboard i got a hundred twenty percent word error.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|but|fh
fe016|so and what also this means is that|s.%--
fe008|right.|b
me011|not switchboard.|s^t3
fe016|um|fh
me011|uh broadcast news.|s^t3
mn017|well it's|s.%-
fe016|i mean there's a bunch of things in this note to various people.|s
fe016|especially i guess um with jane that that would help for|s.%--
fe016|since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring.|s
fe016|i had to deal with some of it by hand but i think a lot of it can be automated by|s.%-
me013|oh one thing i guess i didn't get|fg|s.%--
me013|so you know the language model was straight from from bigram from switchboard.|s^bs
me013|the acoustic models were also from switchboard or or|qr^bu^d^rt.%-
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|that's amazing.|s^ba
me013|so they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet?|qy^bu^d
me011|yeah so that's great.|s^ba
fe016|no.|s^aa
fe016|and actually we actually um used switchboard telephone bandwidth models.|fg|s^rt
fe008|that's amazing.|s^ba
me013|okay.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|which i guess|s^e.%-
me018|i was just going to say.|s^na
mn017|well that's those are the only ones there are.|s
me018|yeah.|fh
fe016|so that's the that's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of.|s
me011|yeah.|b
mn017|i mean|%
mn017|right.|b
fe016|and i guess ramana|s.%--
fe016|so a guy at s r i said that um there's not a huge amount of difference going from|s.%--
fe016|it's it's not like we probably lose a huge amount.|s
me013|right.|s^aa
fe016|but we won't know.|s^bd^no
fe016|because we don't have any full band models for conversational speech.|s^df
me018|it's probably not as bad as going using full band models on telephone band speech.|s
fe016|so|fh
mn017|oh yeah.|s^aa
me018|right?|qy^bu^d^g^rt
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|right so it's so|fg|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|but for broadcast news when we we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss.|s
me011|right it was not a big deal.|s^aa|s^ba^na
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|so i|s.%-
mn017|i should i should say that the language model is not just switchboard.|s
fe016|so that's good.|s^ba
me011|although combining them worked well.|s
mn017|it's also|s.%--
mn017|i mean there's uh actually more data is from broadcast news.|s
mn017|but with a little less weight.|s^e
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|like trent lott must have been from.|s^j
mn017|uh because|s^df.%-
fe016|i guess switchboard was before.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|um by the way just for fun we also ran|fg|s.%--
fe016|uh|fh
me013|good point.|s^ba
mn017|i mean our complete system starts by doing a gender detection.|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so just for the heck of it i ran that.|s
me011|and it said a hundred percent male?|qy^d^rt
mn017|um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right.|fh|s
fe016|the|%-
me011|oh it did?|qy^bh^d^rt
mn017|yeah so|fh
fe008|oh that's i'm glad.|s^ba
me011|it got all two genders?|qy^d^j
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|but you know jane and adam have you about equal performance.|fg|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|yes.|s^aa
fe016|and uh and that's interesting.|fh|s^ba
fe016|because i think the their language models are quite different.|s^df
fe016|so|fh
fe016|and i i'm pretty sure from listening to eric that you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he's so much worse is the lapel.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
fe008|that makes a lot of sense.|s^ba^na
me013|yeah.|fg
fe016|so it's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when when we get new microphones.|fh|s^cs
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|very possible.|b
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|i i i would bet on that too.|s^na
fe016|that would be worth it.|s
fe016|um|fh
me013|because he certainly in that when as a as a burp user he was he was a pretty uh strong one.|s^df
me011|sheep.|s^2
fe016|yeah.|fg
fe016|he he he sounded to me just from he sounded like a|s.%-
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|what's it a sheep or a goat?|qr
me011|a sheep.|s
me011|baah.|s
me013|sheep.|s
fe016|sheep.|s^bk^m
fe016|right.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|sheep is good.|s
fe016|sounded good.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|right so um so i guess the good news is that|fg|s^tc.%--
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we can do with the s r i system.|s
fe016|and we'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings.|s^cs
fe016|so this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no no tailoring at all.|s
mn017|i mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|because the|%-
me011|or just dictionary.|s^cs
fe016|the the vocabulary especially.|s
fe016|yeah.|fh
fe016|yeah so|fh
mn017|not that much the vocabulary actually.|s^arp
mn017|i think um well we have to see.|fh|s
mn017|but it's uh|fh
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|it's pretty good.|s
fe016|um so then|fh|s.%-
me013|have to add p z m and so on.|s^cs
me011|and i have to try it on the far field mike.|s
me013|but|fh
me011|yeah.|fh
fe016|p z m.|s
fe016|and then there's things like for the transcription i got when someone has a digit in the transcript i don't know if they said you know one one or eleven.|s
fe016|and i don't know if they said tcl or t c l.|s
fe016|there's things like that where you know the um we'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things.|s^cs
fe016|but in general it was really good.|s
fe016|and i'm hoping|s.%--
fe016|and this is this is good news.|s
fe016|because that means the force alignments should be good.|s^df
fe016|and if the force alignments|s.%--
fe016|i mean it's good news anyway.|s^bd
fe016|but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information.|s
fe016|for example about you know prosodic information.|s^e
fe016|and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times.|s^e
fe016|um so that'll be something that|fh|s.%--
fe016|actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place.|s^cs
fe016|because it's just going to give us time marks.|s
me011|well we've done that for one meeting.|s
me018|but you know|fg
fe016|so|b
fe016|for forced alignment.|s^aap
me011|uh oh oh.|h|s^bk
me011|not for words.|s^bu
fe016|right.|s^aa
me011|i'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not not for words.|s^bs^fa
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|so this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality?|qh
me011|right.|s^bk
fe016|and then i was thinking it|s.%-
me011|so we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription.|s^cs
me011|maybe actually mark the word boundaries.|s^cs
fe016|oh.|fg
fe016|or have someone look at the alignments.|s^cs
fe016|uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are okay and how far away they are.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|um but i think it's got to be pretty good.|fh|s
fe016|because otherwise the word recognition would be really crummy.|s^df
me011|right right.|b
fe016|it wouldn't necessarily be the other way around.|s
fe016|if the word recognition was crummy the alignment might be okay.|s^rt
fe016|but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good.|s
fe016|so that's about it.|fh|s
me018|i wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though.|s
me013|i|%-
me018|i mean if we're|%-
me011|that we're starting so well?|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|yeah if we're producing a data base that everybody's going to do well on|s^df.%-
me013|oh|b
me011|don't worry about it.|s^co^ng
me011|that's that's the close talking mikes.|s
me011|try it on the p z m's and and|s^co.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me013|which i would which well|%-
mn005|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|s^bk
me018|so the real value of the data base is these?|qy^d^rt
me011|yeah|s^aa.%--
me011|well no but|h|s^ar.%-
me013|i mean there's still just the the percentages.|s
me013|and i mean they're not|s.%--
fe016|this|%--
me013|as we've talked about before there's probably overlaps.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|this is not that good.|s
me013|there's probably overlaps in in uh in fair number in switchboard as well.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|but but there's other phenomena.|s
me013|it's a meeting.|s
me013|it's a different thing and there's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes.|s
me013|but uh|fh
me013|yeah certainly i'd like to see as soon as we could.|fh|s
me013|i mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way.|s^cs
me013|but soon as we could how well it does with say with the p z ms or maybe even one of the|s^cs.%--
fe016|right.|b
me013|and uh see if it's you know|s^cs.%--
me013|is it a hundred twenty percent?|qy
me013|or maybe it's not.|s
me013|maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty five percent or something.|s
me013|and and then if for the p z m it's seventy or something like that.|s
me013|that's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|no i think it's really|fg|s.%--
me013|so|fh
fe016|i mean this way we least have a baseline.|s
fe016|we know that for instance the transcripts are very good.|s
fe016|so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the the text.|s
fe016|um yeah they're pretty good.|fh|s
fe016|so and and it's converting automatically from the x m l to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth.|s
fe016|it's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in switchboard.|s
fe016|so that's good.|s
fe016|and um let's see.|fh|s^t1
fe016|there was one more thing i wanted to to mention.|s
fe016|i can't remember.|s^t1
fe016|um|fh
fe016|sorry can't remember.|s^fa
fe016|anyway it's|fh|%-
fe008|congratulations.|s^ba
fe008|is really great.|s^ba
fe016|well it was i mean i really didn't do this myself.|s^bd
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yeah it's really good.|s^ba
fe016|so andreas set up this recognizer and|s.%--
fe016|by the way the recognizer all the files i'm moving to s r i and running everything there.|s
fe016|so i brought back just these result files.|s^rt
fe016|and people can look at them.|s^cs
fe016|um so|fh
mn017|we we talked about setting up the s r i recognizer here.|s
mn017|that's you know if if there are more machines um uh here.|s
mn017|plus people can could run their own uh you know variants of of of the recognition runs.|s
mn017|um|fh
mn017|certainly doable.|s
mn017|um|fh
me013|yeah and|fg
me013|well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training.|s^aap
me013|yeah.|b
me013|seems reasonable.|s^aa
fe008|i need huh i need to ask one question.|s^cs
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
fe008|which is um so this issue of the uh legalistic aspects of the present you know pre adapted|s.%--
fe008|yeah well so what i mean is|s.%--
fe008|um|fh
fe008|the uh the data that you take into s r i first first question.|s
fe008|you're maintaining it in in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that that kind of stuff.|s^bu
fe008|right?|qy^d^g
mn017|um|h
fe016|from the outside world or|qr^bu^d.%--
fe008|by uh people uh who are not associated with this project.|s
me011|it's human subjects issues.|s
mn017|oh.|s^bk
me011|i told you about that.|s
fe008|exactly.|s^aa
fe016|um oh.|h
fe016|well okay.|h
fe016|we have no names.|s
fe016|although i um|%-
me011|that that's not the issue.|s^nd
me011|it's just the audio data itself.|s
fe016|audio data itself?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
me011|until people have a chance to edit it.|s
fe008|uhhuh exactly.|s^aa
fe016|uh so well i can i can protect my directories through there.|fg|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|great.|s^ba
fe016|right now they're not they're in the speech group directories which so i will|s.%--
fe016|i didn't know that actually.|s
me013|yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions.|fg|s^co
fe016|yeah okay.|b
me013|say it's okay.|s
fe008|yeah we had to get them to approve them.|s^na
fe016|right okay.|b
fe008|and then because because the other question i was going to ask is if we're having um you know it's|%--
fe008|but this this meeting that you have no problem.|s
fe008|because i i well i mean i i speak for myself.|s^df
me011|it's us.|s
fe008|but but i think that we didn't do anything that but|s.%--
fe008|well anyway so uh i wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that.|fh|s
fe008|although we should clear it with eric and dan of course.|s^cs
fe008|but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects.|s
fe016|that's true.|s^aa
fe008|and i don't know how that stands.|s
fe008|i mean if you if you get fantastic results and it's involving data which which later end up being lessened by you know certain elisions then i don't know.|s
fe008|but i wanted to raise that issue.|s
fe008|that's all.|s^tc
me013|well we|fg|%--
me013|i mean once we get all this streamlined it may be it|s.%--
me013|hopefully it will be fairly quick.|s
me013|but we get the transcriptions people approve them and so on.|s
me011|all right.|b
me013|it's just that we're|s.%-
me011|we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts.|s^co
fe008|great.|s^ba
mn017|huh.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|and get back any bleeps that they want.|s^co
fe016|yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue i thought.|fg|s^na
me013|it's going to be a rare thing that there's a bleep for the most part.|s
mn017|uh actually i had a question about the down sampling.|s^tc
mn017|um i don't know who i mean how this was done.|fh|s
mn017|but is is there are there any um issues with down sampling?|qy
fe016|don did this.|s
mn017|because i know that the recognizer um that we use can do it sort of on the fly.|s
mn017|um|fh
mn017|so we wouldn't have to have it uh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand.|s
mn017|and is there any um|qy.%--
mn017|are there other uh is there more than one way to do the down sampling where one might be better than another?|qy
me001|there are lots of there are lots of ways to do the down sampling um different filters to put on.|s^na
mn017|okay.|s^bk
mn017|right.|s^bk
me001|like anti aliasing stuff.|s^e
mn017|okay.|s^bk
mn017|so so the|fg|%-
me011|i don't think we even know which one.|s
me011|i assume you're using syn cat to do it?|qy^bu^d^rt
me001|no i'm using uh s n s n d uh are resample.|s^ar|s^ng
me011|or sound resample?|qrr^d
me011|resample.|s^2
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|yeah and dan's archaic acronyms.|s^j
me001|r s m p.|s
me001|yeah i don't really.|s
fe016|missing all the vowels.|s
me001|i just yeah i found it.|s
me011|not all of them.|s^arp
fe016|some of the vowels.|s^bsc^na
fe016|almost all the vowels.|s^aap^df
fe016|that's the hard part.|s
mn017|so so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms.|s^cs
me011|and a few of the consonants.|s^2
mn017|i mean segment them but not down sample them.|s^cs
fe016|yeah we could we could try that and and compare.|s
me001|yeah that's|%-
mn017|and and feed them to feed them to the s r i recognizer and see if if the s r i front end does something.|s^cs
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|i suspect that's sort of premature optimization.|s
me011|but|fh
me011|sure.|fh
fe016|we can try it.|s^cs
fe016|i i only down sampled them first because i was|s.%-
me001|i mean that's just one line that's one line of code to comment at.|s
mn017|well|fg
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|right and and it doesn't is no more work for um you know for us.|s^aa|s^na
me001|so|fh
me011|uhhuh.|b
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|well they're just bigger to transfer.|s
fe016|that's why i down sampled them before but|s.%-
mn017|well but they're only twice as big.|s^aap
mn017|so|fh
fe016|well i mean that was if it's the same then we can down sample here.|s^cs
mn017|i mean it's it's just a|%-
fe016|but if it's|%-
me001|although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories.|s^nd
me001|so|fh
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me001|but|fh
me001|no.|fh
me001|i mean it's not it wouldn't be a problem if you're interested in it.|s^cs^na
fe016|we could try that.|s^cs
me001|it would|%-
mn017|yeah i mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know|fg|s.%--
mn017|minus the transfer time it would it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and and and|s.%-
me001|yeah.|s^bk
me011|it's about a fifty minute drive?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|well it takes more disk space too.|s
mn017|and and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why.|s^cs
fe016|so i was just|%--
mn017|and you know what|fh|%-
me001|huh.|b
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
me001|in the front end we could do that.|s^cs
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so you just train just different filters?|qy^bu^d
me001|yeah i|fg
me013|and so you're just wondering whether the filter is|qy^bu^d.%-
me001|yeah i can imagine it would be.|fg|s
mn017|right.|s^aa
mn017|right.|s^aa
me001|i mean i guess there's some|s.%-
fe016|so we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there's any differences.|s^cs
mn017|you know at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance.|s
me001|huh.|b
mn017|so in other words|fh|s.%--
me013|right.|s^bk
mn017|right.|s^m
me011|it just seems to me that you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that.|s
mn017|so|fg
me011|i mean so one is a half a percent better than the other.|s
me011|i don't think that gives you any information.|s
fe016|well it's just as easy to to give you the sixteen k individual.|fg|s^nd
me011|yep.|s^bk
fe016|it was just more disk space you know for storing them.|s
me013|are you are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or p l p over there?|qr
fe016|so|fh
mn017|mel cepstrum.|s
me013|so probably doesn't matter.|s
fe016|well we could try.|s^cs
me001|there's there's your answer.|s^t3
me013|but but it wouldn't hurt to try.|s^cs
fe016|could easily try.|s
mn017|that's what i would assume but you never know.|s^no
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fh
mn017|you know?|qy^d
me013|sure.|s^bk
fe008|just uhhuh.|b
me013|no the reason i say this|fg|%--
me013|p l p uses uh auto regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you're doing.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not you wouldn't expect to be so much.|s
me013|but|fh
fe016|well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway.|s^cs
fe016|and just stick them somewhere.|s^cs
me001|yeah it's it's really not a problem.|s^na
fe016|and i'll rerun it with|s^cc.%-
mn017|actually no.|s^ar
mn017|don't stop.|s^co
me001|keep going.|s^j
mn017|don't stop at that part because we're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters.|s^co
me001|yeah.|b
mn017|so shouldn't use you should you know get|s^co.%-
me001|yeah i mean i'll i have to do is uh the reference file would stay the same.|fg|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|b.%
me001|it's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long.|s
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|right.|s^bk^r
me001|and i could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory.|s^cc
me001|that's not a problem.|s
me011|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|b
fe016|i mean i corrected all|fg|s.%--
fe016|i mean i hand edited the whole the whole meeting.|s
fe016|so that can be run.|s
fe016|it's just|%--
fe016|once we get the the bug out.|s
mn017|huh.|b
fe008|one one question which is i i had the impression from this from this meeting that that i transcribed that um that there was already automatic down sampling occurring.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe008|is that|qy.%--
fe008|i thought that in order to|s.%--
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe008|so it was so it's like there's already down|s.%-
me011|there's one level that's already happening right here.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|this is being recorded at forty eight kilohertz which is more that anybody needs.|s
me001|oh.|b
me011|right.|s^bk
me011|and it gets down sampled to sixteen.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe016|and that's actually said in your meeting.|s
me013|so|fh
me001|huh.|b
fe008|oh okay.|s^bk
fe016|that's how i know that.|s
fe008|that's exactly and that's how i know it.|s^na
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|i i it's like are we down sampling to sixteen?|qy^j
me013|it's a digital audio orientation for the board.|s
fe016|right.|s^bk
me013|it's in the monitor so it's|s.%--
mn017|huh.|b
fe016|thank god it's not more than that!|s^fe
me011|so|b.%
me001|is eight kilohertz is is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice?|qy
me013|yeah.|b.%
me011|and i have no idea what filter it's using.|s
me011|so|fh
me011|telephone.|s
me013|for telephone stuff.|s
me018|telephone.|s
me001|yeah that's what i was going to say.|s^na
me001|i mean like|s.%--
me001|so|fh
me013|so it's it's it's just that they were operating from switchboard which was a completely telephone data base.|s
me001|oh i see.|s^bk
me001|so|fh
me001|okay.|s^bk
me013|and so that was a standard for that sixteen|s.%-
me011|so sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing.|s
me001|right.|s^bk
me013|sixteen is more common for for uh broadband stuff that isn't|s.%--
me011|that isn't music.|s^2
me013|that isn't music and isn't telephone.|s
fe016|and i guess if you're comparing like uh if you want to run recognition on the p z m stuff you would want you don't want to down sample the that.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
me011|why is that?|qw^rt
fe016|right?|qy^d^g.%
me013|i don't know.|s^no
fe016|well i i mean if it's any better.|s
me013|no actually i would think that you would you would get better you'd get better high frequencies in the local mike.|s^nd
me011|all the way around i'd think.|s
me013|uh but who knows?|fh|qh
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|yeah.|b
me013|i mean we we we we we we want to find all this stuff out.|s
fe016|well we could try it.|s^cs
me013|we don't know.|s
me011|we're going to have plenty of low frequency on the p z m's with the fans.|s
fe016|okay.|fg
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|oh yeah.|fg
fe016|there was just one more thing i wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that|s^tc.%--
fe016|um|fh
fe016|well well it's sort of related.|s
fe016|but um|fh
fe016|good news also.|s
fe016|uh i got|fh|s.%--
fe016|well chuck fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings.|s
fe016|and that's too bad because they're very animated.|s
fe016|and but uh jerry also agreed so uh we're starting on on|s.%-
mn017|they're less animated.|s^j
fe016|well but he has fewer|fg|s.%--
fe016|he he won't have more than eight.|s
fe016|and it's a meeting on even deeper understanding e d u.|s
fe016|so that sounds interesting.|s
me011|dot e d u?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|as a compliment to our front end meeting.|s
fe016|and um so that's going to start monday.|fh|s
fe016|and one of the things that i was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose going to transcribe it.|s^cs
fe016|or or put a push a button or something when they want to make a note about oh boy you should probably erase those last few.|s^cs
fe016|or uh wait i want this not to be recorded now.|s^cs
fe016|or uh something like that|s^cs.%-
me013|weren't we going to do something with a pad at one point?|qy^rt
fe008|the cross pads?|qy^d^rt
me011|yeah we could do it with the cross pads.|s^na
fe016|because i was thinking you know if if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it's a group that we don't know|s.%--
fe016|um and this came up talking to to jerry also.|fh|s
fe016|that you know is there any way for them to indicate to make sure that the request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow?|qy
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so i don't know if anyone has ideas.|s
fe016|or you could even write down oh it's about three twenty five and|s^cs.%-
me013|well what i was just suggesting is is we have these this cross pad just for this purpose.|s^cs
me011|yeah and use that.|s^cs^na
me011|not a bad idea.|s^ba
me013|and just use that.|s^cs
fe016|that would be great.|s^ba
me013|and if we sink it in|s.%--
me013|the other thing is uh|s.%--
fe016|that be great.|s^ba^r
me013|i don't know if you know this or if it's a question for the mail to dan.|s
me013|but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board?|qr^rt
me011|i don't know.|s^no
me011|i don't know.|s^no^r
me011|i'll send mail to dan and ask.|s^cc
me011|i i think that it's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort.|s
me011|because it's one board with two digital channels.|s
me013|oh it is one board.|s^bk^m
me011|eight each.|s^e
me011|so it it takes two fibers in to the one board.|s
me011|and so i think if we want to do that more than that we'd have to have two boards.|s
me011|and then you have the synchronization issue.|s
me013|but that's a question because that would|s.%--
me013|if it was possible because it is|s.%--
me013|you know already we have a a a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
me013|and it's not just because we haven't been to the store.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|it's|%-
me018|what is the limit on each of those fiber channels?|qw
me018|is it the|qy.%-
me011|eight.|s
me018|it just it's eight channels come in?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|it's eight.|s.%
me018|does it have do with the sampling rate?|qy^rt
me011|i have no idea.|s^no
me011|but each each fiber channel has eight eight channels.|s
me011|and there are two two fibers that go in to the card.|s
me013|it might be a hard limitation.|s
me011|so|fh
me013|i mean one thing is it the whole thing as i said is is all structured in terms of forty eight kilohertz sampling.|s
me013|so that pushes requirements up a bit.|s
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me018|i was just wondering if if that could change.|s
me013|but|fh
me011|i mean then we'd also have to get another a d d and another mixer and all that sort of stuff.|s
me018|if we could drop that.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so i i'll send a mail to dan and ask him.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|b.%
me011|okay on the uh|qy^bu^t.%--
me011|are we done with that?|qy^rt^t
me011|so the topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes.|s^t^tc
me011|so i got a quote.|s
me011|um|fh
me011|we can fit we have room for one more wireless.|s
me011|and the wireless|s.%--
me011|this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars.|s
me011|it i didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner the receiver the other end.|s^co
me011|that's uh four thirty.|s
me011|um and then also|fh|s.%-
me018|wow!|s^fe
fe016|for for each?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|i mean the tuner is four thirty for each?|qy^bsc^bu^d^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe016|wow!|s^fe
me011|and we just need one more so so|s.%-
me013|yeah at least we got the good ones.|s
me011|yeah.|s^bk
me011|so that's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these.|s
me013|yeah.|b.%
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|um and then also um it turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of sony.|fh|s
me018|oh!|s^fe
me011|believe it or not.|s
me011|and sony only sells this headset.|s
fe008|huh.|b
me011|so if we want to use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and they apparently lots of people have done is sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end.|s
me011|and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself.|s
me011|and that's the other solution.|s
me011|and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece.|s
me011|and the he recommended um a crown c m three eleven a e headset for two hundred bucks apiece.|s
me013|there isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in?|qy^d^rt
me013|you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself?|qy^d^rt
me011|the reason is the only only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector.|s
me013|no i understand.|s^bk
me013|the reason i ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use.|s
me013|so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this.|s^cs
me011|oh i'm sure they would they would just charge us.|s^na
me018|well and they'd probably want quantity too.|s
me011|so|fh
me018|they'd|%
me013|well.|fg
me013|no they'll just charge us more.|s^ar|s^ng
me013|so it's this|%-
me018|huh.|b
me011|so so my question is should we go ahead and get nine identical head mounted crown mikes?|qy
me013|not before having one come here and have some people try it out.|s^arp^co
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|because there's no point in doing that if it's not going to be any better.|s
me011|so why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset?|qw^cs
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me011|and and see if that works.|s^cs
me013|and see if it's preferable and if it is then we'll get more.|s^2^cs
fe016|comfort.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|because i mean i think the microphones are okay.|s
fe016|it's just the the|s.%-
me011|right.|s^bk
me011|it's just they're not comfortable to wear.|s^2
me013|right.|b
fe016|could make our own handbands and|s^cs^j.%-
me011|um and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in l a.|fg|s
me011|and so it will take about a week to get here.|s
me013|yeah well it's|s.%--
me011|um so okay to just go order?|fh|qy^d^rt
me013|we're in this for the long term.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|just order it.|s^co^na
fe016|it's a lot of money for a handband.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|and who is the contact if i want to do an invoice?|qw
me001|yeah.|s^aa
me011|because i think that's how we did it before.|s
me013|uh we'll do this off line yeah.|h|s^co
me001|it's a long time to get from l a.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|and then nine channels is the maximum we can do.|s
me011|so|fh
me013|uh right.|fg|s^aa
me011|without getting more stuff.|s
me013|because|%--
me013|so one is for the daisy chain so that's fifteen instead of sixteen.|s
me013|and there's six on the table.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
me013|so that's nine.|s
fe016|can i ask a really dumb question?|qy^rt
me013|yeah.|%
me011|probably.|s^aa^j
fe016|is is there any way we can have you know like a a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they want to talk that|qy^cs.%-
fe016|i mean|fh
me013|that's a good idea.|s^ba^rt
me013|that's not a dumb question.|s
me013|it's a good idea.|s^ba^r
fe016|well i mean|s.%-
mn017|like uh like you know jerry springer thing.|s^j
me011|i'm just not sure how we would handle that in the|s^no.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me001|that's like the conch.|s^t3
fe016|well but|fg
me018|like at conferences?|qy^d^rt
fe016|well but there might be a way to say that there are going to be these different people.|s^df
mn017|you know|qy^d^g.%-
me001|see look.|%
me018|so nail the chairs down.|s^co^j
fe016|um and i don't know identifying somehow?|fh|qy^d^rt
mn017|yeah.|b
me011|yeah somehow.|s^nd
fe016|you know i was just thinking of jerry springer.|s
me011|it's not a bad idea.|s^aap
me013|no that no no.|fg
me013|that's a very|s.%--
me013|if we can't get another board and even if we can i have a feeling they'll be some work.|s
fe016|i mean for the few times that you might want to have that.|fg|s
me018|the springer mike.|s^j
me013|let's figure that we have eight which are set up.|s^cs
me013|and then there's a ninth which is passed around to|s^cs^e.%--
me011|a handheld.|s^2
me011|yeah.|b
me013|that's a good idea.|s^ba
me018|infinite expansion.|s
me013|right.|s^bk
me013|kind of rules out overlap.|s
me013|but but uh|fh
fe016|well or also for you know if people are not|fg|s.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me011|well we could just hand around the lapel.|s^cs
me013|uh no.|h|s^ar
me011|rather than get a|s.%--
me013|no that's|s^ar.%--
me011|do you want a handset?|qy^rt
fe016|no not the lapel.|s^ar|s^ng
me013|no.|s^ar
me011|well i mean is the is the handheld really any better?|fg|qy^df^rt
me018|liz hates the lapel.|s^j
me013|yes.|s^aa
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe016|i don't know.|s^no
fe016|but i i know the lapel is really suboptimal.|s
me013|no it|fg
me011|is awful?|qy^2^rt
me013|no it depends on the handheld.|fg|s
me013|but hand many hand helds are built with sort of uh anti shock sort of things so that it it is less uh susceptible to hand noises.|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|if you hold the lapel mike you just get all sorts of junk.|s
fe016|right.|b
me011|okay.|b
fe016|i mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of okay.|fg|s
me013|so|fh
me011|so i wonder if they have one that will hook up.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|they have|s.%-
me013|what?|qw^br^rt
me011|i wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we'll have to wire it ourselves.|s^r
me018|well you wouldn't want it to hook there.|s
me018|you'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room.|s
me018|right?|qy^bu^d^g^rt
me013|no that's uh|s^ar|s.%--
me013|you need a transmitter.|s
me011|what?|qw
me018|is isn't that built into the mike?|qy^rt
me013|oh i see.|s^bk
me013|get a get a different radio.|s^co
me013|yeah.|fh
fe016|yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless.|s^aa|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
me013|but you need a but it has to correspond to the receiver.|s
me018|have a little antenna coming out the bottom.|s^cs
me011|it's going to be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike.|s^cs^rt
me011|isn't it?|qy^bu^d^g^rt
me018|but then the mike has to|s^ng.%--
mn017|do you have to hand it around?|qy
mn017|and if you have two pieces of|s.%--
me001|yeah.|b
me013|no no.|fg
fe016|right.|b
me013|so right.|fg
me013|so this is a good point.|s^ba
me013|so yeah you have these these mikes with a little antenna on the end.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me011|and do you think you would be able to use the same receiver?|qy^rt
me013|i don't know.|s^no
me011|okay i'll i'll ask.|s^cc
me013|you'll have to check with them.|s^cs
me011|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|it's just a frequency.|s
me013|but that's that's a great idea.|s^ba
me013|and then just sort of have that as the and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever.|s^cs
me013|and and uh|fh
fe016|yeah because there's only i mean as andreas pointed out actually i think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other.|fg|s
mn017|pretty soon.|s
me018|huh yeah.|b
fe016|it just there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice.|s
fe016|and|fh
me013|right.|b
mn017|um got to go.|fg|s^tc
me013|off you go.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|fh
me011|okay.|fg
me011|so i guess people who have to leave can leave.|s
me011|and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits?|qr^rt^t
fe008|i i thought of some extra a couple of extra things i'd like to mention.|s^na
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe008|one of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far.|s
fe008|so um as of last night um i'd assigned twelve hours and they'd finished nine.|fh|s
me011|uh yep.|b.%
fe008|and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month.|s
fe008|i think that by tomorrow we'll have ten.|s
fe016|uh it's great.|s^ba
fe008|so they're still working.|s
me013|pretty close.|s^ba
me018|wow!|s^fe.%
fe016|i and this i got this email from jane at like two in the morning or something.|s
me013|that's good.|s^ba
me011|that's good.|s^ba
fe016|so it's really great.|s^ba^r
fe008|it's working out thanks.|s|s^ft
fe016|it's really great.|s^ba^r
fe008|thanks.|s^ft
fe008|and then um also an idea for another meeting which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data.|s^cs^t
fe008|it's sort of a a little bit a little bit|s.%-
fe016|that's a great idea.|s^ba
me011|yep.|b
me013|super idea.|s^ba
me011|that'd be very interesting.|s^ba
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|that's a great idea because i'd like to have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things.|s^ba^r
me011|i'd love to hear what they have to say.|s^ba
fe008|yeah.|b
me018|so if we got them to talk about this meeting it would be a meta meta meeting.|s^cs^j
fe016|that's a great idea.|s^ba^r
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah exactly.|s^aa
fe008|i guess nested several layers.|s
me013|now you have eight transcribers and there's ten of us.|s
fe008|but|fh
me013|so how do we do this is the only thing?|qw^d
fe016|or just have them talk amongst themselves.|s^cs
me018|have them have their own meeting.|s^2^cs
fe008|well that's what i'm thinking.|s^aa
fe016|and have|%--
fe008|yeah.|fh
me013|oh.|s^bk
fe008|have them talk about the data and they and they've made observations to me.|s
fe016|that would be great.|s^ba
fe008|like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap in fact it does.|s
fe008|but there are other groups of similar size that have very little.|s
fe008|you know it's part of it's it's the norm of the group and all that.|s
fe008|and they have various observations that would be fun i think.|s
fe016|that's a great idea.|s^ba
me011|yeah i'd like to hear what they say.|s^ba
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|be great.|s^ba
fe008|okay.|b
me013|so maybe we could they could have a meeting more or less without us that to do this and we should record it.|s^cs
me013|and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and and could you know could tell us about it.|s^cs
fe008|yeah.|b.%
me011|give us a status.|s^2^cs
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|oh good.|s^ba
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|what what|qw.%-
me011|that would be weird.|s
fe016|it's they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break.|s
fe008|yeah that's right.|s^aa
fe016|and i think that's a good idea.|s
fe008|yeah exactly.|s^aa
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|get them involved.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|great.|b
fe016|um that's a great idea.|fh|s^ba
fe008|great.|b
me013|super.|s^bk
fe016|i'm really sorry i have to|s^fa.%--
fe016|no i have to go as well.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe008|and then i wanted to also um say something about the fiscus uh uh john john fiscus visit tomorrow.|s^rt^t
fe008|and which is to say that it'll be from nine to one.|s^rt
fe008|that i'm going to uh uh offer the organization allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes.|s^cc
fe008|but to be basically in three parts.|s
fe008|the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects.|s
fe008|um other things.|fh|s
fe008|and he'll be also presenting what nist is doing.|s
fe008|and and uh then uh|fh
fe008|number two would be sort of a the the transcription process.|s
fe008|so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the the multitrans interface.|s
fe008|which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments.|s^e
fe008|which uh dave gelbart's been doing.|s
fe008|and then um uh and of course the presegmentation thilo's been doing.|fh|s
fe008|and then um the third part would|fh|s.%--
fe008|and again he has some stuff that's relevant with respect to nist.|s
fe008|and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards.|s
fe008|so at nist he's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard i guess i would say.|s
fe008|and i want it.|s
fe008|you know|fh
fe008|yeah.|fh
fe008|see what they're doing and also present what what we've chosen as ours and and discuss that kind of thing.|s
fe008|and so but he's only here until until one.|s
fe008|and actually we're thinking of noon being uh lunch time.|s
fe008|so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon.|s
me013|okay.|fg
fe008|and everybody who wants to attend is welcome.|s^cs
fe008|so|fh
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|oh where you're going to meet?|fg|qw^rt
fe008|here mostly.|s
fe008|but i've also reserved the barco room um uh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration.|s^e
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|but the nine nine o'clock will be be in here?|qy^d^rt
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|s^aa
me013|yeah okay.|s^bk
me011|i assume we're not going to try to record it?|qy^d
fe008|oh i think that would be hard yeah.|s^na
me013|yeah i think just adds|s^aa.%-
me011|all right.|s^bk
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|um good.|b
fe008|thank you though.|s^ft
fe008|uhhuh.|b.%
me013|so maybe do digits and recess?|fg|qy^cs^d^t^tc
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me011|unless there's anything else?|qo^d^rt
fe008|yeah.|b
me018|do digital ones?|qy^bu^rt
me013|uh okay.|h|s^aa
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me011|uh should we make him wear andreas' mike or would that just be too confusing?|fg|qr^cs
me013|yeah.|b
me013|no i don't think it's confusing.|s^ar
me013|well it doesn't confuse me.|fh|s^df^j^rt
fe008|when we do this in the key in the key in the key it has to indicate that channel change.|s
me018|does it mess up the forms?|qy^rt
fe008|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me011|uh yeah i just don't know how we would do that.|h|s^no
me011|so|fh
fe008|well have a time mark.|s
me011|i mean other than free free form.|s
me018|the on switch is here on the on the top there.|s
fe008|yeah.|s^bk
me013|okay.|fg
me011|and just clip it to your collar.|s^co
me013|that's fine.|s
mn017|okay my name is uh espen eriksen.|fg|s^rt^tc
mn017|i'm a norwegian.|s^rt
mn017|um uh this is my second semester at berkeley.|fh|s
mn017|currently i'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in d s p.|s^rt
mn017|and um when i come back to norway i'm going to continue with the more of a research project work kind of work.|fh|s^rt
mn017|so this semester i'm starting up with a with a small project through uh dave gelbart which i'm taking a course with.|fh|s
mn017|i got in touch with him and he told me about this project.|s^rt
mn017|so with the help of uh dan ellis i'm going to do small project associated to this.|fh|s
mn017|what i'm going to try to do is uh use use echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk.|s^cc
mn017|to try to do something about that.|s
mn017|so currently i'm um i'm just reading up on echo cancellation.|s
mn017|looking into the theory behind that.|s
mn017|and then uh hopefully i get some results.|fh|s
mn017|so it it's a it's a project goes over the course of one semester.|s
me011|great.|b
mn017|so i'm just here today to introduce myself.|s
mn017|tell about|s.%--
mn017|i'll be i'll be working on this.|s
me011|and are you staying at berkeley?|qy^rt
me011|or is are you just here a semester?|qrr

mn017|yeah i'm in morgan's course.|s^aa|s^na
me013|so|b
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|good.|b
me018|welcome.|s^bk
fe008|then you then you go back to norway?|qy^bu^d
fe008|that's|%--
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me001|we were just talking about something like this yesterday.|s
me001|or|%--
me001|yeah yesterday with liz.|s
me001|about doing some of the echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps.|s
me001|so|fh
me001|cool.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me011|digits?|qy^d^rt^t
me013|let's do digits.|s^co^na
me013|okay.|z
me011|and stop.|z
me011|okay we're on.|z
me013|okay.|z
mn005|yes.|z
me011|and we seem to be working.|z
mn005|one two three four|z
me013|okay.|z
me011|we didn't crash we're not crashing anymore.|z
me011|and it really bothers me.|z
me018|i do.|z
me013|yeah.|z
mn005|no crashing.|z
me018|i crashed when i started this morning.|z
me011|you crashed crashed this morning?|z
mn005|yeah?|z
me011|i did not crash this morning.|z
me013|oh!|z
me013|well maybe it's just you know how many how many times you crash in a day.|z
me018|really?|z
me018|yeah.|z
me018|maybe yeah.|z
me013|first time first time in the day.|z
me013|you know.|z
me018|or maybe it's once you've done enough meetings it won't crash on you anymore.|z
mn014|yeah.|z
mn005|no.|z
fe008|yeah.|z
me018|it's a matter of experience.|z
mn014|yeah.|z
me013|yeah.|z
fe008|self learning yeah.|z
me013|that's that's great.|z
me018|yeah.|z
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|uh|fg
me013|do we have an agenda?|qy^t^tc
me013|liz liz and andreas can't can't uh can't come.|s
me011|i do.|s^na
me013|so they won't be here.|s
me011|i have agenda.|s^r
me018|did|%-
me011|and it's all me.|s
me011|because no one sent me anything else.|s^df
me018|did they send uh the messages to you about the meeting today?|qy^rt
me011|i have no idea.|s^no
me011|but i just got it a few minutes ago.|s^df
me018|oh.|s^bk
me018|oh.|s^bk
me011|right when you were in my office it arrived.|s^e
me018|okay because i checked my mail i didn't have anything.|s^bk|s
me011|so does anyone have any agenda items other than me?|qy
me011|i actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits.|s
me013|uh right so so i i was just going to talk briefly about the n s f i t r.|h|s^na
mn005|uhhuh yeah.|b
me011|oh great.|s^ba
me013|uh|h
me013|and then you have|s.%--
fe008|can|%-
me013|i mean i won't say much.|s^bd
me013|but uh but then uh you said want to talk about digits?|qy^bu^d
me011|i have a short thing about digits.|s^na
me011|and then uh i want to talk a little bit about naming conventions.|s
me011|although it's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it.|s^df
me011|so maybe just talk about it very briefly.|s^cs
me011|and take the details to the people who for whom it's relevant.|s^e
me013|right.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|i could always say something about transcription.|s^cs
fe008|i've been but but uh well|%--
me013|well if we yeah we shouldn't add things in just to add things in.|s^ng
me013|i'm actually pretty busy today.|s^df
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|so if we can we|s^cs.%--
fe008|yeah yeah yeah.|s^bk
me013|a short meeting would be fine.|s^cs
fe008|this does sound like we're doing fine.|s^na
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|that won't do.|s
me011|so the only thing i want to say about digits is we are pretty much done with the first test set.|s^t^tc
me011|there are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read.|s
me011|so i won't really know until i go through all the transcriber forms.|s
me011|and extract out pieces that are in error.|s
me011|so i uh two things.|s
me011|the first is what should we do about digits that were misread?|qw
me011|my opinion is um we should just throw them out completely.|s^cs
me011|and have them read again by someone else.|s^cs^e
me011|you know the grouping is completely random.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|so it it's perfectly fine to put a a group together again.|s
me011|of errors.|s^e
me011|and have them re read|s^cs.%--
me011|just to finish out the test set.|s
fe008|oh by throw them out completely?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|um the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said.|s^cs
me011|so those are those are the two options.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but there's often things where people do false starts.|s
me013|i know i've done it where i say say a|s^df.%-
me011|what the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction and they eventually did read the right string you extract the right string.|s
me018|oh you're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and didn't correct it.|s^bu
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|yeah and didn't notice.|s^aa|s^e
me018|uh!|s^bk^fe
mn014|yeah.|s^bk
me011|which happens in a few places.|s^e
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|well and and you're talking string wise.|fg|s
me011|so so|fg
fe008|you're not talking about the entire page.|s^bu
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
me011|correct.|s^aa
fe008|i get it.|s^bk
me011|and so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said.|s^rt
me011|but then but then the transcript isn't the aurora test set anymore.|s^df
me011|i don't think that really matters.|s
me011|because the conditions are so different.|s^df
me011|and that would be a little easier.|s^ba
me018|well how many are how how often does that happen?|qw
me011|huh five or six times.|s^rt
me018|oh so it's not very much.|s^bk|s^ba
me011|no it's not much at all.|s^aa|s^na
me018|seems like we should just change the transcripts.|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
me011|okay.|s^bk
me018|to match.|s^e
me013|yeah it's five or six times out of thousands?|fg|qy^bu^d^rt
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|four thousand.|s^bc
mn005|four uh four thousand.|s^bc
me013|four thousand?|qh^bk
me018|yeah.|b
me018|it's|%--
me013|yeah i would uh do the easy way.|fg|s^cs
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|it it's kind of nice|s^ba.%-
mn005|huh.|b
me013|i mean who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker dependent things?|qh
me013|and so i think having having it all|s^cs.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|the speakers who we had is is at least interesting.|s^ba
me018|so you um how many digits have been transcribed now?|fg|qw
me011|four thousand lines.|s
me011|and each line is between one and about ten digits.|s
me018|four thousand lines?|qh^bk^d
me011|i didn't i didn't compute the average.|s
me011|i think the average was around four or five.|s
me013|so that's a couple hours of of uh speech probably.|s
me018|wow.|s^ba
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|yep.|b
me013|which is a yeah reasonable reasonable test set.|s^ba
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|and jane i do have a set of forms which i think you have copies of somewhere.|s
fe008|uhhuh yeah true.|s^aa
me011|oh you do?|s^bk|qy^bu^d
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|s^aa
me011|oh okay good good.|s^bk|s^ba
me011|yeah i was just|s^df.%--
me011|i thought i had had all of them back from you.|s
fe008|no not yet.|s^ar|s^na
me011|and then the other thing is that uh the forms in front of us here that we're going to read later were suggested by liz.|s
me011|because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits.|s^df
mn005|uhhuh.|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|and so uh i just wanted people to take a quick look at the instructions.|s^co
mn014|eight eight two two two nine.|s.%
me011|and the way it worked and see if it makes sense.|s
me011|and if anyone has any comments on it.|s
me013|i see.|s^bk
me013|and the decision here uh was to continue with uh the words rather than the the numerics.|s^bu
me011|uh yes.|h|s^aa^rt
me011|although we could switch it back.|s^cs
me011|the problem was o and zero.|s
me011|although we could switch it back and tell them always to say zero or always to say o.|s^cs
fe008|oh.|s^bk.%
me013|or neither.|s^cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but it's just two thing ways that you can say it.|s^bu
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
fe008|oh.|b
me011|sure.|s^aa
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|um um|fh
me013|that's the only thought i have.|s
me013|because if you start talking about these you know|s^df.%--
me013|she's trying to get at natural groupings.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
me013|but it there's there's nothing natural about reading numbers this way.|s
me013|i mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way.|s^df^e
me011|the the problem also is she did want to stick with digits.|s
me011|i mean i'm speaking for her since she's not here.|s^df
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|but um the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals they might say forty three instead of four three.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|huh!|s^bk^fe
mn005|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|well if there's space though between them|s.%--
fe008|i mean you can|s.%--
fe008|with when you space them out they don't look like uh forty three anymore.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|well she and i were talking about it.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and she felt that it's very very natural to do that sort of chunking.|s
me013|she's right it's it it's a different problem.|s^na|s^ba
me013|i mean it's a it's a it's an interesting problem.|s
me013|i mean we've done stuff with numbers before.|s
me013|and yeah sometimes people|s.%--
me013|if you say three nine eight one sometimes people will say thirty nine eighty one.|s
me013|or three hundred three hundred eighty nine one.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|or i don't think they'd say that.|s^bd
me013|but|fh
me011|not very frequently.|s^na
me013|but|%-
me013|no.|s^aa
me011|but they certainly could.|s^df
me013|but|%-
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|uh thirty eight ninety one is probably how they'd do it.|s
me011|so i mean this is something that liz and i spoke about.|fg|s
me013|but|fh
me011|and since this was something that liz asked for specifically i think we need to defer to her.|s^cs
me013|i see.|s^bk
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|okay well we're probably going to be collecting meetings for a while.|s^bk|s
me013|and if we decide we still want to do some digits later we might be able to do some different different versions.|s
me011|do something different.|s^2
me011|yeah.|b
me013|but this is the next suggestion.|s^bd
me013|so|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay so uh i guess let me uh get my my short thing out about the n s f.|fg|s^t^tc
me013|i sent this|s.%--
me013|actually this is maybe a little side thing.|s
me013|um i i sent to what i thought we had uh in some previous mail as the right joint thing to send to.|s
me011|it was.|s
me013|which was m m t g r c d r hyphen joint.|s
me011|joint.|s^2
me011|yep.|s^aa
me013|but then i got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to|s.%-
me011|it's|%-
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|that's because they set the one up at u w.|s
me011|that's not on our side that's on the u dub side.|s
me013|oh.|s^bk
me011|and so u u w set it up as a moderated list.|s
fe008|yeah.|b.%
me013|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|and i have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone.|s^no
me011|so you might just want to mail to mari.|s^cs
me013|no no i got i got uh little excited notes from mari and jeff and so on.|s^ar|s^df
me011|and|%-
me011|okay good.|s^bk|s^ba
me013|so it's|%--
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so the moderator actually did repost it.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|because i had sent one earlier.|s
me011|actually the same thing happened to me i had sent one earlier.|s
me011|the message says you'll be informed.|s:s
me011|and then i was never informed.|s
me011|but i got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it.|s
me011|so|fh
me013|right.|b
me011|it's just to prevent spam.|s
me013|i see.|s^bk
me013|yeah so o okay well anyway i guess everybody here are are.|fg|s^tc
me013|you are on that list.|s^bu
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|so you got the note.|s^bu
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah okay.|s^bk
me013|um|fh
me013|so this was uh a uh proposal that we put in.|s
me013|before on on more more higher level uh issues in meetings.|s^e
me013|from i guess higher level from my point of view.|s^bd
me013|and uh meeting mappings.|s
me013|and uh|fh
me013|so is for it was a proposal for the i t r program.|s
me013|uh information technology research program's part of national science foundation.|s
me013|it's the second year of their doing uh these grants.|s
me013|they're they're|%--
me013|a lot of them are|s.%--
me013|some of them anyway are larger larger grants than the usual small n s f grants.|s
me013|and|fh
me013|so they're very competitive.|s^ba
me013|and they have a first phase where you put in pre proposals.|s
me013|and we we uh got through that.|s
me013|and so the the next phase will be we'll actually be doing a larger proposal.|s
me013|and i'm i i hope to be doing very little of it.|s
me013|and|fh
me013|uh which was also true for the pre proposal.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|uh there'll be bunch of people working on it.|s
me013|so|fh
me011|when's when's the full proposal due?|qw^rt
me013|uh i think april ninth or something.|s
me013|so it's about a month.|s
me011|yep.|s^bk
me013|um|fh
me011|and they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms.|s^rt
me018|tomorrow.|s
me011|is that|qy.%-
me013|tomorrow.|s
mn014|tomorrow.|s
me013|march second i said.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn005|tomorrow.|s
me011|i've been a day off all week.|s
me011|i guess that's a good thing.|s^ba
me011|because that way i got my papers done early.|s^df
me018|it would be interesting|s.%-
me013|so that's amazing you showed up at this meeting!|s^ba^fe
me011|it is it is actually quite amazing.|s^na
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|it'll be interesting to see the reviewer's comments.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
me013|my favorite is was when when when one reviewer says uh you know this should be far more detailed.|s
me013|and the the next reviewer says you know there's way too much detail.|s
me011|yep.|b
me011|or this is way too general.|s
me011|and the other reviewer says this is way too specific.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|this is way too hard.|s
me011|way too easy.|s
me013|we'll see.|s
me013|maybe there'll be something useful.|s^am
me013|and and uh|%-
me011|well it sounded like they they the first gate was pretty easy.|s^bu^rt
me011|is that right?|qy^g^rt
me011|that they didn't reject a lot of the pre proposals.|s^e^rt
me013|do you know anything about the numbers?|qy^rt
me011|no.|s^ar
me018|it's just from his message it sounded like that.|s
me011|just just|%-
mn014|yeah yeah.|b
mn014|i said something yeah.|s
me018|gary strong's|%--
me018|there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs.|s
me018|i|%-
mn014|yeah.|b.%
me013|i should go back and look.|s
me013|i didn't i don't think that's true.|s
me011|yeah okay.|b
me018|huh.|b
me018|he said the next phase will be very competitive.|s
mn014|very very|s^2.%--
me018|because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|or something like that.|s
me013|well we'll have to see what the numbers are.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|so|fh
mn005|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|but they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|so uh you know maybe they didn't weed out as much as usual.|s
me013|but it's it's usually a pretty|s.%--
me013|but it|%--
me013|yeah it's it's certainly not i'm sure that it's not down to one in two or something.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|of what's left.|s^e
me013|i'm sure it's you know|s.%-
me011|how how many awards are there?|qw^rt
me011|do you know?|qy^e^rt
me013|well there's different numbers of awards for different size.|s
me013|they have three size grants.|s
me013|this one there's|s.%--
me013|um|fh
me013|see the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years.|s
me013|and that they have a fair number of them.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|and the large ones are|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|boy i forget.|s^no
me013|i think more than|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|more than a million and a half more than two million or something like that.|s
me013|and and we're in the middle|s.%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|middle category.|s^e
me013|i think we're|s.%--
me013|uh uh|fh
me013|i forget what it was.|s^no
me013|but um|fh
me013|uh i don't remember.|s^no
me013|but it's probably along the|s.%--
me013|i i could be wrong on this.|s^bd
me013|yeah but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they'll fund or twenty.|s
me013|i mean when they do you do you know how many they funded when they in in chuck's?|qy
me013|that he got last year.|s^e
me018|i don't i don't know.|s^no
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me011|i thought it was smaller.|s
me011|that it was like four or five.|s
me011|wasn't it?|qy
me018|i i'm|%--
me013|well they fund|s.%--
me018|i don't remember.|s^no
me013|they|%--
me013|yeah.|b
me011|uh it doesn't matter.|s^ba
me013|i mean|%-
me011|we'll find out one way or another.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
me013|i mean last time i think they just had two categories.|s
me013|small and big.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|and this time they came up with a middle one.|s
me013|so it'll there'll be more of them that they fund than of the big.|s
me018|if we end up getting this um what will it mean to icsi in terms of where will the money go to?|qo
me018|what would we be doing with it?|qw^e
me013|uh|fh
me011|exactly what we say in the proposal.|s
me018|i i mean uh which part is icsi though?|qw
me013|you know it|%-
me018|i mean|fh
me013|none of it will go for those yachts that we've talking about.|s^j
me018|dang!|s^ba^fe
me013|um well|fh
me013|no i mean it's|s.%-
me013|it|%-
me018|it's just for the research.|s^bu
me018|to continue the research on the meeting recorder stuff.|s^bu^rt
me013|it's extending the research.|s^aap
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me013|because the other|s^df.%-
me011|yeah it's higher level stuff than we've been talking about for meeting recorder.|fg|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah the other things that we have uh been working on with uh the with communicator.|fg|s
me013|uh especially with the newer things.|s
me013|with the more acoustically oriented things are are are are lower level.|s
me013|and|fh
me013|this is dealing with uh mapping on the level of of um the conversation.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|of mapping the conversations.|s^e
me018|right right.|b
me013|to different kind of planes.|s^e
me013|so um but um|fh
me013|so it's it's all stuff that none of us are doing right now.|s
me013|or none of us are funded for.|s
me013|so it's so it's it would be new.|s
me018|so assuming everybody's completely busy now it means we're going to have to hire more students or something?|qo^rt
me013|well there's evenings and there's weekends.|s^j
me013|and uh|fh
me013|yeah there there would be there would be new hires.|s^aa|s.x
me013|and and there there would be expansion.|s^e
me013|but|fh
me013|also there's always for everybody there's there's always things that are dropping off.|s
me013|grants that are ending.|s
me013|or other things that are ending.|s
me018|right.|b
me013|so|fh
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|there's there's a continual need to to bring in new things.|s
me018|right.|b
me011|yep.|b
me018|i see.|b.x
me013|but but there definitely would be new new new uh students.|s
me013|and so forth both at at u w and here.|s
me011|are there any students in your class who are expressing interest?|qy^rt
me013|um not clear yet.|h|s^no
me011|other than the one who's already here.|s^e
me013|not clear yet.|s^r
me013|i mean we got we have|s.%--
me013|yeah two of them are two in the there're two in the class already here.|s^rt
me013|and then|%--
me013|and and uh uh|fh
me013|then there's a third who's doing a project here.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|who uh but he he he won't be in the country that long.|s^bd
me013|and|fh
me013|maybe another will end up|s.%--
me011|yep.|b
me013|actually there is one other guy who's looking that that's that|s.%--
me013|guy uh|%--
me013|jeremy i think.|s^rt
mn005|huh.|b
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me013|anyway yeah that's that's all i was going to say is that that that's you know that's nice.|fg|s
me013|and we're sort of preceding to the next step.|s
me013|and it'll mean some more work uh you know in in march in getting the proposal out.|s
me013|and then it's uh you know we'll see what happens.|s
me013|uh the last one was that you had there was about naming?|qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|it just uh we've been cutting up sound files in for both digits and for uh doing recognition.|s
me011|and liz had some suggestions on naming.|s
me011|and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming.|s
me011|so uh one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length.|s
me011|so that sorting is easier.|s^df
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|um|fh
me011|same number of characters.|s^e
me011|so that when you're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want.|s^df
me011|and that's easy enough to do.|s^ba
me011|and i don't think we have so many meetings that that's a big deal just to change the names.|s
me011|so that means uh instead of calling it m r one m r two you'd call it m r m zero zero one.|s
me011|m r m zero zero two things like that.|s
me011|just so that they're they're all the same length.|s
fe008|but you know when you do things like that you can always|s.%--
fe008|as long as you have|s^df.%--
fe008|uh you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string.|s
fe008|you know so zero zero two|s.%-
me011|the problem is that they're a lot of fields.|s
fe008|yeah.|s^bk
me011|all right.|s^f
me011|so we we have we're going to have the speaker i d.|s^df^e
me011|the session.|s
me011|uh uh|fh
fe008|yeah well your example was really|s^bk|s^ba.%-
me011|information on the microphones.|s
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|information on the on the channels and all that.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me011|and so if each one of those is a fixed length the sorting becomes a lot easier.|s^ba
me001|she wanted to keep them the same lengths across different meetings also.|s^rt
me001|so like the n s a meeting lengths all filenames are going to be the same length as the meeting recorder meeting names?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|and as i said it's we just don't have that many that that's a big deal.|s^ba
me018|because of digits?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|and so uh um at some point we have to sort of take a few days off|s^cs.%--
me011|let the transcribers have a few days off.|s^cs^e
me011|make sure no one's touching the data.|s^cs^e
me011|and re organize the file structures.|s^cs^e
me011|and when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming.|s
fe008|i i would think though that the transcribe the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names.|s^ng
fe008|so i mean you're dealing with a different domain there and with start and end times and all that.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
fe008|and channels and stuff.|s
fe008|so it's a different set.|s
me011|right so the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names.|fg|s
me011|i would change them to match.|s
me011|so instead of being m r one it would be m r m zero zero one.|s
me011|but i don't think that's a big deal.|s^ba
fe008|fine .fine.|s^bk
me011|so for for the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers.|s
me011|for meeting i ds.|s
me011|uh for speakers m or f and then three numbers.|s
me011|for uh and uh|fh
me011|that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth.|s^cs
me011|and keep it consistent.|s
me011|um|fh
me011|and then uh the microphone issues.|s
me011|we want some way of specifying more than looking in the key file what channel and what mike what channel what mike and what broadcaster.|s
me011|or i don't know how to say it.|s^df^no
me011|so i mean with this one it's this particular headset with this particular transmitter as a wireless.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
mn014|yep.|b
me011|and you know that one is a different headset and different channel.|s
me011|and so we just need some naming conventions on that.|s
mn005|yeah.|b
me011|and uh|fh
mn005|uhhuh.|b
me011|that's going to become especially important once we start changing the microphone set up.|s^ba
me011|we have some new microphones that i'd like to start trying out.|s
me011|um|fh
me011|once i test them.|s
me011|and then we'll we'll need to specify that somewhere.|s
me011|so i was just going to do a fixed list of uh microphones and types.|s
mn005|yeah.|s^bk
mn014|okay.|s^bk
me011|so as i said|s.%-
me018|that sounds good.|s^ba
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um since we have such a short agenda list i guess i i will ask how how are the transcriptions going?|fh|qw^t^tc
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|the the news is that i've i uh|s.%--
fe008|so in um|%--
fe008|so i've switched to|s.%--
fe008|start my new sentence.|s
fe008|i i switched to doing the channel by channel transcriptions to provide uh the uh tighter time bins for partly for use in thilo's work.|s
fe008|and also it's of relevance to other people in the project.|s
fe008|and um i discovered in the process a couple of of interesting things.|s
fe008|which um|%--
fe008|one of them is that um it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this.|s
fe008|uh uh|fh
fe008|using an interface that has so much more complexity to it.|s
fe008|and i and i wanted to maybe ask uh chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency.|s^cs
fe008|maybe i was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts.|s^cs
fe008|and then piece them together later.|s^cs
fe008|and i i have a script.|s^cs
fe008|i can piece them together.|s^cs
fe008|i mean so it's like i i know that i can take them apart and put them together and i'll end up with the representation.|s
fe008|which is where the real power of that interface is.|s
fe008|and it may be that it's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one uh sound file and one uh set of of uh utterances to check through.|s^am^ba
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|i'm a little confused.|s
me013|i thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than uh the the other transcription uh thing was that that we were using the mixed file.|s
fe008|oh yes okay.|s^bk
fe008|but um with the mixed when you have an overlap you only have a a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap.|s^ng
fe008|which means that you're not tightly uh tuning the individual parts of that overlap by different speakers.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|so someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|and for purposes of of uh things like|s.%--
fe008|well so things like training the speech nonspeech segmentation thing.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|it's necessary to have it more tightly tuned than that.|s
me013|okay.|b
fe008|and and and you know it would be wonderful if uh it's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that.|s^ba
fe008|but um you know i've the|s.%--
fe008|so|fh
fe008|i don't know exactly where that's going at this point.|s^no
fe008|but i was experimenting with doing this by hand.|s
fe008|and|fh
fe008|i really do think that it's wise that we've had them start the way we have.|s^ba
fe008|with uh working off the mixed signal.|s
fe008|um|fh
fe008|having the interface that doesn't require them to do the uh the time bins for every single channel at a uh through the entire interaction.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|um i did discover a couple other things by doing this though.|s
fe008|and one of them is that.|s
fe008|um um|fh
fe008|once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber.|s
fe008|as you might expect.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|because when it's|s^df.%--
me013|sure.|b
fe008|a backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap.|s
fe008|and if we're going to study types of overlaps|s.%--
fe008|which is what i want to do.|s
fe008|an analysis of that|s^e.%--
fe008|then that really does require listening to every single channel all the way through the entire length for all the different speakers.|s
fe008|now for only four speakers that's not going to be too much time.|s^ba^bd
fe008|but if it's nine speakers then that that is more time.|s^df
fe008|so it's you know kind of wondering|s.%--
fe008|and i think again it's like this it's really valuable that thilo's working on the speech nonspeech segmentation.|s
fe008|because maybe um we can close in on that without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting.|s^df
mn014|yeah but those backchannels will always be a problem i think.|s^bk|s^ba^ng
mn014|uh especially if they're really short.|s
mn014|and they're not very loud.|s^e^rt
mn014|and so it it can it it will always happen that also the automatic detection system will miss some of them.|s
mn014|so|fh
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|well so then then maybe the answer is to uh listen especially densely in places of overlap.|s^cs
fe008|just so that they're they're not being overlooked because of that.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|and count on accuracy during the sparser phases.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|because there are large spaces of the|s^df.%--
fe008|that's a good point.|s^ba
fe008|there are large spaces where there's no overlap at all.|s
fe008|someone's giving a presentation.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|or whatever.|s^e
fe008|that's that's a good that's a good thought.|s^ba
fe008|and um let's see there was one other thing i was going to say.|fh|s
fe008|i i think it's really interesting data to work with.|s^ba
fe008|i have to say it's very enjoyable.|s
fe008|really not not a problem spending time with these data.|s
fe008|really interesting.|s^ba
fe008|and not just because i'm in there.|s^df
fe008|no it's real interesting.|s^ba^r
me013|uh well i think it's a short meeting.|fg|s^ba^t^tc
me013|uh you're you're you're still in the midst of what you're doing from what you described last time i assume.|s
mn005|is true.|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
mn005|i haven't results uh yet.|s
me013|and|fh
mn005|but uh|%--
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|i i'm continue working with the mixed signal now after the the last experience.|s
me013|yeah yeah.|b
mn005|and and i'm tried to to uh adjust the to to improve uh an harmonicity uh detector that uh i i implement.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|but i have problem.|s
mn005|because uh i get uh|s.%--
mn005|uh|fh
mn005|very much harmonics now.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|um harmonic possible harmonics.|s
mn005|uh|fh
mn005|uh and now i'm i'm i'm trying to to find uh some kind of a um of of help uh using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics and and other frequency peaks that uh not harmonics.|s
mn005|and|fh
mn005|uh i have to to talk with with you with the group uh about the instantaneous frequency.|s
mn005|because i have uh an algorithm.|s^df^rt
mn005|and i get|s.%--
mn005|huh uh|fh
mn005|results similar results like uh the paper uh that i i am following.|s
mn005|but uh the the rules uh that uh people used in the paper to to distinguish the harmonics is doesn't work well.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|and i i i i not sure that uh the the way to the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right.|s^no
mn005|or it's it's not right.|s^bsc
mn005|uh|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|i haven't enough feeling to to to distinguish what happened.|s
me013|yeah i'd like to talk with you about it.|fg|s
me013|if if if uh if i don't have enough time and you want to discuss with someone else|s.%--
me013|someone else besides us that you might want to talk to uh might be stephane.|s^cs
mn005|yeah.|s^bk
mn005|i talked with stephane and and thilo.|s
me013|yeah and and thilo.|s^bk|s^2
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and|fh
me013|yeah but|%-
mn005|they nnn they they they didn't|s.%-
mn014|i'm not too experienced with harmonics.|s^df
mn005|they think that the experience is not enough to|s.%-
me013|i see.|s^bk
mn014|and|fh
me018|is is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental?|qy
mn005|no no it's no|s^ar|%-
mn005|no.|s^ar
me018|and then hypothesize a new fundamental and get the energy.|s^e
mn005|no.|s^ar
me013|yeah that's|fg|%-
mn005|no i i i i don't process the the fundamental.|s^ar|s
mn005|i i um i calculate the the phase derivate using the f f t.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and|fh
mn005|the algorithm said that uh if you if you change the the the|s.%--
mn005|uh nnn|fh
mn005|the x the frequency x uh using the the instantaneous frequency.|s^rt
mn005|you can find uh how uh in several frequencies that probably the the harmonics uh|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|the errors of peaks the frequency peaks uh uh move around these uh uh frequency harmonic.|s
mn005|the frequency of the harmonic.|s^bsc
mn005|and uh if you if you compare the the instantaneous frequency uh of the of the uh continuous uh uh filters that uh that uh they used uh to to to get uh the the instantaneous frequency|fh|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn005|it probably too you can find uh that the instantaneous frequency for the continuous uh uh the output of the continuous filters are very near.|s^cs
mn005|and in my case in equal with our signal it doesn't happened.|s
me013|yeah i'd have to look at that and think about it.|fg|s
mn005|and|%-
me013|it's it's it's i haven't worked with that either.|s^df
me013|so i'm not sure.|s^no
me013|the way the simple minded way i suggested was what chuck was just saying is that you could make a a sieve.|s^cs
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|you know you actually say that here is|s.%--
me013|let's let's hypothesize that it's this frequency or that frequency.|s^e
me013|and and uh|fh
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to uh short cut it by by uh making some guesses.|s^cs
me013|but but uh uh uh|fh
me013|i would uh|s.%--
me013|i mean you could make some guesses from uh from the auto correlation or something.|s^cs
me013|but but then given those guesses try|s.%--
me013|um uh|fh
me013|only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency.|s^cs
me013|and and see how much of the|s^cs.%--
me013|take the one that's maximum.|s^cs
me013|call that the|s^cs.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|using the energy of the of the multiple of the frequency.|s^bu
me013|but|%-
me013|of all the harmonics of that yeah.|s^na|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|do you have to do some kind of uh low pass filter before you do that?|qy^bu^rt
mn005|i don't use.|s^nd
me018|or|qrr.%-
mn005|but i i know many people use uh low pass filter to to to get uh the pitch.|s^df
me013|no?|qy^br^m^rt
me013|to get the pitch yes.|s^na|s^aa
mn005|i don't use.|s^nd^r
mn014|to get the pitch yeah.|s^m^na|s^aa
mn005|to get the pitch yes.|s^m^na|s^aap
mn005|but the harmonic no.|s^df|s^ar
me018|but|%-
me018|but the harmonics are going to be|s.%--
me018|uh uh|fh
me018|i don't know what the right word is.|s^no
me018|um|fh
me018|they're going to be dampened by the uh vocal tract.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|the response of the vocal tract.|s^e
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn005|yeah.|b
me018|and so just looking at the energy on those at the harmonics is that going to|qy.%-
me013|well so the thing is that the|s.%--
me013|this is for|s.%--
me013|uh a um|fh
me018|i what you'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|and just look at the at at the signal coming out of the glottis.|s^e
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|uh well|h
me013|yeah that'd be good.|s^aa|s^ba
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|but uh but i but but i don't know that you need to.|s^arp^df
me011|open wide!|s^co^fe^j
me013|but i don't need you know if you need to get rid of it.|s^ng
me013|i mean that'd that'd be nice.|s^ba^bd
me013|but i don't know if it's if it's essential.|s^no
me013|um i mean because i think the main thing is that uh you're trying|s.%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|what are you doing this for?|qw^t1
me013|you're trying distinguish between the case where there is uh where where there are more than uh where there's more than one speaker.|s
me013|and the case where there's only one speaker.|s
me011|sorry.|s^fa^t3
me013|so if there's more than one speaker|s.%--
me013|um|fh
me013|yeah i guess you could i guess|s^aa|s^am.%--
me013|yeah you're so you're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced.|s
me013|so so if you don't if you don't care about that|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|see if you also want to just determine if you also want to determine whether it's unvoiced then i think you want to look look at high frequencies also.|s^cs
me013|because the the fact that there's more energy in the high frequencies is going to be an sort of obvious cue that it's unvoiced.|s^df
me018|yeah.|b
me013|but uh i mean|s.%--
me013|but um|fh
me013|other than that i guess as far as the one person versus two persons it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon.|s
me013|and if you looked at the low frequencies yes the higher frequencies are going to there's going to be a spectral slope.|s
me013|the higher frequencies will be lower energy.|s
me013|but so what?|qh
me013|i mean that's that's|%-
mn005|i will prepare for the next week uh all my results about the harmonicity.|s^cc
mn005|and will will try to come in|s^e.%--
mn005|and to discuss here|s^e.%--
mn005|because uh i haven't enough feeling to to many time to to understand what happened with the with uh so many peaks.|s^df
mn005|uh uh|fh
mn005|and i i see the harmonics there many time.|s
mn005|but uh there are a lot of peaks.|s^df
mn005|uh that uh they are not harmonics.|s
mn005|um|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|i have to discover what what is the the the best way to to to to use them.|s
me013|well but yeah i don't think you can i mean you're not going to be able to look at every frame.|s^bd
me013|so i mean|s.%--
me013|i i mean i i really i really thought that the best way to do it.|s
me013|and i'm speaking with no experience on this particular point.|s^bd^df
me013|but my impression was that the best way to do it was however you you've used instantaneous frequency whatever however you've come up you with your candidates you want to see how much of the energy is in that.|s^cs
mn005|yeah.|b
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|as as opposed to all of the all the total energy.|s
me013|and um if it's voiced|s.%--
me013|i guess so so i think maybe you do need a voiced unvoiced determination too.|s^cs
me013|but if it's voiced|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|b
me013|um and the uh|fh
me013|the fraction of the energy that's in the harmonic sequence that you're looking at is relatively low then it should be then it's more likely to be an overlap.|s
mn005|is height.|s^2
mn005|yeah.|s^bk
mn005|this this is the idea the idea i i i had.|s
mn005|to to compare the the ratio of the the energy of the harmonics with the uh with the uh total energy in the spectrum.|s
mn005|and try to get a ratio to to distinguish between overlapping and speech.|s
mn005|huh.|b
me013|but you're looking you're looking at|s.%--
me013|let's take a second with this.|s^co
me013|uh uh|fh
me013|you're looking at at the phase derivative.|s^bu
me013|um|fh
me013|in in uh|%--
me013|what domain?|qw
me013|i mean this is this is in in in in bands?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|or or|qrr.%--
mn005|no no no.|s^ar
me013|just just overall|s.%-
mn005|it's a it's a|%-
mn005|the band the band is uh from zero to to four kilohertz.|s
mn005|and i i i|%-
me013|and you just take the instantaneous frequency.|s^bu
mn005|yeah i i i used two two method two methods.|z
mn005|uh one uh based on the f uh f t t.|z
mn005|to f f t|z
mn005|to to obtain the or to study the harmonics|z
mn005|from from the spectrum directly|z
mn005|and to study the energy and the multiples of|z
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|frequency.|z
mn005|and another another algorithm i have|z
mn005|is the in the instantaneous frequency|z
mn005|based on on|z
mn005|on the f f t to|z
mn005|to to calculate the the phase derivate|z
mn005|in the time.|z
mn005|uh uh the|z
mn005|i mean i i have two two algorithms.|z
me013|right.|b
mn005|but uh in in my opinion the the the instantaneous frequency|z
mn005|the the the behavior|z
mn005|uh was|z
mn005|it was very interesting.|z
mn005|because i i saw uh how the spectrum concentrate uh|z
me013|oh.|b
mn005|around the the harmonic.|z
mn005|but then|z
mn005|when i apply the the rule|z
mn005|uh of the in the the instantaneous frequency of the of the continuous filter in the the near filter|z
mn005|the the rule that uh people propose in the paper|z
mn005|doesn't work.|z
mn005|and i don't know|z
mn005|why.|z
me013|but the instantaneous frequency|s.%--
me013|wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know of the where most of the energy is?|qy^rt
me013|i mean i think if you|s.%--
me013|does does it why would it correspond to pitch?|qw
mn005|yeah.|z
mn005|i i i not sure.|z
mn005|i i i try to to|z
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|when first i i calculate uh using the f f t|z
fe008|digital camera.|s
mn005|the the|z
me011|keep forgetting.|s^t1
mn005|i get the the spectrum|z
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and i represent|z
mn005|all the frequency.|z
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and when|z
mn005|i obtained the instantaneous frequency.|z
mn005|and i change the the the|z
mn005|using the|z
mn005|instantaneous frequency here.|z
me013|oh so you scale you you do a a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous.|s^bk|s^bu
mn005|i use|z
mn005|yeah.|z
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|it's a kind of normalization.|s^bu^e
mn005|yeah.|z
mn005|because when when|z
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn005|uh when|z
mn005|i i use these these frequency|z
mn005|uh the range is different and the resolution is different.|z
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and|z
mn005|i observe|z
mn005|more|z
mn005|more or less|z
mn005|thing like this.|z
mn005|and|z
mn005|the paper said that uh|z
mn005|these frequencies|z
mn005|are probably|z
mn005|uh harmonics.|z
me013|i see.|s^bk
mn005|but uh they used|z
me013|huh.|b
mn005|uh a rule|z
mn005|uh|z
mn005|based in the in the|z
mn005|because|z
mn005|to to calculate the|z
mn005|instantaneous frequency|z
mn005|they use a hanning window.|z
me013|yeah.|b
mn005|and they said that uh|z
mn005|if these peak are uh harmonics|z
mn005|the|z
mn005|instantaneous frequency|z
mn005|of the|z
mn005|contiguous|z
mn005|uh uh|z
mn005|uh filters|z
mn005|are very near|z
mn005|or have to be very near.|z
mn005|but uh phh!|z
mn005|i don't|z
mn005|i i i i|z
mn005|i and i don't know what is the|z
mn005|what is the distance.|z
mn005|and i tried to to put different distance|z
mn005|uh|z
mn005|to put difference uh|z
mn005|uh length of the window|z
mn005|uh different front sieve|z
mn005|pfff!|z
mn005|and i i not sure what happened.|z
me013|okay yeah well i i guess i'm not following it enough.|s^bk|s
me013|probably going to have to look at the paper.|s
me013|but which i'm not going to have time to do in the next few days.|s
me013|but but i'm i'm curious about it.|s^ba
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|um uh|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe008|i did it did occur to me that this is uh the return to the transcription.|s^t^tc
fe008|that there's one third thing i wanted to to raise as a as an issue.|s^t^tc
fe008|which is um how to handle breaths.|s
fe008|so i wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are.|s
fe008|and the reason i ask the question is|s.%--
fe008|um aside from the fact that they're obviously very time consuming to encode|s.%--
fe008|uh the fact that there was some|s.%--
fe008|i had the indication from dan ellis in the email that i sent to you.|s
fe008|and you know about|s.%--
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|that in principle we might be able to um handle breaths by by using cross talk from the other things.|s^cs
fe008|be able that|%--
fe008|in principle maybe we could get rid of them.|s^cs
fe008|so maybe|%--
fe008|and i was|s.%--
fe008|i i don't know.|s^no
fe008|i mean we had this|s.%--
fe008|and i didn't couldn't get back to you.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|but the question of whether it'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal.|s
fe008|which would be the ideal situation.|s^ba
fe008|because|%-
me013|i don't know think it'd be ideal.|s^nd
me018|uh uh.|s^ar
me013|see we're we're dealing with real speech.|s^df
me013|and we're trying to have it be as real as possible.|s^df
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|and breaths are part of real speech.|s^df^e
fe008|well except that these are really truly|s^nd.%--
fe008|i mean there's a segment in the one i did|s.%--
fe008|the first one that i did for for this.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|where truly we're hearing you breathing like as if we're you're in our ear.|s^df
fe008|you know and it's like it's like|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|i mean breath is natural.|s^na
fe008|but not|s.%--
me013|it is but it is if you record it.|s^ng
mn005|yeah.|b
fe008|except that we're we're trying to mimic|s^nd.%--
fe008|oh i see what you're saying.|s^bk
fe008|you're saying that the p d a application would have uh have to cope with breath.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|well|%-
fe008|but|%-
me018|any application may have to.|s^aap
mn014|no.|s^ar
me011|the p d a might not have to.|s^nd
mn014|no|%-
me011|but more people than just p d a users are interested in this corpus.|s^df
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|okay then the then i have two questions.|s^bk|s
me011|so so mean you're right.|s
me011|we could remove it.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|but i i think we don't want to remove it from the corpus in terms of delivering it.|s^cs
me011|because the people will want it in there.|s^df
fe008|okay so maybe the question is notating it.|s^bk|s^cs
me013|yeah if it gets|fg|%-
fe008|yeah?|qw
me013|yeah i right.|fg
me013|if if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might want to have some method which will allow you to block it.|s
me013|but you it's real data.|s^df
me013|you don't want to but you don't|s^cs.%--
fe008|okay well|s^bk|%-
me013|if you know if there's a little bit of noise out there and somebody is is talking about something they're doing that's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting|s.%--
me013|even and|%--
me013|we have the uh the uh the the fan and the in the projector up there.|s
me013|and uh this is it's this is actual stuff that we we want to work with.|s
fe008|well this is very interesting.|s^ba
me013|so|fh
fe008|because it basically has a it shows very clearly the contrast between uh speech recognition research and discourse research.|s^df
fe008|because in in discourse and linguistic research what counts is what's communicative.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and breath|s.%--
fe008|you know everyone breathes.|s
fe008|they breathe all the time.|s^e
fe008|and once in a while breath is communicative.|s^bd^df
fe008|but very rarely.|s^df
fe008|okay so now i had a discussion with chuck about the data structure.|fg|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a|s.%--
fe008|there'll be a master transcript.|s
fe008|which has in it everything that's needed for both of these uses.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and the one that's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts.|s
fe008|you know like don's been writing scripts.|s
fe008|and and|fh
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|uh to process it for the speech recognition side.|s
fe008|discourse side will have|s.%--
fe008|this this side over the we'll have a|%--
fe008|sorry not being very fluent here.|s^fa|s
fe008|but um|fh
fe008|this the discourse side will have a script which will strip away the things which are non communicative.|s
fe008|okay so then the then let's let's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths.|s
fe008|so what i would what i would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically?|qy
fe008|could we get a breath detector?|qy
me011|oh just to save the transcribers time.|s^bk|s^bu
fe008|well i mean you just have no idea.|s^df^na
fe008|i mean if you're getting a breath several times every minute.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate to put the boundaries in to to type it in it's just a huge amount of time.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn014|oops.|s^t1.%
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|what|%-
fe008|and you want to be sure it's used.|s^cs
fe008|and you want to be sure it's done as efficiently as possible.|s
fe008|and if it can be done automatically that would be ideal.|s
me013|what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries?|qh
fe008|well but|%-
me013|so you just know it's between these other things.|s^bu
fe008|well okay so now there's there's another another possibility.|fg|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|which is um the time boundaries could mark off words from nonwords.|s^cs
fe008|and that would be extremely time effective if that's sufficient.|s
me013|yeah i mean i'm if it's too if it's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se we are going to be building up models for these things.|fg|s
me013|and these things are somewhat self aligning.|s
me013|so if so we if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a breath or a breath in or breath out the models will learn that sort of thing.|s
me013|uh so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are.|s
fe008|okay but that would maybe include a pause as well.|s^bk|s
me013|so|fh
me018|well there's there's|%-
fe008|and that wouldn't be a problem to have it uh pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze.|s
me013|yeah|fg|%-
me013|you know there is there's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything as you know.|s
me013|and and and|fh
me013|marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods.|s
me013|basically the more we can mark the better.|s
me013|but if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area|s.%--
me013|and this might be one like this.|s
me013|although i i i'd be interested to get get input from liz and andreas on this to see if they|s.%--
me013|because they've got lots of experience with the breaths in in uh uh their transcripts.|s^df
me018|i|%-
me011|they have lots of experience with breathing?|qy^bu^d^j^rt
me013|actually|%-
me013|well yes they do.|s^aa|s
me013|but we we can handle that without them here.|s
me013|but but but uh|fh
me013|you were going to say something about|s.%-
me018|yeah i i think um one possible way that we could handle it is that|s^aa|s.%--
me018|um|fh
me018|you know as the transcribers are going through and if they get a hunk of speech that they're going to transcribe|s.%--
me018|they're going to transcribe it because there's words in there or what not.|s
me018|if there's a breath in there they could transcribe that.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|that's what they've been doing.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|right.|b
fe008|so within an overlap segment they they do this.|s
me018|but|%-
me018|right but if there's a big hunk of speech let's say on morgan's mike where he's not talking at all um don't don't worry about that.|fg|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|so what we're saying is there's no guarantee that um|s.%--
me018|so for the chunks that are transcribed everything's transcribed.|s
me018|but outside of those boundaries there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribed.|s
me018|so you just somebody can't rely on that data and say that's perfectly clean data.|s
me018|uh do you see what i'm saying?|qy
fe008|yeah you're saying it's uncharted territory.|s^aa|s^na
me018|so i would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that's outside of a grouping of words.|s^cs
me013|that sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise.|s^na
mn014|yeah and that's that that quite corresponds to the way i i try to train the speech nonspeech detector.|fg|s
mn014|as i really try to not to detect those breaths.|s
mn014|which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn014|and they so they hopefully won't be marked in in those channel specific files.|s
me018|yeah so|%-
mn014|but|fh
me013|i i wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|see in a in a way this is a really key point.|s
me013|that for speech recognition uh research|s.%--
me013|uh um|fh
me013|a it's not just a minor part.|s
me013|in fact the i i would say the core thing that we're trying to do is to recognize the actual meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful.|s
me013|so it's critical|s.%--
me013|it's not just incidental.|s^e
me013|it's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful.|s
me013|because that's what we're trying to pull the other out of.|s^df
me013|that's our problem.|s
me013|if we had nothing|s.%--
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|if we had only linguistically relevant things|s.%--
me013|if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words with different spectral components|s.%--
me013|and uh we we didn't have noise|s.%--
me013|we didn't have convolutional errors.|s
me013|we didn't have extraneous uh behaviors and so forth.|s
me013|and moving your head.|s
me013|and all these sorts of things.|s
me013|then actually speech recognition isn't that bad right now.|s^ba
me013|i mean you can|s.%--
mn005|yeah.|z
me013|you know it's it's the technology's come along pretty well.|s^ba
me013|the the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart.|s
fe008|okay fair enough.|s^bk|s^ba
fe008|i guess um i uh what i was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem?|qw
fe008|because if it were likely that a p d a would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing so it wouldn't even have to be processed at at this computational|s^df.%--
fe008|well let me see it'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it.|s^bd
fe008|but if there were uh likely on the frontier a good breath extractor|s.%--
fe008|then um and then you'd have to|s.%-
me013|but that's a research question.|s^bd
me013|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me013|and so|%-
fe008|yeah well see and that's what i wouldn't know.|s^bk|s^df
me013|that|%-
me013|and we don't either.|s
me013|i mean so so the thing is it's it|s.%--
me013|right now it's just raw it's just data that we're collecting.|s
me013|and so we don't want to presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations.|s
me013|because that's actually the research that we're trying to feed.|s^df
fe008|okay.|b
me013|so you know and maybe maybe in five years it'll work really well.|s
me013|and and it'll only mess up ten percent of the time.|s
me013|but then we would still want to account for that ten percent.|s
fe008|i guess there's another aspect.|s
me013|so|fh
fe008|which is that as we've improved our microphone technique we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent uh recordings.|s^df
fe008|so it's in a way it's an artifact that there's so much on the on the earlier ones.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|i see.|s^bk
me018|one of the|%--
me018|um just to add to this|s.%--
me018|one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them.|s
me018|i mean that's what a lot of people do nowadays.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|right.|b
me018|and so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked.|s
mn005|yeah.|z
me018|so that you know where the boundaries are.|s^df
mn005|huh|z
me013|yeah.|b
me018|so|fh
me018|i mean i don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a you know conversation.|s
me018|we don't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all.|s^cs
me018|but i mean if they're there while they're transcribing some hunk of words i'd say put them in if possible.|s^cs
fe008|okay and it's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other.|s^bk|s
fe008|because of the way the microphone's adjusted.|s^df
mn005|yeah.|z
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|should we do the digits?|qy^rt^t^tc
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|okay.|z
mn005|okay.|z
me001|huh all right.|z
mn014|channel.|z
mn017|what channel am i on?|z
mn017|oh channel two.|z
fe016|make sure to turn your microphone on.|z
fe016|there's a battery.|z
mn014|channel.|z
me001|there we go.|z
fe016|okay.|z
fe016|your channel number's already on this blank sheet.|z
me001|yeah.|z
fe016|so you just if you can|z
me013|channel five?|z
me013|channel five.|z
mn014|channel whatever.|z
me013|i'm on channel five.|z
me001|camera one camera two.|z
mn014|what am i?|z
me013|little low?|z
mn014|channel four?|z
me013|channel five.|z
mn014|this number four?|z
me013|channel five.|z
mn014|okay.|z
me013|okay.|z
fe016|the the gain's up at it what it usually is.|z
fe016|but if you think it's|z
me013|is it?|z
fe016|yeah it's sort of a default.|z
fe016|but i can set it higher if you like.|z
me013|oh.|z
me013|maybe it should be a little higher.|z
fe016|yeah?|z
me013|it's not showing much.|z
me013|test test test test test test test test test test.|z
me013|okay that that seems better?|z
me013|yeah?|z
me013|okay good.|z
me013|uh that's good that's good.|z
me013|okay.|z
me013|ahh huh|z
me013|so i i had a question for adam.|s^t^tc
me013|have we started already?|qy^rt
fe016|well we started recording but yeah.|s^na
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|is jane around?|qy
me013|or|qrr.%--
me018|i saw her earlier.|s^na
me013|uh|b
fe016|she can just walk in i guess or|s.%--
me018|i think|%-
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me013|right.|s^aa
me018|she'll probably come up.|s
fe016|since we're starting late i figured we'd better just start.|s^cs
me013|yeah great idea.|s^ba
me013|i was going to ask adam to uh say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff.|s^t
me013|because it occurred to me that this is late may and the darpa meeting is in mid july.|s^df
me013|uh but i don't remember what we|fh|s^no.%--
me013|i know that we were going to do something with the transcriber interface is one thing.|s
me013|but i thought there was a second thing.|s
me013|anybody remember?|qy^d^rt
fe016|well we were going to do a mock up like question answering or something i thought.|fg|s
fe016|that was totally separate from the interface.|s^e^rt
fe016|do you remember?|qy^rt
fe016|remember like asking questions and retrieving but in a pre stored fashion.|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|right.|b
fe016|that was the thing we talked about i think before the transcriber|s.%-
fe016|come on in.|s^co^t3
me013|yeah.|b
me013|all right so anyway you have to sort out that out.|s^co
me013|and get somebody going on it.|s^co
me013|because we're got a got a month left basically.|s^df
me013|so|fh
fe016|you like these.|s^bu
fe016|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|okay good.|s^bk
me013|okay.|fg
me013|um|fh
me013|okay so what are we else we got?|qw^t^tc
me013|you got you just wrote a bunch of stuff.|s
fe016|no that was all um previously here.|s^ar|s
me013|oh.|s^bk
fe016|i was writing the digits and then i realized i could xerox them.|s^na
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|oh.|s^bk
fe016|because i didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones.|s^df
fe016|so|fh
fe016|we all by the way have the same digit form for the record.|s
fe016|so|fh
me013|that's cool.|s^ba
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so the choice is uh which which do we want more the the the comparison uh of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that|qr.%-
fe016|it's just because i didn't have any more digit sheets.|s
me013|i know that.|s^aa
fe016|so|fh
me013|but you know which opportunity should we|qw.%-
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|unison.|s
fe016|i mean it actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings.|fg|s^cs
me013|unison.|s^aa^m
fe016|i mean we could use them for normalizing or something.|s^cs
fe016|but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison.|s^rt
me013|i guess we'll see.|s^am
fe016|i don't know.|s^no
me013|i guess it's dependent on|s.%--
fe016|see how long we go.|s
me013|how long we go and how good the snack is out there.|s^e^m
me013|yeah huh get some advance intelligence.|s^e
mn014|but anyway they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes you know saying o and so it's not not identical.|s
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|right.|b
me013|yeah we'd have to train.|s^co^na
fe016|we'd be like a chorus.|s^j
mn014|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah we'd have to get get some experience.|s^co
mn017|greek chorus.|s^2^j
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|yes.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|really boring chorus.|s^ba^j
me013|um do we have an agenda?|fh|qy^t^tc
me013|adam usually tries to put those together but he's ill.|s^df
me018|i've got a couple of things to talk about.|s^na^t
me013|so|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|uh what what might those be?|qw
me018|uh i b m stuff and um just getting uh meeting information organized.|h|s^t
me013|meeting info organized.|s^m
me013|okay.|s^bk^rt
me013|um|fh
mn017|are you implying that it's currently disorganized?|qy^rt
me018|in my mind.|s^na
me013|is there stuff that's happened about um uh the s r i recognizer et cetera?|qy
me013|those things that were happening before with|s^e.%--
me013|you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front ends and then with|s.%--
mn017|well|fg
me013|is is that still sort of where it was uh the other day?|qy^rt
mn017|we're improving.|s^nd
me013|we're improving.|s^bu^m
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me018|now the the you saw the note that the p l p now is getting basically the same as the m f c c.|s
me013|right.|s^aa
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|right.|b
mn017|yeah actually it looks like it's getting better.|fg|s^ba
me013|oh.|s^bk
mn017|so but but it's not|s.%-
me013|just with with age kind of.|s^2
mn017|with age yeah.|s^aa^m
me013|yeah yeah.|b
mn017|but uh that's not directly related to me.|s
mn017|doesn't mean we can't talk about it.|s
mn017|um it seems it looks i haven't the it's the experiment is still not complete.|fh|s
mn017|but|fh
mn017|um it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully actually.|fh|s^ba
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|using the warp factors that we computed for the s r i system and just applying them to the icsi front end.|s^df
me013|that's pretty funny.|s^j
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|so you just need to copy over to this one.|s^co
me013|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn017|just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me013|uh!|s^fe
me013|yeah well that's always good to do.|s^bk|s^ba
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|b
me013|okay|fg
me013|uh|fh
mn017|but one issue actually that just came up in discussion with liz and and don was um as far as meeting recognition is concerned um we would really like to uh move uh to uh doing the recognition on automatic segmentations.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|because in all our previous experiments we had the uh you know we were essentially cheating by having the um you know the the hand segmentations as the basis of the recognition.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and so now with thilo's segmenter working so well i think we should consider doing a|s^cs.%-
mn014|huh so.|b
me001|come on.|s^co^t3
mn014|yeah we but|%-
me013|think you think we should increase the error rate?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|uh doing|s^e.%-
mn014|anyway yeah.|fg|s^bk
me013|good.|s^ba
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
mn014|that's what i wanted to do anyway.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
mn014|so we should just get together and|s^cs.%-
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|and even the good thing is that since you um have high recall even if you have low precision because you're over generating that's good.|s^ba
fe016|because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of uh transients and things that come from the microphones.|s^df
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|s^aa
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|but i know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform we do very poorly because we're we're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out.|s^df
mn017|well|fg
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so we do need some kind of pre segmentation.|s
mn017|we should we should consider doing some extra things like um you know retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment for instance.|s^cs
fe016|huh|b
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|and yeah using thilo's you know posteriors or some kind of or|s^cs.%--
mn017|so|fh
fe016|right now they're they're discrete.|s
fe016|yes or no for a speaker to consider those particular speaker background models.|s^e
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|so|fh
mn017|right.|b
fe016|there's lots of interesting things that could be done.|s
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|yeah we should do that.|s^na
fe016|so|fh
me013|good.|fg
me013|so uh why don't we uh do the i b m stuff?|qh^rt^t^tc
me013|you had some thing about that?|qy^d^rt
me018|yeah so um talked with brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before.|s^aa|s
me013|right.|b
me018|and so|fh
me013|the uh chuck chunks.|s^2^j
me018|yeah.|fh
mn014|huh|b
me018|the chuck chunks.|s^j^m
me018|right.|fh
me018|and so he talked it over with the transcriber.|s
me018|and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the a number a digit and then a beep uh at the beginning of each one.|s^cs^e
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|and that would help keep them from getting lost.|s^df
me018|and um so adam wrote a little script to generate those style uh beeps.|fh|s
me018|and so we're|s.%-
mn017|where'd you get the digits from?|qw
me018|i came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten.|s
fe008|they sound really good.|s^ba
me018|so|fh
fe016|that's a great idea.|s^ba
me018|does it sound okay?|qy^rt
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me018|so um yeah we just used those.|s
mn017|and do you splice them into the waveform?|qy
mn017|or|qrr.%--
me018|yeah he then he i recorded actually i recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked.|s^aa|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me018|he liked the fastest one so he just cut those out and spliced them in between uh two beeps.|s
mn014|it will be funny.|s^ba
fe008|it sounds like a radio announcer's voice really.|s^ba
mn014|uh|%-
me018|does it?|qh
fe008|yeah yeah.|b
mn014|it will be funny when you're really reading digits and then there are the chunks with with your digits in.|s^ba^j^rt
me018|yeah with my|s^aa|s.%-
fe016|oh right.|s^bk
fe008|oh that's right.|s^aa
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|that'll throw them.|s
fe008|now actually|%-
me018|huh?|qy^d^g
fe008|we're are we handling|qy.%-
me013|uh maybe we should have you record a b c for those or something.|s^cs^j
me018|huh maybe.|s^am
me018|and she said it wasn't going to the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem because they can actually make a template uh that has beep number beep.|s^df
mn014|okay.|s^bk
me018|so for them it'll be very quick.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me018|to to put those in there when they're transcribing.|s^e
me018|so um we we're going to send them one more sample meeting.|s^cc
me018|uh and thilo has run his segmentation.|s
me018|adam's going to generate the chunked file.|s
me018|and then um i'll give it to brian and they can try that out.|s^cc
me018|and when we get that back we'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with uh too many beeps in the last transcription.|s
me013|okay do do what do you have any idea of the turn around on on those steps you just said?|s^bk|qy^rt
fe016|great.|b
me013|uh|fh
me018|uh our our on our side?|h|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|or including i b m's?|qrr
me013|including i b m's.|s
me018|well i don't know.|s^no
me018|the last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks.|s
me013|okay.|b
me018|um maybe even three.|fh|s^e
me018|uh that's just the i b m side.|fh|s
me018|our side is quick.|s
me018|i mean i i don't know how long does your|qw.%-
mn014|it should be finished today or something yeah.|s
me013|well i meant the overall thing.|s
me013|the reason i'm asking is because uh jane and i have just been talking and she's just been doing uh a you know further hiring of transcribers.|s^df
me018|yeah.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|and so we don't sort of really know exactly what they'll be doing how long they'll be doing it and so forth.|s
me013|because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working.|s^df
me018|right.|b
me013|and uh|fh
me013|so it'd be it'd be good to sort of get that resolved uh soon as we could.|s^co
me018|yeah.|fg
me013|and then|%-
me018|i yeah i i hope we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me018|so um|fh
me018|i i don't know yet how long that'll take.|s^no
me013|yeah um|fh
me013|i mean in particular i would i would really hope that when we do this darpa meeting in july that we sort of have we're we're into production mode somehow.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|you know that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|i think that would that would certainly be a a very good thing to know.|s^ba
me018|right right.|s^aa
me013|okay.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions.|s^cs^t^tc
fe008|okay so um we uh the transcribers have continued to work past what i'm calling set one.|fg|s
fe008|which was the the set that i've been uh okay talking about up to this point.|s^e
fe008|but uh they've gotten five meetings done in that set.|s
fe008|right now they're in the process of being edited.|s
fe008|um the um|fh|%--
fe008|let's see.|s^co
fe008|i hired two transcribers today i'm thinking of hiring another one.|s
fe008|which will because we've had a lot of attrition.|s^df^e
fe008|and that will bring our total to|s.%-
me013|they die off after they do this for a while.|s^j
fe008|yeah.|b
me018|burn out.|s^j
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|well you know it's it's various things.|s^df
fe008|so one of them had a baby um you know one of them really wasn't planning|s^df.%-
mn017|oh that was an unforeseen side effect of|s^j.%-
fe008|uh one of them um had never planned to work past january.|s^df
fe008|i mean it's all these various things.|s
fe008|because we you know we presented it as possibly a month project back in january.|s^df
fe008|and and and and um|fh
fe008|so it makes sense.|s
fe008|uh through attrition we we've we're down to to two but they're really solid.|s
fe008|we're really lucky the two that we kept.|s^ba
fe008|and um well i don't mean i don't mean anything against the others what i mean is we've got a good cause a good core no we had a good core.|s^bd
fe016|well they won't hear this since they're going they won't be transcribing this meeting.|s^j
fe008|yeah but still i mean i it's just a matter of we we're we've got uh|s.%-
me013|no backs.|s^j
fe008|two of the ones who who um had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they're continuing to put in a a lot of hours.|s
fe008|which is wonderful and excellent work.|s^ba
fe008|and so then in addition um i hired two more today and i'm planning to hire a third one with this within this coming week.|s^cc
fe008|but but the plan is just as uh morgan was saying we discussed this and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side.|s
fe008|you know?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|rather than hiring like eight to ten right now.|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|because if the i b m thing comes through really quickly then um we wouldn't want to have to uh you know lay people off and stuff.|s^df
fe008|so|fh
fe008|and this way it'll i mean i got really a lot of response for for my notice.|s^df
fe008|and i think i could hire additional people if i wish to.|s
me013|yeah and the other thing is i mean in the unlikely event|s.%--
me013|and since we're so far from this it's a little hard to plan this way.|s
me013|in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have uh transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs.|s
me013|because you know there's you know all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they're and they're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh than the generation.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|uh in in the day event that that day actually dawns uh i i bet we could find some other stuff for them to do.|s^cs
me013|so i i think that uh uh as we were talking if we if we hire twelve then we could you know run into a problem later.|s
fe008|oh yes.|s^aa
me013|i mean we also just couldn't sustain that forever.|s
me013|but but um for all sorts of reasons.|s
me013|but if we hire you know we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time then it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way.|s^cs
fe008|good.|s^ba
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|good.|b.%
fe016|it'd be great too if um we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries.|s^cs^rt
fe016|or some hand to experiment with um you know to have a ground truth for this segmentation work.|s^cs
fe016|which i guess you have some already that was really helpful and we could probably use more.|s^cs
mn014|huh yeah that was a thing i i planned working on is uh to use the the transcriptions which are done by now and to to use them as uh|fg|s^na.%-
fe016|oh.|b
fe016|oh the new ones.|s^2
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|with the tighter boundaries yeah.|s^2^e
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|and to use them for for training a or for whatever yeah.|s
mn014|to to create some speech nonspeech labels out of them.|s
mn014|and yeah but that that's a thing was what i'm just looking into.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe008|the the the pre segmentations are so much are so extremely helpful.|s^ba^tc
fe008|now there was uh i guess|s.%--
fe008|so a couple weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation.|s
fe008|for just very few days you were away.|s
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|but it happened to be during that time i needed one.|s
fe008|so i so i started them on the non-pre-segmented and then switched them over to yours.|s
fe008|and um they um you know they always appreciate that when they have that available.|fh|s
fe008|and he's uh usually uh uh um um|s.%--
fe008|so they really appreciate it.|s
fe008|but i was going to say that they do adjust it once in a while.|s
fe008|you know once in a while there's something like|s.%--
mn014|yeah sure.|s^aa
fe008|um and actually you talked to them.|s^bu
fe008|didn't you?|qy^g
fe008|did you have you|qy.%-
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
mn014|i talked to helen.|s^na
fe008|and and and she was|s.%--
fe008|and so i asked her|s.%--
fe008|i mean they're very perceptive.|s
fe008|i really want to have this meeting of the transcribers.|s
fe008|i haven't done it yet but i want to do that.|s^cc
fe008|and she's out of town um for a couple of weeks but i want to do that when she returns.|s^cc
fe008|um because she was saying you know in a in a span of very short period we asked it seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these these these things.|fh|s^df
fe008|and she was saying the short utterances uh the um|s.%--
fe016|huh|b
mn014|huh|b
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|you know i mean you're you're aware of this.|s
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|but but actually it's so correct for so much of the time that it's an enormous time saver.|s^ba
fe008|and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries.|s
fe016|that's great.|s^ba
fe008|so|fh
fe008|um yeah i think it'd be interesting to combine these.|fh|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|is there actually a record of where they change?|qy^rt
fe016|i mean you can compare do a diff on the|s^cs.%--
fe016|just so that we knew|s^df.%-
fe008|you could do it.|s^na
fe008|it's it's complicated in that um hhh hhh|s.%--
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|actually when when they create new yeah new segments or something it will be uh not that easy.|s^ba
mn014|but huh i think one could do that.|s^na
fe016|i mean if we keep a old copy of the old time marks j.|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|just so that if we run it we know whether we're which ones were cheating.|s^df
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|and|%-
mn014|that would be great yeah to know that.|s^ba
fe008|there is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what i do is i merge what they've done with the pre segmented version.|s
fe016|which one would be good.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|so it's not a pure it's not a pure condition.|s
fe008|what you'd really like is that they started with pre segmented and were pre segmented all the way through.|s^cs
fe016|uhhuh.|b
fe008|and um i uh the|%--
fe008|it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones.|s
fe008|but it will be possible in the future.|s^cc
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|because we we're um|s^df.%--
fe016|huh that's great.|s^ba
mn014|it would.|s^na
mn014|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|yeah as long as we have a record i guess of the original automatic one we can always find out how well we would do from the recognition side by using those boundaries.|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|um|fh
fe016|you know a completely non cheating version.|s^e
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|also if you need someone to record this meeting i mean i'm happy to for the transcribers|s^cc.%--
fe016|i could do it or chuck or adam.|s^cc
fe008|thank you.|s^ft.%
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so uh you were saying something about organizing the meeting info?|fh|qy^bu^rt^t^tc
me018|yeah so um uh jane and adam and i had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting|s^aa|s.%-
me013|did you record it?|qy^j^rt
me018|no.|s^ar
me018|for all the meeting recorder data.|s^e
me018|we should have.|s^bd
me018|um and so we've got a plan for what we're going to do there.|fh|s
me018|and then jane also prepared a um started getting all of the the meetings organized so she prepared a a spreadsheet which i spent the last couple of days adding to.|s
me018|so i went through all of the data that we have collected so far and have.|s
me018|been putting it into uh a spreadsheet with start time the date the old meeting name the new meeting name the number of speakers the duration of the meeting comments you know what its transcription status is all that kind of stuff.|s
me018|and so the idea is that we can take this and then export it as h t m l and put it on the meeting recorder web page.|s^df
fe016|oh great.|s^ba
me018|so we can keep people updated about what's going on.|s^df
me018|um i've got to get some more information from jane.|fh|s^cc
me018|because i have some some gaps here that i need to get her to fill in.|s^df
me018|but so far um as of monday the fourteenth um we've had a total number of sixty two hours of meetings that we have collected.|s
me018|and um|fh
me018|uh some other interesting things average number of speakers per meeting is six.|s
me018|um|fh
me018|and i'm going to have on here the total amount that's been transcribed so far.|s^cc
me018|but i've got a bunch of|s.%--
me018|uh that's what i have to talk to jane about figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth.|s
me018|but um this'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones.|s
me018|and it'll also list uh like under the status if it's at i b m or if it's at icsi uh or if it's completed or which ones we're excluding.|s
me018|and and there's a place for comments so we can um say why we're excluding things and so forth.|s
me018|so|fh
me013|now would the ones that um are already transcribed we we have enough there that|s.%--
me013|you know we've already done some studies and so forth.|s
me013|and|fh
me013|um shouldn't we go through and do the business of of having the um uh participants approve it uh for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth?|fh|qy^cs
fe008|um interesting idea.|s^ba
fe008|in principle i i would say yes although i still am doing some the final pass editing.|s^aap
fe008|trying to convert it over to the master file as the being the channelized version.|s
fe008|and it's yeah it seems like i get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes and i have to stop.|s^bd
fe008|cleaning up the things like the uh uh places where the transcriber was uncertain.|s
fe008|and and doing spot checking here and there.|s
fe008|so um uh i guess it would make sense to wait until that's done.|fh|s^cs
fe008|um but but|fh|%-
me013|well let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as i did with the uh uh the the pipeline.|s^co
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|um we are going to have this darpa meeting in the middle of july.|fh|s
me013|and i think it it'd be|s.%--
fe008|yes.|s^aa
me013|given that we've been we've given a couple public talks about it already spaced by months and months i think it'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available.|s
me013|um|fh
fe008|it'll certainly be done by then yeah.|s
me013|right so we can we we want to be able to say here is a subset that is available right now.|fg|s^cs:s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|that's right.|b
me013|and that's has been through the legal issues and so forth.|s^e
fe008|that's right.|b
me013|so|fh
fe008|yeah that's right so that|s^aa|%-
me013|okay?|qy^d^g^rt
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|so by before july.|fh|s^e
mn017|and they don't have to approve you know an edited version they can just give their approval to whatever version.|s
fe008|well maybe|fg
me013|well in principle yes but i mean if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then|s^aap.%-
mn017|yeah but i mean the editing will continue presumably if if errors are found they will be fixed.|s^arp
mn017|but they won't change the the content of the meetings.|s^e
me018|content really.|s^2
fe008|well see this is the this is the issue subtleties.|s
mn017|so|fh
fe016|well if jane is clarifying question question then you know how can they agree to it before they know her final version?|qh
fe008|the other thing too is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word which could've been transcribed in the other way.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|thing|%-
fe008|and and they wouldn't have been slanderous if it had been this other word.|s
fe008|you know?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|it you know there is a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous.|s^na
me013|because you know you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say you know that should be a period and not a question mark.|s^df
me013|right?|qh^rt
me013|and you don't you there's no way that we're going to go back and ask everybody do you approve this uh you know this document now.|s:qy
me013|so|fh
me013|so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i haven't looked at it in a while but it has to be open enough that it sort of says okay from now on you know now that i've read this you can use do anything you want with these data.|s:s^co
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|and uh but i think we want to|s.%--
me013|so assuming that it's in that kind of wording which i don't remember um i think we just want to have enough confidence ourselves that it's so close to the final form it's going to be in a year from now that they're|s^cs.%-
fe008|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
fe008|i agree.|s^aa
fe008|huh i totally agree.|s^aa^r
me013|uh.|b
fe008|it's just uh a question of uh if if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous then it seems like it's it's it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re listening to the meeting.|s^cs
fe008|because it becomes uh in a way a a uh a legal document.|s^df
fe008|if they've agreed to that.|s^e
me013|well i forget how we|s.%-
me013|right i forget how we ended up on this.|s
me013|but i remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything.|s
me013|and adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio.|s
me013|and i don't remember who won adam or me.|s^no
me013|but|fh
fe008|well if it's only the transcript though i mean this this is my point that that|s^ng.%-
me013|uh the|%-
me013|uh that's why i'm bringing this up again because i can't remember how we ended up.|s^df
fe008|then it becomes|s.%-
me013|that it was the|s.%--
me013|he wanted to do a web interface that would make it|s.%--
fe008|well if it's just the audio|s^ng.%--
me013|that would give you access to the transcript and the audio.|s^e
fe008|well.|fg
me013|that's what adam wanted.|s^bd
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|and i don't remember how we ended up.|s^no
fe016|i mean with the web interface it's interesting because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes.|s^cs
fe016|or something like that.|s^e
fe016|and i mean i would say no like i don't want to know.|s^bd:s
fe016|but some people might be really interested.|s
fe016|and then in other words they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that.|s
me013|you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were|s^j.%--
fe016|i don't know what happened to the small heads thing.|s^j^no
fe016|but i um i'm just saying that like you know you can sort of say that any things that are deemed|s^cs.%-
me013|they disappeared from view.|s^2^j
fe016|anyway i mean i agree that at some point people probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes.|fg|s^cs
fe016|and then they could be asked for their consent i guess if if those change.|s^cs
fe016|because assuming we we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway.|s^df
mn017|that's|%-
mn017|how about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts?|qo^cs
fe016|oh my god!|s^fe^nd
me013|uh|h
fe008|that would be simpler.|s^na
fe008|if we could count on them listening.|s^e
fe016|but no one will listen to the hours and hours of|s^ng.%-
me018|talk.|s^2
mn017|well that's okay.|s^bd
mn017|we just have to give them a chance to listen to it and if they don't that's their problem.|s^df
me001|that's|%-
me001|huh huh.|b
fe016|you you|%-
fe016|that's like|%-
fe008|unfortunately uh in in the thing that they signed it says transcripts.|s^ng
mn017|no i'm serious!|s^fe
fe008|you'll be you'll be provided the transcripts when they're available.|s^e:s
mn017|really?|qh^d^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|i i think|s.%-
me001|huh|b
mn017|huh|b
mn014|yeah.|b
fe016|that's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|anyway haven't we we've gone down this path a number of times i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere.|fg|s^df
me013|so let let me just suggest that uh off line that uh the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it's july.|s^co
fe008|yes.|s^aa
me013|okay so so that in july we can tell people yes we have this and you can use it.|s^bk|s^df:s
fe008|yes.|b
fe008|it's done ready available.|s^2
fe008|good.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|so let's see.|s^co^t^tc
me013|what else we got?|qo^t^tc
me013|uh don did did a report about his project in class.|fh|s^rt
me013|and uh an oral and written written version.|fh|s^e
fe016|well.|b^rt
me013|so that was stuff he was doing with you.|s^rt
fe016|i mean it's i guess one thing we're learning is that the amount|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|we have eight meetings there.|s
fe016|because we couldn't use the non native all non native meetings.|s^df
fe016|and it's well probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we're looking at.|s
fe016|because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them.|s^df
fe016|um so we're starting to see some patterns.|s
fe016|and we're hoping that maybe with i don't know double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so that we would start to get better results.|s
fe016|but we did find that some of the features that i jane would know about that are expressing sort of the distance of um boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local um range pitch range effects like how close people are to their floor are showing up in these classifiers.|s
fe016|which are also being given some word features that are cheating because they're true words.|s^e
fe016|um so these are based on forced alignment.|fh|s
fe016|word features like um word frequency.|s
fe016|and whether or not something's a backchannel and so forth.|s
fe016|so we're starting to see i think some interesting patterns.|s^ba
me013|so the dominant features including everything were those those quasi cheating things.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|where these are|s^e.%-
me001|sometimes not.|s^arp^rt
fe016|i think it depends what you're looking at actually.|s^am
me001|yeah sometimes positions in sentences obviously or in spurts was helpful.|fg|s
fe016|right.|b
me001|i don't know if that's cheating too.|s^no
fe016|um|h
mn017|spurts wouldn't be.|s^nd
mn017|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words.|s^na
fe016|but roughly speaking the recognized words are going to give you a similar type of position.|s^df
me001|right.|b
me001|right would they give you the same number of words though?|fg|qy^bu^rt
fe016|it's either early or late.|s^e
me013|right.|b
fe016|not exactly but|s^arp^rt|%-
me001|but somewhat?|qy^d^rt
fe016|yeah it should be.|s^am
me013|on the average.|s
fe016|well we don't know.|s^no
fe016|and actually that's one of the things we're interested in doing is a sort of|s.%-
mn017|have you tried using just time as opposed to number of words?|qy^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so|fh
me001|i think uh|s.%--
me001|just time position like when the word starts?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|well no i mean time time position relative to the beginning of the spurt.|s^ng
fe016|uh|b
me001|i don't know if that was in the|s^no.%-
fe016|you know|%-
me001|start.|s^2
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|uh we didn't try it.|s
me001|yeah there's all these things to do.|s
fe016|but it's|%-
me001|like there's a lot of different features you could just pull out.|s^e
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|i mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty well within the time.|s
me001|right.|s^aa
fe016|right.|s^aa
me013|how about time position normalized by|qh^cs.%-
fe016|and it depends on speaking rate.|s^2
me013|yeah yeah.|b
fe016|speaking rate yeah.|s^2^r
fe016|yeah that's actually why i didn't use it at first.|s^bd
me001|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|but we one of the interesting things was|s.%--
mn017|uhhuh.|b
fe016|i guess you reported on some punctuation type?|qy^bu^rt
fe016|finding sentence boundaries finding disfluency boundaries.|s^e
me001|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|and then i had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt.|s
fe016|so where you know if i'm talking now and someone and and andreas is about to interrupt me is he going to choose a certain place in my speech either prosodically or word based.|s^e:qy
fe016|and there the prosodic features actually showed up.|s
fe016|and a neat thing|s.%--
fe016|even though the word features were available.|s^e
fe016|and a neat thing there too is i tried some putting the speaker|s^r.%--
fe016|so i gave everybody a short version of their name.|s
fe016|so the real names are in there.|s
fe016|which we couldn't use.|s^e
fe016|uh we should use i d's or something.|fh|s^cs
fe016|and those don't show up.|s^e
fe016|so that means that overall um it wasn't just modeling morgan or it wasn't just modeling a single person.|s^bs
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|um|fh
fe016|but was sort of trying to uh get a general idea.|s
fe016|the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers.|s
fe016|even though there are huge speaker effects.|s^e
fe016|so|fh
fe016|the but the main limitation now is i because we're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words we need more more data and more data per speaker.|s^co
fe016|so|fh
fe016|it'd also be interesting to look at the e d u meetings.|s^ba^cs
fe016|because we did include meeting type as a feature.|s^df
fe016|so|fh
fe016|whether you were in a meeting recorder meeting or a robustness meeting did matter to interrupts.|s
fe016|because there are just fewer interrupts in the robustness meetings.|s^df
me001|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and so the classifier learns more about morgan than it does about sort of the average person.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|which is not bad.|s^ba
fe016|it'd probably do better than um but it wasn't generalizing.|s^df
fe016|so it's|%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|and i think don um well we have a long list of things he's starting to look at now over the summer.|s
fe016|where we can|%--
fe016|and he'll be able to report on more things in the future.|s
fe016|but it was great that we could at least go from the you know jane's transcripts and the uh recognizer output and get it to this point.|s^ba
fe016|and i think it's something mari can probably use in her preliminary report.|s^cs
fe016|like yeah we're at the point where we're training these classifiers.|s:s
fe016|and we're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features both word and prosodic work.|s
fe016|the other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard.|s^rt
fe016|and i think that really is from the close talking mikes.|s
fe016|because the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the switchboard telephone bandwidth.|s^df
mn017|better in what sense?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|um well first of all the pitch tracks are have less um halvings and doublings than than switchboard.|h|s^ba
fe016|and there's a lot less dropout.|s^rt
fe016|so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words.|s
fe016|for for you know five|s^e.%--
me013|huh.|b
fe016|there are much fewer than in switchboard.|s
fe016|so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard.|s
fe016|and so the features weren't as reliable.|s
fe016|because they were often just not available.|s^df
fe016|so that's actually good.|s
me018|could it have to do with the the lower frequency cut off on the switchboard?|qy^rt
fe016|maybe i mean the we had telephone bandwidth for switchboard.|s^am|s
fe016|and we had the annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that i think may also affect it.|s
me018|huh.|s^bk
fe016|so we're just getting better signals in in this data.|s^ba
fe016|which is nice.|s
fe016|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|anyway don's been doing a great job  .|s^tc|s^ba
fe016|and we hope to continue with um andreas's help and also some of thilo's help on this.|s
me013|great.|s^bk
fe016|to to try to get a non cheating version of how all this would work.|s^e
mn014|yeah sure.|s^aa
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|has has uh we just i think just talked about this the other day but has has anybody had a chance to try changing uh insertion penalty sort of things with the with the uh uh using the tandem system input for the|qy.%--
mn017|oh yeah i tried that.|s^bk|s
mn017|it didn't um help dramatically.|s
me018|were they out of balance?|qy^rt
mn017|the|%-
me018|i didn't i didn't notice.|s^no
mn017|there were a little|s.%--
mn017|the relative number of|s.%--
mn017|i think there were a higher number of deletions actually.|s
me013|oh.|s^bk
fe016|deletions?|qy^br^rt
mn017|so you uh so actually it it preferred to have a positive uh negative insertion penalty.|s
mn017|which means that um|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|but you know it didn't change the|s.%--
mn017|by adjusting that the um|s.%--
me013|okay.|b
mn017|yeah the error changed by probably one percent or so.|s
mn017|but you know given that that word error rate is so high that's not a|s.%-
me013|okay so that|s^bk|%-
me013|so that's so that's not the problem.|s^2
mn017|that's not the problem.|s^m^na
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|no.|s^aa
mn017|but uh we just um|s.%--
mn017|uh|fh
mn017|you know chuck and i talked and the next thing to do is probably to tune the um the size of the gaussian system um to to this to this feature vector which we haven't done at all.|s
mn017|we just used the same configuration as we used for the for the standard system.|s
me013|huh.|b
mn017|and for instance uh dan dan just sent me a message saying that c m u used um something like ten gaussians per cluster.|s
mn017|you know each each mixture has ten gaussians.|s
me018|uhhuh.|s^bk
me018|huh we're using sixty four.|s^bu
mn017|and and we're using sixty four.|s
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|so that's obviously a big difference.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|and it might be way off.|s^am
mn017|and give very poorly trained uh you know gaussians that way.|s^am
me013|huh.|b
mn017|uh and poorly trained mixture weights.|s^e
mn017|so so we have|s.%--
mn017|the turn around time on the training when we train only the a male system with uh you know our small training set is less than twenty four hours.|s
mn017|so we can run lots of uh basically just brute force.|s^cs
mn017|try a whole bunch of different um settings.|s^cs
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn017|and uh with the new machines it'll be even better.|s
mn017|so|fh
me013|yeah we get twelve of those.|fg|s
me013|huh?|qy^d^f^g
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|but the p l p features work um uh you know continue to improve the|s.%--
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn017|um|fh
mn017|as i said before the uh using dan's uh uh vocal tract normalization option works very well.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so um i ran one experiment where we're just did the vocal tract normalization only in the test data.|s
mn017|so i didn't bother to retrain the models at all.|s
mn017|and it improved by one percent.|s
mn017|which is about what we get with uh with you know just actually doing both training and test normalization um with um the uh uh with the standard system.|s
mn017|so in a few hours we'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization.|s
mn017|and so that might even improve it further.|s
me013|great.|b
mn017|so it looks like the p l p features do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|so|fh
fe016|wait so you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any v t l in it already?|qy^d^rt
me013|good.|b.%
mn017|exactly yeah.|s^aa
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|okay so then then we'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous uh uh new thing with.|fg|s
mn017|right|s^aa|%-
me013|but|%-
mn017|right and and what that suggests also is of course that the current switchboard m l p isn't trained on very good features.|fg|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|uh because it was trained on whatever you know was used uh last time you did hub five stuff.|s^df
mn017|which didn't have any of the|s.%-
me013|right but all of these effects were like a couple percent.|s^bk|s^df
mn017|uh|%-
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|i mean the|s.%-
mn017|well but if you add them all up you have uh almost five percent difference now.|s^df^ng
me013|add all of them|s^m^t1.%--
me013|i thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight.|s^ng
mn017|yeah and now we have another percent with the v t l.|s^aa|s^rt
me013|that's three point three.|s
mn017|um actually and it's|s.%--
mn017|right it was it was there was|s.%--
mn017|um|fh
mn017|what's actually interesting is that with|s.%--
mn017|um well you maybe another half percent if you do the v t l in training.|s
mn017|and then interestingly if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the um uh the n best lists.|s
mn017|uh and optimizing the weights.|s^e
mn017|um uh than|s.%-
me018|than you do with the standard?|qy^2^bu^d^rt
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah but the part that's actually adjustment of the front end per se as opposed to doing putting v t l n in or something is it was a couple percent.|s^bk|s
mn017|so|%-
mn017|right.|s^aa
me013|right it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight.|s
me013|so and and|%--
me013|let me see if i remember what they were.|s
me013|one of them was uh the change to uh because it did it all at once to uh from bark scale to mel scale.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|which i really feel like saying in quotes.|s^e
me013|because they're essentially the same scale.|s^df
fe016|yeah why did that|fg|qw.%-
me013|but the but but but any individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place.|s^df
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so that's why i wanted to look|s.%--
me013|i still haven't looked at it yet.|s
me013|i i want to look at exactly where the filters were in the two.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and it it's probably something like there's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band.|s^am
me013|and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|one way or the other.|s
fe016|huh.|b
me013|um it could be there's something more fundamental.|s^am^bd^cs
me013|but it you know i i don't know it yet.|s^bd^df^no
me013|and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something.|s
me013|and then there was point eight percent.|s
me013|which was|s.%--
me013|what was the other thing?|qw^t1
me018|well that was combined with the triangular.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|yeah those those two were together.|s^aa|s
me018|yeah right.|s^bk
me013|we weren't able to separate them out.|s
me013|because it was just done in one thing.|s^df
me013|but then there was a point eight percent which was something else.|s
me013|do you remember the|qy.%-
me018|the low frequency cut off.|s^na
me013|oh yeah so that was that was uh that one i can claim credit for uh in terms of screwing it up in the first place.|s^bk|s
me013|so that someone until someone else fixed it.|s^e
me013|which is that um i never put|s.%--
me013|when|%--
me013|we had some problems before with offsets.|s
me013|this this went back to uh i think wall street journal.|s
me013|so we we had uh|s.%--
mn017|huh.|b
me013|everybody else who was doing wall street knew that there were big d c offsets in in these data in those data.|s
me013|and and and nobody happened to mention it to us.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|and we were getting these like really terrible results.|s
me013|like two three times the error everybody else was getting.|s^rt
me013|and then in casual conversation someone mentioned uh well i guess you know of course you're taking care of the offsets.|s:s
me013|i said what offsets.|s:qw
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me001|uhhuh.|b
me013|and at that point you know we were pretty new to the data.|s
me013|and we'd never really like looked at it on a screen.|s
me013|and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop!|s^fe
me013|there's this big d c offset.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so um in p l|s.%-
fe016|there was a like a hum or or when they recorded it?|qy^d^rt
me013|no it's just it it's it's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different um d c offsets.|s^ar|s
fe016|or just|qrr.%-
fe016|huh.|s^bk
me013|it's it's you know no big deal.|s^ba
me013|it's you know you could have ten twenty maybe thirty millivolts whatever.|s
me013|and it's consistently in there.|s
me013|the thing is most people's front ends have pre emphasis with it with zero at zero frequency.|s
me013|so that it's irrelevant.|s
me013|uh but with p l p we didn't actually have that.|s
me013|we had we had the equivalent of pre emphasis in a a uh fletcher munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of p l p.|s
me013|but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency.|s
fe016|huh.|b
me013|like uh uh typical simple pre emphasis does.|s^e
me013|we had something more fancy.|s
me013|it was later on.|s
me013|it didn't have that.|s
me013|so at that point i oh we better have a have a high pass filter.|s:s
me013|just you know just take care of the problem.|s
me013|so i put in a high pass filter at uh i think ninety ninety hertz or so uh for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate.|s
me013|and i never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates.|s
me013|and so well so you know the code doesn't know anything about that.|s
me013|and so this is all at eight kilohertz.|s
me013|and so it was at forty five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|so um|fh
me013|i don't know if dan fixed it or or uh what he|s.%-
mn017|well he made it a parameter.|s
me013|he made it a parameter.|s^m^na
me013|so yeah i guess if he did it right he did fix it.|s
me013|and then and then it's taking care of sampling rate.|s
me013|which is great.|s
me018|what what is the parameter?|qw
me013|he had a|s.%-
me018|is it uh just the lower cut off that you want?|qy^rt
mn017|it's called uh h h. p. f.|s^rt
me013|h|%--
me013|yeah does h. p. f on on his feature.|s^aa|s
mn017|and but h. p. f you know when you put a number after it uses that as the hertz value of the cut off.|s^bd
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
mn017|so|fh
me013|i mean frankly we never did that with the rasta filter either.|s
me013|so the rasta filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you're doing.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|which is another old old bug of mine.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but um|fh
me013|um so that that was the problem there was we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and it just wasn't doing it.|s
me013|so now it is.|s
me013|so that that helped us by like eight tenths of a percent.|s
me013|it still wasn't a big deal.|s
mn017|okay.|b
mn017|well but um well uh again after completing the current experiments we'll we can add up all the uh differences.|s
me013|oh yeah.|s^aap
me013|but but i guess my my point was that that um the hybrid system thing that we did was uh primitive in many ways.|s^df
mn017|and and|%-
mn017|right.|s^bk
me013|and i think i agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up we would probably have a a a competitive system.|s
me013|but i think not that much of it is due to the front end per se.|s^bd^df
me013|i think maybe a couple percent of it is as far as i can see from this.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh unless you call well if you call v t l the front en front end that's uh a little more.|s^bd
me013|but that's sort of more both kind of.|s^bd
me018|one experiment we should we'll probably need to do though when um at some point is since we're using that same the net that was trained on p l p without all these things in it for the tandem system we may want to go back and retrain.|s^cs
me013|right.|s^f
me013|but|fh
mn017|well that's what i meant in fact yeah.|s^na|s^aa
me018|yeah yeah.|s^bk
me018|for the tandem you know.|s^e|s^f
me018|so we can see if it what effect it has on the tandem processing.|s
mn017|so so the thing is is do we expect|fg|qy.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uh at this point i'm i mean you know i'm wondering is it can we expect uh a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know a gaussian system trained directly on the features with you know the right choice of parameters?|qy^rt
me013|well that's what we're seeing in other areas yes.|s^na|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|so it's so|%--
me013|um um|fh
me018|so we but but we may not i mean if it doesn't perform as well we may not know why.|s
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|because we need to do the exact experiment.|s^df
mn017|right.|s^aa
me013|i mean the reason to think it should is because you're putting in the same information and you're transforming it to be more discriminative.|s
me013|so um|fh
me013|now the thing is in some databases i wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much.|s
me013|and and part of what i view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do.|s^e
me013|not just the standard front end.|s^e
me013|but other things like with multiple streams and so forth.|s^e
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel.|s^e
me013|um so i think i think that's the real power of it.|s
me013|i wouldn't expect huge huge improvements.|s
me013|um but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|if it's you know like way way worse then you know|s.%--
mn017|right.|s^bk
me018|so morgan another thing that andreas and i were talking about was|fg|s.%--
me018|so in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty six uh outputs.|s
me018|and that's um basically compared to a thirty nine input feature vector from either m f c c or p l p.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me018|but one thing we could do is|s.%-
me013|let let let me just ask you something.|s
me013|when you say take the fifty six outputs these are the final nonlinearity outputs?|qy^bu^d
me018|yeah through the regular tandem outputs.|s^aa|s^na
me013|and they're and|%-
me013|through the k l t?|qy^bu^d^e
me018|through the k l t.|s^m^na
me013|okay.|s^bk
me018|all that kind of stuff.|s^e
me013|and so so then you do you use all fifty six of the k l t?|qy^bu^rt
me013|or|qrr.%--
me018|that's what we did.|s^na
me018|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|okay.|s^bk
me018|so one thing we were wondering is if we did principal components and say took out just thirteen and then did deltas and double deltas on that|s.%--
me013|yes.|b
me013|yes.|b
me018|so we treated the first thirteen as though they were standard features.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|i mean did dan do experiments like that to|qy.%--
me013|uh talk with stephane.|s^co
me013|he did some things like that.|s^df
me013|it was either him or carmen.|s^bd^df
me013|i forget.|s^no
me018|huh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|s^bk
me013|i mean these were all different databases and different you know in h t k and all that.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|so it it may not apply.|s
me013|but my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse.|s^rt
me018|huh.|b
me013|but again given all these differences maybe it's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low variance uh components.|s
me018|because in a sense the net's already got quite a bit of context in those features.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
me018|so if we did deltas and double deltas on top of those we're getting sort of even more.|s
me013|which could be good or not.|s^2
me018|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah worth trying.|fg|s^cs
mn017|but there the main point is that um you know it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now.|s
mn017|and i mean there's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we're feeding the tandem features.|s
mn017|uh either generating them or feeding them to this to the s r i system.|s^e
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|but|%-
me013|there might be.|s^am
mn017|it's|%-
me013|because that's a pretty big difference.|s^ba^df
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
me013|but|fh
mn017|and i'm wondering how we can how we can debug that.|s
me018|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|i mean how|s.%--
mn017|um|fh
me013|huh.|b
mn017|i'm actually quite sure that the feeding the features into the system and training it up.|s
me013|what if|%-
mn017|that that i think that's this that's essentially the same as we use with the with the p l p features.|s
mn017|and that's obviously working great.|s
mn017|so um|%-
me018|yeah there could be a bug in in the somewhere before that.|fg|s
mn017|there we could|%-
mn017|the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the k l t transform?|qh
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|that's|%-
mn017|right?|qy^d^f^g
mn017|we|%-
me018|right.|s^aa
me013|well and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|these nets are trained with particular normalization.|s
me013|and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it.|s
me018|i'm doing what eric|s.%--
me018|eric coached me through then that part of it.|s^df
me018|so i'm pretty confident in that.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me018|i mean the only slight difference is that i use normalization values that um andreas calculated.|s
me018|from the original p l p.|s^e
mn017|right.|s^bk
me018|which is right.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|b
me018|so i i do|fh|s.%--
me018|oh we actually don't do that normalization for the p l p.|s^bu
me018|do we?|qy^g^rt
me018|for the just the straight p l p features.|s^e
mn017|no the the s r i system does it.|s^ar|s
me018|s r i system does that right.|s^bk^m|s^bk
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me013|right.|b
me013|well you might|s.%-
me018|so that's that's another|s.%-
mn017|so there's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah i i would actually double check with stephane at this point.|fg|s^cs
mn017|but|fh
me013|because he's probably the one here|s^df.%--
me013|i mean he and dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not not being handled right.|s
me018|yeah it's hard with features.|fg|s
me018|because you don't know what they should look like.|s^df
me018|i mean you can't just like print the the values out in ascii and you know look at them see if they're|s^df^e.%-
me013|not unless you had a lot of time.|s^arp^j
fe016|well|fg
me013|and|%-
fe016|uh and also they're not i mean as i understand it you you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error.|s^bu
fe016|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|right.|s^aa
fe016|i mean these are just discriminative.|s^bd
fe016|but they're not um optimized for the final|s.%-
mn017|they're optimized for phone discrimination.|s^nd
fe016|right so it there's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word error metric that you're actually that you're actually|s^bk|s.%-
mn017|not for|s^e.%-
me013|that's right.|s^aa
me013|well the other|s.%-
me013|yeah the|fg|%-
mn017|huh|%-
me013|well you actually are.|s^nd
me013|but but it but in an indirect way.|s^e
fe016|well right it's indirect so you don't know|s^aa|s^df.%-
me013|so what and you may not be in this case.|s
me013|come to think of it.|s
me013|because uh you're just taking something that's trained up elsewhere.|s^df
me013|so what what you what you do in the full procedure is you um uh have an embedded training.|s
me013|so in fact you the the net is trained on uh uh a uh viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system.|s
me013|and so that's where the feedback comes all around so that it is actually discriminant.|s
me013|you can prove that it's it's a|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|if you believe in the viterbi assumption that uh getting the best path uh is almost equivalent to getting the best uh total probability um then you actually do improve that by uh by training up on local local uh local frames.|s
me013|but um we aren't actually doing that here.|s
me013|because we did we did that for a hybrid system.|s^df
me013|and now we're plugging it into another system.|s^df^e
me013|and so it isn't it wouldn't quite apply here.|s
me018|so another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features uh do s r i forced alignments using those features and then re do the net with those.|s^cs
mn017|do|%-
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|huh uh exactly exactly.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so that you can optimize it for the word error.|s^df
me013|yeah another thing is since you're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation it's probably bigger than it needs to be.|fg|s
mn017|but|%-
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|so that would save a lot of time.|s
mn017|and there's a mismatch in the phone sets.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn017|so you're using a a a larger phone set than what|s.%-
me013|yeah actually all those things could could could could uh could affect it as well.|s^aa|s^am
me018|yeah yeah.|b
me013|the other thing uh just to mention that stephane this was an innovation of stephane's which was a pretty neat one.|s
me013|uh and might particularly apply here given all these things we're mentioning.|s
me013|um stephane's idea was that um discriminant uh approaches are great.|s
me013|even the local ones given you know these potential outer loops which you know you can convince yourself turn into the global ones.|s
me013|um however there's times when it is not good.|s
me013|uh when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that uh the discrimination that you're learning is is is not a good one.|s^e
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so uh his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the uh gaussian mixture system uh a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features.|s
mn017|oh we already talked about that.|s^bk|s
fe016|yeah that|fg|%-
me013|yeah.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|didn't you did you do that already?|qy^rt
mn017|yeah.|b
fe016|or|qrr.%-
mn017|no but we we when when we when i first started corresponding with dan about how to go about this i think that was one of the things that we definitely went there.|s^ar|s
fe016|oh that makes a lot of sense.|s^bk|s^cs
fe016|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah i mean i'm sure that stephane wasn't the first to think of it.|fg|s^bd
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|but actually stephane did it.|s^df
me013|and and and it helped a lot.|s
mn017|uhhuh and does it help?|s^bk|qy^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|so that's that that's our current best best system in the uh uh in the aurora thing.|s
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
fe016|yeah that makes sense.|fg|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and do you do a k l t transform on the on the combined feature vector?|qy^rt
fe016|as you should never do worse.|s
me013|i i uh missed what you said.|s^br
mn017|do you you do a k l t transform on the combined feature vector?|qy^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me013|well actually i uh you should check with him.|s^bd
me013|because he tried several different combinations.|s^df
mn017|because you end up with this huge feature vector so that might be a problem unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction.|s^df
me013|yeah i uh|s^bk|%-
me013|what i don't remember is which came out best.|s^no
me013|so he did one where he put put the whole thing into one k l t.|s
me013|and another one since the the p l p things are already orthogonalized he left them alone and and just did a k l t on the on the on the net outputs.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and then concatenated that.|s^e
mn017|huh.|b
me013|and i don't remember which was better.|s^no
me018|did he did he try to|qy.%--
me018|so he always ended up with a feature vector that was twice as long as either one of the|qy^bu^d.%-
me013|no i don't know i i don't know.|s^ar|s^no
me013|you have to check with him.|s^cs
me018|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|okay actually i have to run.|fg|s^tc
me013|i'm into big ideas these days.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|uh|fh
fe016|we need to close up.|s^tc
fe016|because i need to save the data and um get a call.|s^df
me013|not to mention the fact that we're missing snacks.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|right.|s^bk
fe016|did people want to do the digits?|qy^rt
me013|uh|%-
fe016|or um do them together?|qrr
me013|um|h
me013|i i i think given that we're in a hurry for snacks maybe we should do them together.|s^cs
fe016|i don't know.|s^bd^no
fe016|should we just|qy.%-
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe016|i mean are we trying to do them in synchrony?|qy^rt
fe016|that might be fun.|s^cs
fe016|adam's not here so he's not here to tell me no.|s^df.x
me013|well it's it's it's not you know it's not going to work out.|s^nd
me013|but we could we could just uh uh see if we find a rhythm.|s^cs
me013|you know.|s^f
fe016|sure.|s^bk^rt
me013|what|%--
me013|uh o s or zeroes?|qr
me013|we want to agree on that?|qy^d^rt
fe016|maybe just whatever people would naturally do.|s^cs^ng
fe016|i don't know.|s^bd^no
me013|oh but if we were a singing group we would want to decide.|s^cs^ng
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|be harmony.|s^ba^j
fe016|yeah yeah.|b
fe008|mine's identical to yours.|s^bu
me013|we might|%-
fe008|is that correct?|qy^g^rt
fe016|sorry so i set up.|s^fa|s
fe016|and we didn't have enough digit forms.|s^df^e
fe008|oh i see.|s^bk
fe016|so i xeroxed the same one seven times.|s^e
me013|so these are excellent.|s^ba
fe008|oh i see.|s^bk
me013|why don't we do|qh^cs.%-
me013|anyone have a problem with saying zero?|qo^rt
fe016|no.|s^ar
me013|is zero okay?|qy^rt
fe008|yeah.|b.%
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|one and a two and three.|s
me013|once more with feeling.|z
fe016|and|z
me013|no just just kidding.|z
me013|oh yeah it was.|z
me022|yeah.|z
me013|um so|fh
me013|if we can't we can't but uh we're going to try to make this an abbreviated meeting.|s^t
me013|because the the next next occupants were pushing for it.|s^df
me013|so|fh
me013|um.|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|agenda is according to this is transcription status darpa demos x m l tools disks backups et cetera and crosspads.|s^t
me011|does anyone have anything to add to the agenda?|qy^rt^t
me013|okay.|s^bk^rt
me013|should we just go in order?|qy^rt^t
me013|transcription status.|s^e^rt
me013|who's that's probably you.|s
fe008|i can do that quickly.|s^na
fe008|um i hired several more transcribers.|s^rt
fe008|they're making great progress.|s
me013|seven?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|several several.|s^bc^nd
me013|oh.|s^bk
fe008|and uh|fh
fe008|and uh|fh
fe008|uh i've been uh finishing up the uh double checking.|s
fe008|i hoped to have had that done by today.|s
fe008|but it's going to take one more week.|s
me011|um|fg
me011|as a somewhat segue into the next topic um could i get a hold of uh the data even if it's not really corrected yet?|qy^rt
mn014|i|%-
me011|just so i can get the data formats.|s^df^e
me011|and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working.|s^df^e
fe008|certainly.|s^aa
fe008|yeah i mean it's in the same place it's been.|s
me011|so can you just|qy.%-
me011|oh it is?|qh^rt
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe008|uhhuh no change.|s^aa
me011|just so transcripts is the sub directory?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|uh yes uhhuh.|h|s^aa^rt
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|so i'll i'll probably just make some copies of those.|s^cc
me011|rather than use the ones that are there.|s^e
fe008|okay.|s^bk^rt
me011|um and then just we'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made.|fh|s^co
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay|fg|%-
mn014|i also got a short remark to the transcription.|s
mn014|i've uh just processed the first five e d u meetings.|s
mn014|and they are chunked up.|s
mn014|so they would they probably can be sent to i b m.|s^rt
mn014|whenever they want them.|s^e^rt
me018|well the second one of those|s.%-
me001|cool.|s^bk
mn014|yep it's already at i b m.|s^aa|s^2
me018|is already at i b m.|s^m
mn014|but the other ones|s.%-
me018|that's the one that we're waiting to hear from them on.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
fe008|okay.|b
fe008|these are separate from the ones that|s^bu.%-
me018|as soon as|s.%-
fe008|i mean these are|s.%-
me018|they're the i b m set.|s
me011|it's this one.|s.%
mn014|yep.|s^aa
fe008|excellent.|b
me018|yeah.|b
fe008|good.|b
me011|is my mike on?|qy^rt^t1
me018|and so as soon as we hear from brian that this one is okay.|s^rt
me011|yeah.|b
me018|and we get the transcript back.|s
me018|and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them.|s
me018|then uh we'll be ready to go and we'll just send them the next four as a big batch.|s^cc
fe008|excellent.|b
me018|and let them work on that.|s
me011|and so we're doing those as disjoint from the ones we're transcribing here?|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|yes.|s^aa
me011|okay good.|s^bk
me018|exactly.|s^aa
me018|we're sort of doing things in parallel.|s
me018|that way we can get as much done at once.|s^df
me011|yeah i think that's the right way to do it.|s^na
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me011|especially for the information retrieval stuff.|s^e
me011|anything else on transcription status?|qy^d^rt^t
fe008|hm-huh.|s^ar
me011|okay.|s^bk^rt
me013|darpa demos.|s^rt^t
me013|we had the submeeting the other day.|s^e^rt
me011|right which uh|fg|%--
me011|so i've been working on using the thisl tools to do information retrieval on meeting data.|s
me011|and the thisl tools are there're two sets there's a back end and a front end.|s
me011|so the front end is the user interface.|s
me011|and the back end is the indexing tool and the querying tool.|s
me011|and so i've written some tools to convert everything into the right file formats.|s
me011|and the command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working.|s
me011|so at least on the one meeting that i had the transcript for uh conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it.|s
me011|do type in a a string and get back a list of start end times for the meeting.|s^e
me011|uh of hits.|s^e
me018|what what kind of uh what does that look like the string that you type in?|qw
me018|what are you are you are they keywords or are they|qr.%--
me011|keywords.|s^aa^m
me018|okay.|s^bk
me018|i see.|s^bk
me011|right and so and then it munges it to pass it to the thisl i r which uses an s g m l like format for everything.|s
me018|i see.|s^bk
me013|and then does it play something back?|qy^rt
me013|or that's something you're having to program?|qr
me011|um right now i have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools.|s^na
me013|yeah.|b
me011|but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either|s.%--
me011|so so that's the other thing i wanted to discuss is well what should we do for the user interface.|s^cs^t:qw
me011|we have two tools that have already been written.|s
me011|um the softsound guys did a web based one.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|um which i haven't used haven't looked at.|fh|s
me011|dan says it's pretty good.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|but it does mean you need to be running a web server.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|and so it it's pretty big and complex.|s
me011|uh and it would be difficult to port to windows.|fh|s
me011|because it means porting the web server to windows.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|uh the other option is dan did the tcl t k thisl gui front end for broadcast news.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|which i think looks great.|s^ba
me011|i think that's a nice demo.|s^ba
me011|um and that would be much easier to port to windows.|s
me011|and so i think that's the way we should go.|s^cs
fe008|i can i ask a question?|qy
me011|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe008|so um as it stands within the the channeltrans interface it's possible to do a find and a play.|fh|s:s
fe008|you can find a searched string and play.|s
fe008|so are you so you're adding like um i don't know uh are they fuzzy matches or are they uh|qo^bu.%-
me011|it's a sort of standard text-retrieval-based.|s
me011|so it's uh term frequency inverse document frequency scoring.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk^rt
me011|um and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing.|fh|s
me011|how far apart they have to be and things like that.|s^e
me011|so it it's|s.%-
fe008|it's a lot more sophisticated than the uh the basically windows based.|s^bu
me011|it's like doing a google query or anything else like that.|s^na
me011|so it uses so it produces an index ahead of time.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk^rt
me011|so you don't you're not doing a linear search through all the documents.|s
me011|because you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours' worth you do wouldn't want to do a search.|s
fe008|hm-huh.|s^aa
me011|um you have to do preindexing.|s
fe008|good.|b
me011|and so that these tools do all that.|s
me011|and so the work to get the front end to work would be porting it|s.%--
me011|well uh to get it to work on the unix systems our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings.|fh|s
me011|so that it understands that they're different speakers and that it's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sort of things like that.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me018|so what does the user see as the result of the query?|qw
me011|on which tool?|qw^bu
me018|thisl.|s
me011|the thisl gui tool which is the one that dan wrote tcl t k.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|um you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits.|fh|s
me011|and you can type on them and listen to them.|s
me011|click on them rather with a mouse.|s^bsc
me018|uh.|s^bk
me018|so if you typed in small heads or something you could|qy^bu.%--:s
me013|huh.|b
me011|right you'd get|s^aa|%-
me018|get back a uh uh something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred.|s^2
me011|something|s.%-
me011|you you'd get to listen to beep.|s:s^j
me018|or|%-
me013|that was a really good look.|s^ba^j
me013|it's too bad that that couldn't come into the|s^ba.%-
me011|you couldn't get a video.|s^j
fe016|guess who i practice on.|s^co
fe008|at some point we're going to have to say what that private joke is.|s
fe008|that keeps coming up.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|and then again maybe not.|s^ar
me013|so uh|fh
me013|yeah that that sounds reasonable.|s
me013|yeah it it my my recollection of it is it's it's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
me018|yeah that sounds good.|s^ba
me011|and so i think there'd be minimal effort to get it to work minimally.|s
me018|that sounds really neat.|s^ba
me011|and then we'd want to add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff.|s^cs:s
me011|um dave gelbart expressed some interest in working on that.|s
me011|so i'll work with him on it.|s^cc
me011|and it it's looking pretty good.|s
me011|you know the fact that i got the query system working.|s^e
me011|so if we want to just do a video based one i think that'll be easy.|s^ba^cs
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|if we want to get it to windows it's going to be a little more work.|s
me011|because the thisl i r the information retrieval tool's um|s^df.%--
me011|i had difficulty just compiling them on solaris.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|so getting them to compile on windows might be challenging.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me018|but you were saying that that the uh that there's that set of tools uh cygnus tools that|s.%-
me011|so|fh
me011|it certainly helps.|s^na
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|um i mean without those i wouldn't even attempt it.|s
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|but what those they what those do is provide sort of a b s d compatibility layer.|s
me011|so that the normal unix function calls all work.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|um|fh
me018|and you have to have all the|s^bu.%-
me011|but the problem is that that the thisl tools didn't use anything like autoconf.|s
me011|and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and some things are defined and some things aren't.|s
me011|and uh different compiler work arounds and so on.|s
me011|so the fact that um it took me a day to get it to compile under solaris means it's probably going to take me significantly more than that to get it to compile under windows.|s
me013|how about having it run under free b s d?|qo^cs
me022|well what you need|s.%-
me011|free b s d would probably be easier.|s^ba^na
me022|all you need to do is say to dan gee it would be nice if this worked under autoconf and it'll be done in a day.|s:s
me011|that's true.|s^aa
me022|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn014|uh|b
me011|actually you know i should check.|s^cc
me011|because he did port it to sprachcore.|s^df
me022|right.|s^aa
me011|so he might have done that already.|s
me022|i i i wouldn't be surprised.|s
me013|so|fg
me011|i'll check at that.|s^cc
me018|how does it play?|qw
me022|what i|s.%-
me013|but it would what would serve would serve both purposes is if you contact him and ask him if he's already done it.|s^co
me011|yeah right.|s^aa
me013|if he has then you learn.|s
me013|if he hasn't then he'll do it.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
fe008|wow.|b
me018|i hope he never listens to these meetings.|s^j
me011|that's right.|s^aa.%
me011|so and i've been corresponding with dan and also with uh uh softsound guy uh|fg|s.%--
fe008|it's amazing.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|blanking on his name.|s
me018|tony robinson?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|tony robinson?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|do i mean tony?|qy^no^rt
me011|i guess i do.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
me011|or or steve renals.|s^e
me022|james christie.|s
me011|which one do i mean?|qw
me013|steve steve renals.|s
me022|steve renals is not softsound.|s^nd
me022|is he?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|no.|s^ar
me011|my brain is not working.|s^bd
me011|i don't remember who i've been corresponding with.|s^no
me013|okay.|s^bk
me022|steve it's steve renals wrote thisl i r.|s
me011|then it's steve renals.|s
me022|okay.|s^bk
me013|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|so uh just getting documentation and uh and and formats.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so that's all going pretty well.|s^ba
me011|i think we'll be okay with that.|s
me022|right.|b
me013|assuming we're|s.%-
me018|what about issues of playing sound files between the two platforms?|qo
me011|um|h
me011|we have|s.%--
me011|well that's a good point too.|s^ba
me022|here's a here's a crazy idea actually.|s
me011|i don't know.|s^no
me022|why don't you try and merge transcriber and thisl i r?|qh^cs
me011|well this is one of the reasons|s.%-
me022|they're both tcl interfaces.|s^df
me011|this is the one of the reasons that i'm going to have uh dave gelbart gelbart.|s^r
me011|having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing.|s^ba
me011|because he's worked on the transcriber stuff.|s^df
me022|right.|s^aa
me011|and he's more familiar with tcl t k than i am.|s^df
me022|and then you get they then you get the windows media playing for free.|s
me011|well that's snack not not transcriber.|s^ng
me022|right but the point is that the transcriber uses snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality.|s^aa|s^df
me011|yeah yeah i mean i i think thisl thisl gui probably uses snack.|s^aa|s
me022|and it's|%-
me011|and so my intention was just to base it on that.|s
me022|yeah.|s^bk
me022|well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts um uh you know from speaker to speaker.|s^cs
me011|and if it doesn't|s.%-
me022|right?|qy^d^g
me022|do you have you have you know a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here?|qy^rt
me011|right we'll have to figure out a user interface for that so.|s^bk|s^cc
me022|right well that uh my thought was if you had like multitrans or whatever do it.|fg|s^cs
me022|or whatever.|s^e
me011|yeah.|s^am
me011|it might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we'd be talking about.|s
me011|and having the search tools and so on.|s^e
me011|we we can look into it.|s^cc
me011|but|fh
me022|yeah.|b
me013|the thing i was asking about with um free b s d is that it might be easier to|s.%--
me013|get powerpoint shows running in free b s d than to get this other package running in|s.%--
me011|yeah i mean we have to i have to sit down and try it before i make too many judgments.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so uh|fh
me011|um|fh
me011|my experience with the gnu compatibility library is really it's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system.|s
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|the windows system isn't any harder.|s
me011|because it it looks like a b s d system.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|it's just you know just like all of them the include files are a little different and the function calls are a little different.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|so i it might be a little easier.|s
me011|but it's not going to be a lot easier.|s^e
me013|okay.|b
me013|so there was that demo which was one of the main ones.|s^tc
me013|and then we talked about um some other stuff.|s
me013|which would basically be um showing off the the transcriber interface itself.|s
me013|and as you say maybe we could even merge those in some sense.|s^cs
me013|but but um|fh
me013|uh and part of that was showing off what the speech non uh nonspeech stuff that thilo has done looks like.|fh|s
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|can i ask one more thing about thisl?|qy
me011|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
fe008|so with the i r stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um|qy^bu^d^rt.%-
me011|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
me011|ranked.|s^2
fe008|excellent.|s^bk
fe008|excellent.|s^bk^r
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|so another idea i had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to to show some of the prosody uh work that don's been doing.|s^cs
me013|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe016|um actually show some of the features.|fh|s^cs^e
fe016|and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries.|s^cs^e
fe016|um|fh
fe016|you know you can show that graphically sort of what the features are doing.|s^cs
fe016|it you know it doesn't work great but it's definitely giving us something.|s
me013|well i think it|s.%-
fe016|i don't know if that would be of interest or not.|s^no
me013|at the very least we're going to want something illustrative with that.|s^na
me013|because i'm going to want to talk about it.|s^df
me013|and so if there's something that shows it graphically it's much better than me just having a bullet point.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|pointing at something i don't know much about.|s^e
fe016|i mean you're looking at this now.|s
me013|so|fh
fe016|are you looking at waves or matlab?|qr^rt
me001|um yeah i'm starting to.|h|s
me001|and|fh
me001|um|fh
me001|yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on.|s^cc
fe016|yeah|s^aa.%-
me013|so when we here were having this demo meeting what we're sort of coming up with is that we want to have all these pieces together to first order by the end of the month.|s
me013|and then that'll give us a week or so.|s
fe016|oh the end of this month or next month?|qr^bu
me001|ooo the end of|s.%-
me011|this month.|s
fe016|oh you mean like today?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|oh.|s^bk
me011|oh sorry next month.|s^fa|s^bsc
me013|june june june.|s
fe016|next month.|s^bk^m
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|sorry.|s^fa
me011|today isn't june first.|s
me018|there's another one.|s
me011|is it?|qy^d^g
me022|exactly.|b
me013|uh that'll that'll give us that'll give us a week or so to uh to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works.|fg|s
fe016|sorry.|s^fa^r
fe016|i think i mean uh where|s.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me001|yeah i mean i'll be here.|s^bk|s
fe016|yeah if if don can sort of talk to whoever's|s^cs.%--
fe016|because we're doing this anyway as part of our you know the research.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|visualizing what these features are doing.|s^e
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|and so either|s.%--
fe016|it might not be integrated.|s
fe016|but it it could potentially be in it.|s
fe016|could find some.|s
me013|yeah well this is to an audience of researchers.|s
me013|so i mean you know|%--
me013|to let the goal is to let them know what it is we're doing.|s
fe016|i mean it's different.|s
me013|so that's|%-
fe016|i don't think anyone has done this on meeting data.|s
fe016|so it might be neat you know.|s^ba
me013|yeah.|b
me013|good.|b
me013|done with that.|s^rt^t^tc
me013|x m l tools?|qy^d^rt^t^tc
me011|um|fh
me011|so i've been doing a bunch of x m l tools.|s
me011|where you we're sort of moving to x m l as the general format for everything.|s
me011|and i think that's definitely the right way to go.|s^ba
me011|because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of x m l tools.|s^df
me011|um|fh
me011|so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in x m l.|s^cs
me011|because i'm not particularly happy with what we have now.|s^df
me011|i mean it works with transcriber.|s
me011|but it it's a pain to use it in other tools.|s
me011|uh because it doesn't mark start and end.|s^df
me018|start and end of each|qy^d.%--
me011|uh|h
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|utterance.|s^2
me018|utterance.|s^2^bk
me018|just marks?|qy^bu^d
me011|so it's implicit in in there.|s
me011|but you have to do a lot of processing to get it.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me018|right.|s^aa
me018|right.|s^aa^r
me011|and so and also i'd like to do the indirect time line business.|s^cs
me011|um but regardless i mean that's something that you me and jane can talk about later.|s
me011|um but i've installed x m l tools of various sorts in various languages.|fh|s
me011|and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files.|s
me011|either uh information on users because the user database is that way.|s^e
me011|i'm converting the key files to x m l so that you can extract uh various uh sorted information on individual meetings.|s^e
me001|cool.|s^ba
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|and then also the transcripts.|s^e
me011|and so just let me know there.|s^co
me011|it's mostly java and perl.|s
me011|but we can get other languages too if if that's desirable.|s^cs
fe016|oh quick question on that is do we have the the seat information?|qy^rt
fe016|in in the key files now?|qy^e^rt
fe008|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
me011|the seat information is on the key files for the ones which|s^aap.%-
fe008|uh|b
fe016|oh in|s^bk.%-
me011|it's been recorded.|s
fe016|for the new one.|s^2
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me013|seat?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe016|great.|s^ba
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|where where you're sitting.|s
me013|oh not not the quality or anything no.|s^bk|s
me011|right.|s^aa
me013|okay i see.|s^bk
me011|it's pretty soft and squishy.|s^ba^j
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|all right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me011|oh but that might just be me.|s^j
fe016|okay.|b
me011|um|fh
fe016|all right.|b
me013|that's more seat information than we wanted.|s^j
fe016|never mind.|s^bd
me022|huh|b
fe016|i'm just trying to figure out you know when morgan's voice appears on someone's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him.|s:qr^rt
me011|maybe we should bleep that out.|s^cs^j
me013|yeah.|b
me013|huh yeah.|b
me018|wait a minute.|s^co
me011|right.|s^aa
me018|how how uh where is it in the key file?|qw^rt
me013|yeah.|b
me011|the square bracket.|s^rt
fe016|because i mean i haven't been putting it in.|s
fe016|and in by|s.%-
me011|you haven't been putting it in.|s^bu
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|i have not.|s^r
fe008|well|%-
me011|oh okay.|s^bk
fe008|isn't it always on the digits?|qy^bu^rt
fe016|and|fh
me013|some of these are missing.|s^bu
me013|aren't they?|qy^rt
fe008|isn't it always on the digits forms?|qy^bu^r^rt
me013|some fall out of|s^t1.%-
fe016|well|%-
me011|yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have.|s^aa|s^cs
me001|ooo.|b
fe016|i mean they're on right these.|s
fe016|but i just hadn't ever been putting it in the key files.|s
me018|yeah i i never|s.%-
fe016|and i don't think chuck was either.|s
me018|i never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file.|s
fe016|because|%-
me011|i had told you guys about it.|s
fe016|oh so we're both sorry.|s^bk|s^fa
me011|but|fh
me018|oh really?|qh^rt
fe016|so|fh
me011|i mean this is why i want to use a a tool to do it rather than the plain text.|s^df
fe016|okay.|b
me011|because with the plain text it's very easy to skip those things.|s^df
me018|okay.|s^bk
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|so|fh
me011|um if you use the edit key|s.%--
me011|or key edit.|s^bsc^rt
me011|i think it's edit key command.|s^rt
mn014|edit key.|s^aa^m
me011|did i show you guys that?|qy^rt
mn014|yep.|s^aa
me011|i did show it to you.|s
me018|you mentioned it.|s^na
me011|but i think you both said no you'll just use text file.|s:s
me018|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me018|text.|s^2
me011|um it has it in there a place to fill it in.|fh|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me018|okay.|s^bk
me011|yeah and so if you don't fill it in you're not going to get it in the meetings.|s
fe016|so if|%-
me011|so|fh
fe016|right well i i just realized i hadn't been doing it.|s^df
me011|yep.|b
fe016|and probably so|%--
me011|yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is on the microphone.|s^rt
me011|on channel zero it says hand held mike or crown mike.|s^rt:s
fe016|yeah.|b
fe016|right.|s^aa
me011|you actually have to say which one.|s^co
fe016|i know.|s^aa
fe016|yeah i usually delete the|s.%--
me011|so|fh
fe016|i don't|%-
me018|oh okay i didn't do that either.|s^bk|s
fe016|maybe i forgot to|s.%-
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|takes me no time at all to edit these.|s
fe016|but it's almost|s.%-
fe016|yeah.|fg
me011|yeah that's because you|s.%-
me018|i'm not doing anything.|s^2^j
me011|i i know why.|s
fe016|and i was i was looking at chuck's like oh what did chuck do.|s:qw
fe016|okay i'll do that.|s:s^cc
fe016|so|fh
me011|and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under participants they were filled in under description.|s:s
me013|uh okay.|s^bk
fe016|uh|fg
me011|and so that's also a problem.|s
me011|so anyway.|s^tc
fe016|we will do better.|s^cc
me011|that's it.|s^tc
me011|oh uh also i'm working on another version of this tool.|fg|s^rt
me011|the the one that shows up here that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected.|s^e
me011|and it's not quite ready to go yet.|s
me011|because um it's hard to tell whether the mike's connected or not.|s
me011|because the best quality ones the crown ones are about the same level if they're off.|s^rt
me011|and no one's off or if they're on and no one's talking.|s^e
me001|huh.|b
me011|um these these ones they are much easier.|s
me011|there's a bigger difference.|s^df
me011|so i'm working on that.|s
me011|and it it sort of works.|s
me011|and so eventually we will change to that.|s^cc
me011|and then you'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out.|s^df
me001|will that also include like batteries dying?|qy^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
me001|just any time the mike's putting out zeros basically.|s^bu
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|yep.|s^aa^r
me018|but with the screensaver kicking in it|s.%-
me011|now|%-
mn014|but|fg
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|well i'll turn off the screensaver too.|s^cc
me001|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me001|oops!|s^fe
me011|um the other thing is as i've said before it is actually on.|fh|s
me001|speaking of which.|s
me011|the thing.|s^e
me011|there's a little level meter.|s
me011|but of course no one ever pays attention to it.|s
me011|so i think having it on the screen is more easy to notice.|s
fe008|it would be nice if if these had little light indicators.|s^cs
fe008|little l e d's for|s^e.%-
me011|uh buzzer.|s^2^j
fe008|yeah a buzzer.|s^aa^j^r
me011|bamp bamp!|s^fe
me013|small shocks.|s^j
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|actually|%-
me013|administered to the|%-
me013|okay.|fg
me011|okay disk backup et cetera?|qy^d^rt^t^tc
me013|oh|fg
me011|um i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non backed up disk to save the overhead of backup.|s
me011|and he pretty much said yeah you could do that if you want.|s:s
me011|but he thought it was a bad idea.|s^ba
me011|in fact what he said is doing the manual one doing uh n w archive to copy it is a good idea.|s^ba^rt
me011|and we should do that and have it backed up.|s
me011|he he's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup.|s
me011|i mean his point was well taken.|s
me011|this data cannot be recovered.|s^df
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|and so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive.|s
me011|and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup.|s
me013|well i guess it is true that even with something that's backed up it's not going to|s.%--
me013|if it's stationary it's not going to go through the it's not going to burden things in the incremental backups.|s
me011|just just the monthly full.|s^2
fe008|huh|b
me013|yeah so the monthly full will be a bear.|s^aa|s
me013|but|fh
me011|yeah but he said that that we shouldn't worry too much about that.|s
me011|that we're getting a new backup system.|s^df
me011|and we're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it's probably okay.|s
me013|really?|qy^bh
me011|and uh so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings.|fh|s
me013|so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non backed up space for things that took less than twenty four hours to recreate or something like that.|s^bu
me011|things that are recreatable easily and also yeah basically things that are recreatable.|s^na
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|the expanded files and things like that.|s
me013|okay.|b
me011|they take up a lot more room anyway.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|uh but we do need more disk.|s
me013|so we can get more disk.|s^bk
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah so.|fh
me011|and i i think i agree with him.|s
me011|i mean his point was well taken that if we lose one of these we cannot get it back.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|i don't think there was any other et cetera there.|s^t
me013|well i was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh|s.%-
me022|i thought you guys were going to burn c d's.|s^bu
me011|um unfortunately we could burn c d's but first of all it's a pain.|h|s^ng
me022|yeah.|b
me011|because you have to copy it down to the p c and then burn it.|s^df^rt
me011|and that's a multi step procedure.|s^e^rt
me011|and second of all the the write once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last.|s
me022|yeah.|b
me011|so i think burning them for distribution is fine.|s^ba
me011|but burning them for backup is not a good idea.|s^ba
me022|i see.|s^bk
me011|because they they fail after a couple years.|s^df
me022|okay.|b
me022|all right.|b
fe008|i do have uh uh it's a different topic can i add one topic.|s^t^tc
fe008|we have time?|qy^rt
fe008|i wanted to ask|s.%--
fe008|i know that uh that thilo you were um bringing the channeltrans interface onto the windows machine.|s^bu^rt
mn014|yeah it's it basically it's done.|s
fe008|and i wanted to know is|s.%-
mn014|yeah.|b
fe008|it's all done that's wonderful great.|s^bk^m
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|yes since tcl t k runs on it basically things will just work.|s
mn014|yeah it|%-
mn014|yeah it was just a problem with the snack version and the transcriber version.|s
mn014|but it's solved.|fh
mn014|so|fh
fe008|does and that does that mean i|qy.%--
fe008|maybe i should know this but i don't.|s
fe008|does this mean that the that this could be uh ported to a think pad or some other type of uh|qy^bu.%-
mn014|yeah basically uh i did install it on my laptop.|s^aa
mn014|and yeah.|fh
fe008|wonderful.|s^bk
mn014|it worked.|s
fe008|wonderful.|s^bk^r
me013|huh!|b
me013|good.|s^ba
me013|crosspads?|qo^d^rt^t^tc
me011|uh i got an email from uh james landay.|s
me011|who basically said if you're not using them could you return them.|s^e:qy
me011|so he said he doesn't need them he just periodically at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them.|s
me011|and asks them if they're still using them.|s
me013|so we've never used them.|s^bu
fe008|we used them once.|s^nd
me011|we we used them a couple times.|s^nd
me013|once?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|uhhuh.|s^aa
me018|them?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|but|fh
fe008|couple times.|s^aa^m
me018|there's more than one?|qy^bu^d^e^rt
me011|yeah we have two.|s^aa|s^na
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me011|um|fg
me013|but|fg
me011|my opinion on it is|s.%--
me011|first i never take notes anyway.|s
me011|so i'm not going to use it.|s
me011|um and second it's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with.|fh|s
fe008|and i have uh so my my feeling on it is that i think in principle it's a really nice idea.|s^ba
fe008|and you have the time tags which makes it better than just taking raw notes.|s^ba
fe008|on the other hand i the down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy.|s
fe008|so you have kaplunk kaplunk kaplunk.|s:s
fe008|and i and i don't know if it's audible on the|s.%--
fe008|but i i sort of thought that was a disadvantage.|s
fe008|i do take notes.|s
fe008|i mean i could be taking notes on these things.|s^cs
fe008|and i guess the plus with the crosspads would be the time markings.|s
fe008|but|fh
fe008|i don't know.|s^no
mn014|uh what is a crosspad?|fg|qw^rt
me013|so it's it's um it's a regular pad just a regular pad of paper but there's this pen which indicates position.|s
me001|thank you.|s^ft^t3
me013|and so you have time and position stuff stored.|s
mn014|okay.|s^bk
me013|so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you've written.|s
mn014|okay.|s^bk
me011|and then you can download it.|s
me011|and they have o c r and searching and all sorts of things.|s
mn014|okay.|s^bk
mn014|okay.|b
me011|so if you take notes it's a great little device.|s
fe008|could uhhuh|%-
me011|but i don't take notes.|s
me013|and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher level things.|s
me011|so|fh
me013|not just the you know microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth.|s
me013|and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what what was it that happened in the meeting you know where would it come from.|s:qw
me013|and um i think that was one of the things.|fh|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|s^aa
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|and so the it seemed like a neat idea.|s^ba
me013|we'll have a you know have a scribe.|s^rt
me013|have somebody uh take good notes and then that's part of the record of the meeting.|s
me013|and then we did it once or twice and we sort of|s.%--
me011|yep and then just sort of died out.|s^aa|s
me013|probably chose the wrong scribe.|s^j
me013|but it was it's uh|s.%--
me011|yeah that's right.|s^aa
fe016|i mean|%-
fe008|well i did it one time.|s
fe008|but um|fh
me011|yep.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|but i guess the the other thing i'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing i wonder if we'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe.|s^cs
fe008|by listening to the tape to the recording afterwards.|s^cs^e
fe008|and taking notes in some other interface.|s^e
me018|i mean we're transcribing it anyways.|s
me018|why do we need notes?|qw^rt
fe008|oh it's it's useful.|s^nd
me011|because that's summary.|s^ng
fe008|have a summary and high points.|s^ng
fe016|i think|%-
me013|summary.|s^m
fe016|there's also|%-
fe016|there's this use that|s.%-
me018|summarize it from the transcription.|s^cs
fe016|the|%-
fe016|well what if you're sitting there and you just want to make an x?|qo
fe016|and you don't want to take notes.|s
fe016|and you're you just want to|s.%--
me018|doodle.|s^2^rt
fe016|get the summary of the transcript from this time location.|s
fe016|like you know and and then while you're bored you don't do anything.|s
fe016|and once in a while maybe there's a joke and you put a x.|s
fe016|but|fh
fe016|in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way.|s^bs^cs
fe016|also with i was thinking and i know morgan disagrees with me on this.|s
fe016|but suppose you have a group in here and you want to let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not want to distribute in terms of content.|s^rt
fe016|they could just sort of make an x near that point.|s^cs
fe016|or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they could get some red flags in that transcript region.|s^e
fe016|and they can then look at it.|s^e
fe016|so|fh
fe016|i know we haven't been using it.|s
fe016|but i i can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods.|s^cs
me011|right.|s^aa
fe016|which you then get back in a transcript.|s^e
fe008|well.|b
me013|i guess so you know what what makes one think is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later.|s^cs
fe016|so|fh
me013|and and and put some kind of summary or something.|s
me013|uh you know some there'd be some scribe who would actually listen who'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing.|fh|s^cs
me013|not transcribe it but just sort of write down things that struck them as important.|s
me013|but then you don't you don't have the time reference uh that you'd have if you had it live.|s
fe016|right.|s^aa
fe016|and you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful.|s
me013|yeah.|s^am
me018|how do you synchronize the time in the crosspad and the time of the recording?|qw
fe016|so|fh
me011|i mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally.|s
me011|and that's part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the crosspads.|s
me011|and so that means synchronizing the time|s.%--
fe016|oh.|b
me011|you know you want it pretty close.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|and there's a fair amount of skew because it's a hand held unit with a battery.|s
fe008|well when when i|fg|s.%-
me011|and so you|%-
fe008|okay.|b
me011|so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used.|s^co
me011|so that it's synchronized with the time on that.|s^df
me011|and then you have to download to an application.|s^e
me011|and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you want to do anything with this information.|s^e
me011|and so there's a lot of infrastructure which|s.%-
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me022|why|qw.%-
fe008|there is an alternative.|s^cs^nd
me011|unless someone|%-
fe008|there is an alternative.|s^r
fe008|i mean it's still there's uh you know your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure.|s^na
fe008|but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock's timer on it.|s
fe008|you i mean i when i when i did it i synchronized it by voice.|s
fe008|by whispering one two three four onto the microphone.|s^e
me011|huh|b
fe008|and uh you know.|fh|s^f
me011|well but then there's the infrastructure at the other end.|s
me022|right.|b
me011|which someone has to listen to that and find that point.|s^e
fe008|yeah it's transcribed.|s^na
me011|and then mark it.|s^e
fe008|it's in the transcript.|s
me011|so|fh
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|well it's in the transcript.|s^r
fe016|well could we keep one of these things for another year?|qy^rt
fe016|would i mean is there a big|s^df.%-
me011|we can keep all both of them for the whole whole year.|s^na
fe016|just just in case we|s^df.%-
me011|i mean it's just|s.%-
fe016|even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate.|s
fe016|uh just there's a bunch of things that might be neat to do.|s
fe016|but i it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure.|s
fe016|but we could at least try it out.|s^cs
me013|well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings some collection of meetings maybe e d u is the right one or maybe something else.|fg|s
me013|we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task.|s^cs
me013|i mean|%-
fe016|right.|s^aa
me013|uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes.|s
me011|yep.|s^aa
me013|and|fh
me013|and so forth.|s^e
me013|so and and jane is more into it.|fh|s
me013|but uh uh|fh
me013|you know i don't know if you want to really do do this all the time.|s^no
me013|so i think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it.|s^cs
me013|and have at least some series of meetings where we do it.|s^cs^e
me013|um|fh
me013|and if so it's probably worth having one.|s
me013|the the the problem with the the more extended view|s.%--
me013|all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it|s^e.%--
me013|is that it looks like it's hard to get people to um uh routinely use it.|s^e
me013|i mean it just hasn't happened anyway.|s
me013|but maybe if we can get a person to|s^cs.%-
fe016|yeah i don't think it has to be part of what everybody does in a meeting.|s
fe016|but it might be a useful neat part of the project.|s^ba
fe016|that we can you know show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time.|s^df
fe016|that happen that you just want to make a note of.|s^df^e
fe016|like what jane was talking about.|s
fe016|with some later browsing just just as a convenience.|s^e
fe016|even if it's not a full blown note taking substitute.|s
me022|well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a p d a with a wireless card.|s^cs
me022|and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting.|s
me022|because you'll be you can synchronize with the the linux server.|s^df
me022|and uh|fh
fe016|so what kind of input would you be|qw.%--
me022|so so i mean if you're not worried about|s.%-
me011|buttons.|s^cs
fe016|you'd just be pressing like a a|qy^d.%-
me022|well well you have a p d a.|s^cs
me022|and and you could have the same sort of x interface or whatever.|s^cs^e
me022|i mean you'd have to do a little uh a little bit of coding to do it.|s
fe016|uhhuh.|b
me022|but you could imagine|s.%--
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|that be good.|s^ba
me022|i mean if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note taking channel.|s
me022|but just sort of being able to use markers of some sort.|s
me022|a p d a with a a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go.|s^cs
me022|i mean even buttons you could do.|s^cs
me022|sort of.|s^e
me022|i mean as you said.|s
me011|i mean for what what you've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else.|s^cs
fe016|right.|s^aa
me011|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|that would be fine too.|s^ba
me011|you have the|s.%-
me022|right.|s^aa
fe016|i mean i don't have you know grandiose ideas in mind.|s
fe016|but i'm just sort of thinking well we've we're getting into the next year now.|s:s
fe016|and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech.|s
fe016|maybe somebody will be interested in this.|s
fe016|and|fh
fe008|i like this p d a idea.|s^ba
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|yeah i do like the idea of having a couple buttons.|s^na
me011|well i'm sure there would|s.%-
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|where like one one button was uh oh.|s^e:s^fe
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|and then another button was that's great.|s^e:s^ba
me013|and another button that's|s.%-
fe016|or like this is my i'm supposed to do this kind of button.|s^2:s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|like i better remember to|s.%--
me011|action item.|s^2
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|something like that.|s^e
fe016|or|%--
me011|i mean i think the crosspad idea is a good one.|s^ba
fe008|and then|%-
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|it's just a question of getting people to use it.|s^df
me011|and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it's not a lot of extra work.|s^df
me011|i mean that's part of the reason why it hasn't happened.|s^df
me011|is that it it's been a lot of extra work for me.|s^e
fe016|yeah.|b
me013|right.|b
me011|and|fh
fe008|well and not just for you.|s^nd
fe008|but it's also it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a a digital record too.|s^ng
fe008|doesn't it?|qy^g^rt
me011|well it's digital but it's in a format that is not particularly standard.|s^aap
fe008|i mean|%-
fe008|but i mean say if if if you're writing if you're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition.|s
fe008|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|no no but it's just it's just storing the pixel position information.|s^aa|s^na
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|it's all digital.|s
fe008|i i guess what i'm thinking is that the p d a solution you you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a|s.%--
fe008|i mean|%-
me013|right.|s^aa
me013|you don't have to|s.%-
me022|the transfer function is less errorful.|s^na
me022|yes.|s^aa
fe016|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|oh nicely put.|s^ba
me013|yeah yeah.|b
fe016|well it also it's maybe realistic because people are supposed to be bringing their p d a's to the meeting eventually.|s
fe016|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|that's why we have this little|s^df.%--
fe016|i don't know what i don't want to cause more work for anyone.|s
fe016|but i can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it.|s
fe016|and so if we don't have to return it|s.%--
fe016|and we can keep it for a year|s.%--
fe016|i don't know.|s^no
me011|well we don't we certainly don't have to return it.|fg|s
me011|as i said all all he said is that if you're not using it could you return it if you are using it feel free to keep it.|s^df
me011|the point is that we haven't used it at all.|s
me011|and are we going to.|s:qy
me013|so we have no|s.%--
me013|but uh by i i would suggest you return one.|s^co
me011|okay.|s^bk
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me013|because we we you know we we haven't used it at all.|s^df
fe016|we|%-
me013|we have some aspirations of using them.|s
fe016|one would probably be fine.|s^cs
fe016|maybe we could do like a student project.|s^cs
me013|and|fh
fe016|you know maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like project for something would be cool.|s^ba
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yep.|b
me011|i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more.|s^cs
me013|maybe jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed.|s^cs^j
me011|although there is a little|s.%-
fe016|well i'm yeah that's not a bad|fg|s.%-
me013|yeah yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|jeremy's going to be an he's a new student starting on modeling breath and laughter actually.|s
fe016|which sounds funny.|s^rt
fe016|but i think it should be cool.|s^ba^rt
fe016|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
me011|sounds breathy to me.|s^j
fe016|okay.|b
me011|breath and|s.%--
fe016|ha ha ha.|s^j
me011|ha ha ha ha.|s^j^m
me011|ha ha ha ha.|s^j^r
me013|well dear!|s^fe
me011|um|fg
me013|huh.|b
me011|that reminded me of something.|s
me011|oh well.|s^bd
me011|too late.|s^bd
me011|it slipped out.|s^bd
me013|okay.|fg
me011|oh!|fg
fe016|you're you're going to tease me?|qy^rt^t3
me011|equipment.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me011|ordered|%-
me011|uh well i'm always going to do that.|s
me011|uh we ordered uh more wireless.|fh|s
me011|and so they should be coming in at some point.|s
fe016|great.|s^ba
me011|and then at the same time i'll probably rewire the room as per jane's suggestion.|s^cc
me011|so that uh the first n channels are wireless uh are the the close talking and the next n are far field.|s^df
me013|you know what he means.|s
me013|but isn't that funny sounding?|qh^rt
me013|we ordered more wireless.|s:s
me013|it's like wires are the things.|s
me013|so you're wiring   you're you're you we're we ordered more absence of the thing.|s
fe016|that's a very philosophical statement from morgan.|s^j
me011|wired less wired more.|s^j
fe016|i just it's sort of a anachronism.|s
fe016|i mean it's like|s.%--
fe016|it's great.|s
me011|should we do digits?|qy^rt^t^tc
me013|anyway.|fg
me011|do we have anything else?|qy^rt^t^tc
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|okay.|b
me013|i mean there's there's all this stuff going on uh between uh andreas and and and dave and chuck and others with various kinds of runs.|s
me013|uh um recognition runs.|fh|s^e
me013|trying to figure things out about the features.|s
me013|but it's it's all sort of in process.|s
me013|so there's not much to say.|s
me013|right now.|s^e
me013|uh why don't we start with our our esteemed guest?|fh|qh^cs^t
me022|okay.|fg
me022|all right.|fh
me011|so just the transcript number and then the then the|s^co.%-
me022|this is|%-
me022|yes this is number two for me today.|s^aa|s^na
me013|see all you have to do is go away to move way up in the|s.%-
me022|oh.|b
fe016|we could do simultaneous.|s^cs
fe016|initiate him.|s^df
me013|we we could.|s^na
me011|should we do simultaneous?|qy^rt
fe016|well i'm just thinking are you going to try to save the data before this next group comes in?|fg|qy
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|absolutely.|s^aa
fe016|yeah so we might want to do it simultaneous.|s^cs^r^rt
me011|i mean you sort of have to.|s^na
fe016|right so|s^aa|%-
me013|well okay so let's do one of those simultaneous ones.|fg|s^co
fe016|so we might we might need to do that actually.|s
me011|okay.|b
me013|that sounds good.|s^ba
me022|okay.|b
me013|everybody ready?|qy^d^rt
fe008|yeah.|s^aa
me013|a one.|s
fe016|you have to plug your ears by the way uh eric.|s^co
me011|well i have to.|s^na
fe016|or|%-
me011|i don't know about other people.|s^no
fe016|or you start laughing.|s^df
me022|okay all right.|s^bk
mn014|you don't have to.|s^nd
me013|okay.|fg
me013|a one and a two and a three.|s
me013|okay babble take five.|z
me013|yeah.|z
me011|okay we're on.|s
me011|so i think this is going to be a pretty short meeting because i have four agenda items.|s^t
me011|three of them were requested by jane who is not going to be at the meeting today.|s
me011|tsk.|b
me011|so the uh first was transcription status.|h|s^rt^t
me011|does anyone besides jane know what the transcription status is?|qy^rt
me018|um sort of i do peripherally.|fg|s
me018|um well first of all with i b m i got a note from brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago.|h|s
mn014|is that english?|qy^rt^t1
mn017|that's our system.|s
me011|ugh!|s^fe
me018|and that it's gone out to the transcribers.|s
me018|and hopefully next week we'll have the transcription back from that.|s
me018|um jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the icsi side.|h|s
me011|can i have a pen?|qy
me018|she's assigned i think probably five or six more meetings.|s
mn014|yeah i think we're up to m r thirteen or something.|s^e
me018|yeah so um i guess she's hired some new transcribers.|fg|s
mn017|huh.|b
me018|and|%-
me001|which meetings is she transcribing?|qw^rt
mn017|speaking|s^t1.%-
me018|um well we've we've run out of e d us because a certain number of them are um sort of awaiting to go to i b m.|h|s
me001|okay.|s^bk
mn014|for i b m yeah.|s^2
me001|okay.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me018|and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.|s
me001|so we're doing some in parallel.|s^bu
mn017|so does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from i b m?|qy^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
me018|no.|s^ar
me018|oh no no.|s^ar^r
me011|no no.|s^ar
me018|no.|s^ar^r
mn017|no?|qy^bu^d^r^rt
me018|we're not waiting on them.|s
me011|we haven't done that process.|s
me011|so they're doing the full transcription process.|s^e
mn017|oh.|s^bk
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|yeah.|b
me001|so they're just doing their own thing until|s^bu.%-
mn017|because i i need to ask jane whether it's it would be okay for her um some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the smartkom data collection which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.|s
me018|we're doing it in parallel yeah.|s^na
me001|okay.|s^bk
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|um and we want it you know we need|s.%--
mn017|the again we we have a similar uh logistic set up where we are supposed to send the data to munich.|s
mn017|and get it transcribed and get it back.|s
me011|right.|b
mn017|but to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started.|s
me011|yep sounds familiar.|s^ba
mn017|and so um i wanted to ask jane if if uh you know maybe one of their transcribers could could do|s.%--
mn017|i mean since these are very short that should really be uh|s.%-
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|um it's|%-
mn014|there's only two channels.|s
mn014|so it's only|%-
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|it's only two|s.%-
mn014|yeah.|fg
mn014|as the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed i think.|s
mn017|right|fg
mn014|so|fh
mn017|yeah.|fg
mn017|so so it's basically one channel to transcribe.|s
mn017|and it's|s.%--
mn017|one session is only uh like seven|s.%-
me013|so that should have many fewer|s.%--
me013|and it's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that.|s^e
mn017|right.|s^aa
mn017|and some of it is read speech so we could give them the the thing that they're reading.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|so|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and they just may|s.%-
me011|make sure it's right?|qy^2^d^rt
mn017|and so um|fh
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|um i guess since she's|fh|s.%--
mn017|i was going to ask her but since she's not around i maybe i'll|s.%-
me013|yeah well it certainly seems|fg|s.%-
mn017|uh if if that's okay with you to to you know get that stuff uh to ask her for that then i'll do that.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah if we're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that that's okay because i i um i mean i still have high hopes that the that the i b m pipeline will work out for us so it's|s.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|okay yeah.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|alrighty.|s^bk
me018|oh yeah and also related to the transcription stuff.|fg|s^tc
me018|so i've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date showing what the current status is of the of all the things we've collected.|s
me018|and what stage each meeting is in in terms of whether it's|s.%-
me011|can you mail that out to the list?|qy^rt
me018|uhhuh yeah i will.|s^aa^cc
me018|i|%--
me018|that's the thing that i sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages.|s
me018|and so that's where i'm putting it but i'll|s.%--
me011|oh okay okay.|s^bk
me018|i'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.|s^cc
me011|yeah i haven't done that.|s
me011|so i have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|i'll try to get to that.|s^cc
me011|okay.|s^bk^rt^tc
me011|so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval but i don't really think there's much to talk about.|s
me011|i'm just going to do it.|s^cc
me011|and uh if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.|s
me013|you are going to|qy^bu^d.%-
me011|i'm going to send out to the participants uh with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits.|s^cc
me011|and then bleep them out.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|for the ones that we have.|s
me011|um|fh
mn014|so but it's just transcripts not the not the audio?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|nope they'll have access to the audio also.|s^ar|s
mn014|okay yeah yep.|s^bk
mn014|uh|h
me011|i mean that's my intention.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|because the transcripts might not be right.|s
me018|so|fg
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|so you want people to be able to listen to them.|s
me018|so um the audio that they're going to have access to will that be the uncompressed version?|qy^d^rt
me018|or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and|qrr.%-
me011|oh that's a good point.|s^ba
me011|that's a good point.|s^ba^r
me011|yeah it's it's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because uh uh it takes too long to do random access decompression.|h|s
me018|huh.|b
me018|yeah i was just wondering because we're uh running out of the un backed up disk space on|s.%-
me011|well that was the other point.|s
me018|oh was that another one?|qy^bu
me011|yep that's another agenda item.|s^t
me018|okay.|s^bk
me018|i'll wait.|s^cc
me011|so uh|h
me011|but that is a good point so we'll get to that too.|s^ba
me011|um darpa demo status not much to say.|h|s
me011|the back end stuff is working out fine.|s
me011|it's more or less ready to go.|s
me011|i've added some stuff that uh indexes by the meeting type m r e d u et cetera.|s
me011|and also by the user i d.|s
me011|so that the front end can then do filtering based on that as well.|s
me011|uh the back end is uh going more slowly as i i think i said before just because i'm not much of a tcl t. k. programmer.|fh|s
me011|and uh dave gelbart says he's a little too busy.|fh|s
me011|so i think don and i are going to work on that and and you and i can just talk about it off line more.|s
me001|right.|b
me011|but uh the back end was pretty smooth.|fh|s
me013|oh.|fg
me011|so i think we'll have something.|s
me011|it may not be as as pretty as we might like but we'll have something.|s
me013|i wondered when we would reach dave's saturation point.|s
me013|he's sort of been been volunteering for everything.|s
me013|and and uh|%--
me011|yeah.|s^bk
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay!|s^fe^rt
me013|finally said he was too busy.|s
me013|i guess we reached it.|s
me011|yeah he he actually he volunteered but then he then he retracted it.|fg|s
me011|so|fh
me011|oh well.|s^bd
me011|um|fg
me001|and also um i was just showing andreas i got um an x waves kind of display.|fg|s^tc
me001|and i don't know how much more we can do with it.|s^no
me001|with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom.|s
me011|oh cool.|s^ba
me001|so right now it's just an x waves.|s
me001|and then you have three windows.|s
me001|but i don't know it looked pretty nice.|s
me001|and i'm sure it think it has potential for a little something.|s
me011|for a demo?|qy^d^rt
me001|yeah for a demo.|s^aa^r
me011|yeah sounds good.|s^bk
me001|so|fh
me013|okay so again the issue is for july the issue's going to be what can we fit into a windows machine uh and so on.|fg|s
me001|oh.|b
me013|but|fh
me001|okay.|s^bk
me011|so it might just be slides.|s
me001|yeah okay.|s^bk
me001|well we'll see um|s.%-
mn014|well yeah.|b
mn014|i've been putting together uh transcriber things for windows.|s
mn014|so|%--
mn014|and i installed it on dave gelbart's p c and it worked just fine.|s
mn014|so hopefully that will work.|s
mn017|really?|qy^bh
mn017|so is that|qy^rt.%--
mn017|because there's some people um|s.%--
mn017|it would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at at s r i.|s^cs
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|because the um|s^df.%--
mn014|yep.|s^bk
mn017|we have we have more windows machines to run the|s.%--
me011|well transcriber is tcl t. k. very generic with snack.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|so basically anything you can get snack to run on it will work.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn014|yeah.|fg
mn014|yeah.|fg
mn014|but but the problem is the version transcriber works with the snack version is one point six whatever.|s
mn014|and that's not anymore supported.|s
mn014|it's not on on the web page anymore.|s
mn014|but i just wrote an email to to the author of to the snack author.|s
mn014|and he sent me to one point six whatever library.|s
mn014|and so it works.|s
me011|well i thought it was packaged with transcriber.|s^bu
mn014|yeah.|s^aap
mn014|but then you can't add our patches.|s^arp
mn014|and then the the new version is is totally different.|s
me011|oh.|s^bk
mn014|and in yeah in terms of of the source code.|s
mn014|you you can't find the tcl files anymore.|s
me011|uh.|b
mn014|it's some whatever wrapped thing.|s
mn017|huh.|b.%
mn014|and you can't you can't access that.|s^e
mn014|so you have to install first install tcl then install snack.|s
mn014|and then install the transcriber thing.|s
mn014|and then do the patches.|s
me011|patch.|s^2
mn017|i i wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along|s^cs.%-
me011|ugh!|s^fe
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|we have.|s
mn017|we have?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
me011|yeah it's just hasn't made it into the release yet.|s^aa|s
mn017|oh.|s^bk
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|so did you um put the uh the n t version out on the uh meeting recorder page or|qr^tc.%--
mn014|no i haven't done that yet.|s^ar
mn014|i'm|%--
mn014|oh nope.|s^ar
mn014|but i definitely will do that.|s^cc
me013|so can some of the stuff that don's talking about somehow fit into this?|qy^tc
me013|uh mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the|fh|s.%--
me001|yeah.|b
me001|yeah it's basically ascii files or binary files whatever representation.|s
mn014|so|fh
me001|just three different|s.%--
me001|it's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's|s.%--
me001|i mean we could do it in i mean you could do it in a number of different places i'm sure.|s
mn017|so so well|fg
mn017|but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time time synchronous with the waveform.|s^cs
mn014|yep.|b
me001|yeah.|b
me001|yeah that'd be very cool.|s^aa^ba
me013|yes.|b
me011|it'd be easy enough to add that.|s
me011|again it's it's it's more tcl t. k. programming.|s^ng
me001|yeah.|b
me011|so someone who's familiar with tcl t. k. has to do it.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|right.|b
me011|but uh it wouldn't be hard to do.|s
mn017|but it would almost be like having another waveform displayed.|s
me001|uhhuh.|b
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah maybe we could look into that.|s^cs
me001|yeah.|b
me011|but it it seems to me that i|s.%--
mn014|and|%-
me011|it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary.|s
me011|so it seems to me you could do images.|s
me001|um what do you mean by real time?|h|qw
me001|do you mean like|qy.%-
me018|like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.|s^bu^rt
me001|okay.|s^bk
me018|is that what you mean?|qy^rt
me011|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|b
me011|it just seems to me|s.%--
me001|it would be cool to see it.|s.x
me001|it would be cool like to see to hear it and see it.|s
mn014|and to hear it.|s^2
mn014|yeah.|b
me001|and see the pitch contours also.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|sure but i don't think i you can do all that just statically in powerpoint.|s^aap|s^nd
me001|i think it would lose|s.%-
me001|yeah i mean|s.%-
me011|just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that's|s.%-
me001|right right.|fg
me001|i just thought if you meant slides i thought you meant like just like um view graphs or something.|s^df
me013|you know|%--
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so uh|%--
me013|no we're talking about on the computer.|s
me001|right.|b
me013|and and um i think when we were talking about this before we had this little demo meeting.|fg|s
me013|we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have.|s
me013|and the more live the better but uh given the crunch of time we may have to retreat from it to some extent.|s
me013|so i think for a lot of reasons i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so it'd be a good thing to get in there.|s
me013|but|fh
me013|um anyway just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing uh in to people.|fh|s
me001|uhhuh.|b
me013|because a lot of this stuff particularly for communicator uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about originally had had to do with prosodics.|s
me013|it'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them.|s
me001|uhhuh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me011|and the last item on the agenda is disk issues yet again.|s^tc
me011|so we're doing okay on backed up.|s
me011|we're we're only about thirty per cent on the second disk.|s
me011|so uh we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical.|s
me011|but we are like ninety five per cent ninety eight per cent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|and my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space.|s^rt
me011|but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once in a lot of different ways.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
me018|oh there's a lot of transcribers too.|s
me011|yeah there're a lot of transcribers.|s^bk|s^m
mn014|yeah.|b
me011|so all of those need to be expanded.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|and then people are doing chunking and i want to do uh uh uh the permission forms.|s^rt^t
me018|right.|b
me011|so i want those to be live so there's a lot of data that has to be around.|s
me011|um and jane was going to talk to uh dave johnson about it.|fh|s
me011|one of the things i was thinking is we we just got these hundred|s.%--
me011|all right excuse me.|s^fa
me011|ten uh sparc blade sun blades.|s
me013|did they come in?|qy^rt
me018|sun blades.|s^r
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|yeah.|b
me018|they came in the other day.|s
me011|they came in but they're not set up yet.|s^r
me013|oh.|s^bk
me011|and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they'll be in the machine room.|s^cs
me011|they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines.|s^e
me011|and if we just need un backed up space we could just hang disks off them.|s
me018|well is there|qy.%--
me018|why not just hang them off of abbott?|qw^cs^nd
me018|is there a|qy.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me011|because there's no more room in the disk racks on abbott.|s
me018|uh.|s^bk
me018|uh i see.|s^bk
me013|weren't we going to get|qy^bu.%--
me013|well maybe it should get another rack.|s^cs
mn017|but you still need to store the disks somehow.|s
me011|well but the sun blades have spare drive bays.|s
mn017|so|%-
me018|you can put two|s^cs.%--
me011|just put them in.|s^co
mn017|oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the|qy^bu^d^rt.%-
mn014|internal.|s
me011|sure.|b
mn014|yeah.|b.%
me011|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|oh.|s^bk
me011|because the sun uh these sun blades take commodity hard drives.|s
me011|so you can just go out and buy a p c hard drive and stick it in.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|but if abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it uh a second disk rack or something.|s^cs
mn017|plus we're talking about buying a second uh file server.|s^e^rt
me011|well i mean there are lots of long term solutions.|s^ba
me011|what i'm looking for is where do we expand the next meeting?|qh
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|i see oh i see.|s^bk
me013|well for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten.|s
me013|mightn't you?|qy^g
me013|uh you know dave johnson is gone for like ten days.|fh|s^df^f
me011|oh i didn't know he had left already.|s^no
me013|uh well tonight.|h|s^bsc
me011|oh oh well.|s^by
mn017|you mean he won't set up the|qy^bu^d.%--
mn017|huh.|b
me001|how much space do you need for these?|qw^rt
me013|i don't know.|s^no
me013|i don't know what his schedule is.|s^no
me011|you we need about a gig per meeting.|s
me013|i'm just saying he's gone.|s

mn014|yep.|b
me001|i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.|s
me011|all right!|s^ba^fe
me001|so|h
me011|what's your computer's name?|qw^rt
me001|uh samosa.|h|s^rt
me013|you had an eighteen gigabyte drive.|s^bc
me001|yeah i had.|s^aa
me001|well it's about i think there's about twelve gig left.|s
me011|so it and you have an x drives installed?|qy^bu^d^rt
me001|yeah.|s^aa
me011|okay.|s^bk
me001|so i didn't realize it was so critical.|fg|s
me011|and you're you're offering|qy^d.%-
me001|i mean i'm not doing anything on it right now until i get new meetings to or that are new transcriptions coming in i really can't do anything.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me018|i i i just gave thilo some about ten gigs the last ten gigs of space that there was on on uh abbott.|s
me001|um not that i can't do anything i|s.%-
me018|uh and uh|fh
me018|so but that but|s.%--
me011|which one was that?|qw

me018|yeah.|b
mn017|x g?|qw^bu^d^rt
mn017|that's also where we store the the uh hub five training set waveforms.|s^bu
mn014|oops.|s^fa
me018|no.|s^ar
mn017|right?|qy^d^g
me011|but that won't be getting any bigger.|s^bu
me018|i don't think that's on x g.|s
me011|will it?|qy^g
mn017|right.|s^aa
me018|on x g is only carmen and and stephane's disk.|s
mn014|it's|%
mn017|but i've also been storing i've been storing the feature files there.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn017|and i guess i can start deleting some because we now know what the best features are.|s
me001|well|fg
mn017|and we won't be using the old ones anymore.|s
me018|yeah i i don't think it was on x g.|s^r
me001|i have a lot of space though.|s
mn017|uh oh thats x. a oh that's x|s.%--
mn014|isn't that x h?|qy^bu^rt
me018|i|%-
me001|i have a lot of space and it's not it's|s.%-

mn017|oh no i'm sorry.|s^fa
me001|it's not being used often at all.|s

me011|yeah it's probably probably only about four gig is on x on your x drive.|s
mn014|so|s.%-
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|but we'll definitely take it up if you|s.%-
me001|i|%-
mn017|i think you're right.|s^na
me001|i think it's about four or five gig.|s
mn017|it's x h and d|s.%-
me001|because i have four meetings on there.|s
mn017|the|%-
mn017|i'm also using d g.|s
mn017|i got that confused.|s
me001|three or four meetings.|s
mn017|okay k.|s
me011|great.|s^ba^tc
me001|so|s.%--
me013|we need|s.%-
me011|okay so that will get us through the next couple days.|s^tc
me013|we need another gigaquad.|s^cs^j
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|at least.|s^e
me013|there should i there should just be a i should have a button.|s
me013|just press press each meeting saying we need more disk space this week.|s
me011|the more disk space button?|qy^d^rt
me011|yep.|b
me013|skip the rest of the conversation.|s^co
me018|well we've collected so far something like uh sixty five meetings.|s
me018|and it's about a gig uncompressed.|s
me013|and and how much does each meeting take?|qw^rt
mn014|it's it's a little bit more as i usually don't do not uncompress the all of the p z m and the p d a things.|s^bc
me018|is a little more?|qy^bu^m^rt
me018|right yeah so if you uncompressed everything it's even more.|s^bk|s
mn014|so|%-
mn014|it's|%-
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|one point five or something.|s
me018|uh compressed how much are they?|qw
me018|like|%-
me011|half a gig.|s
me018|about half?|qy^bh^d^rt
me011|for all of them.|s
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
mn014|yep.|b
me018|so we're definitely are storing you know all of those.|s
me018|so there's what?|qw^t1
me018|thirty some gig of just meetings so far?|qy^bs
me013|so so so maybe there's a hundred gig or something.|s
me013|or|fh.%
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean because we we have the uncompressed around also.|s
me018|right.|b
mn014|yeah.|b
me013|so it's like|s.%-
me018|right.|b
me018|well we we haven't uncompressed all the meetings.|s
me018|but|fh
me011|i would like to.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|well i mean it's they really are cheap.|s
me013|i mean it's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them.|s
me018|right.|b
me011|yep.|b
me013|but but uh we could you know if you want to get four disks get four disks.|s
me013|i mean it's it's small i mean these things are just a few hundred dollars.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me018|well i sent that message out to i guess you and dave asking for if we could get some disk.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|i i sent this out a a day ago.|s
me011|and put it where?|qw
me013|right.|b
me018|but and dave didn't respond so i i don't know how the whole process works.|s
me018|i mean does he just go out and get them and if it's okay and|qy.%--
me011|yep.|b
me018|so i was assuming he was going to take over that.|s
me018|but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving.|s
me013|yeah i think you need a direct conversation with him.|s^cs
me013|and just say an just ask him that you know what should you do.|s^cs:qw
me013|and in my answer back was are you sure you just want one.|s:qy
me013|so i mean i think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure well here's what we figure on doing for the next few months.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me011|i know what they want.|s
me011|the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|so they don't want to stack up external drives.|s
me011|um and then they want everything else in the machine room.|fh|s
me013|right.|b
me011|so the question is where are you going to hang them?|qw
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|i don't know what the space situation is in the machine room.|s
me011|right.|b
me018|so|%-
me013|right.|b
me013|so this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave.|s
mn017|the|%-
me018|i think part of the reason why dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now.|s
me013|because it|s^df.%-
mn017|one|%-
mn017|huh.|%
me011|yep.|b
mn017|one one one thing to to um to do when you need to conserve space is|s.%--
me018|so he has to re arrange a bunch of stuff.|s
mn017|i bet there are still some old uh like nine gig disks uh around.|s
mn017|and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks.|s
mn017|and and you know recover the space.|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|no.|fg
me013|i think dave dave knows all these things of course.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|and so he always has a lot of plans of things that he's going to do to make things better in many ways and runs out of time.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me011|but i i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk.|s
me011|and so i think what he's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system rather than on new disk.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
me011|so|fh
me013|well.|fg
me013|so|s.%--
me011|which|%-
me013|but this this is a very specific question for me.|s
me013|basically we can easily get one to four disks.|s
me013|i mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it.|s
me013|it's no big deal.|s
me013|uh but the question is where they go?|fh|qo
me013|and i don't think we can solve that here.|s
mn017|maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there.|s^cs
me013|you just have to ask him.|s^cs
me011|yeah really.|s^aa
me013|attach to|s.%-
me011|popcorn.|s^2
mn017|to the machine that collects the data.|s^2^rt
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|so then you could at least temporarily store stuff there.|s^rt
mn017|the only|%-
me018|huh.|b.%
me011|yeah it's just it's not on the net so it's a little awkward.|s^arp
mn017|what do you mean it's not on the net?|qw^bu
me011|it's not|s.%--
mn014|it's not bad.|s
me011|it's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except s s h.|s
mn017|oh because it's because it's an aciri machine?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn017|oh oh oh.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net.|s
me011|but who knows when that will happen?|qh
me018|that might be a good short term solution though.|s
mn017|but that can't be that hard.|s
mn017|i mean|fh
me011|no the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers.|s
mn017|oh|%-
me011|so they actually have to run a wire somewhere.|s
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|yeah again you know any one of these things is certainly not a big deal.|s
me013|if there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's it's everybody everybody has a has|s.%-
me011|but dave has to do all of them.|s^arp
me013|well all of us have long lists of different things we're doing.|s^nd
me013|but at any rate i think that there's a there's a longer term thing and there's immediate need.|s
me013|and i think we need a a conversation with|s^cs.%--
me013|uh maybe maybe after after tea or something you and i can go down and and talk to him about it.|fh|s^cs.x
me013|just say you know what should we do right now.|s
me018|how long is david going to be gone?|qw^rt
me013|uh eleven days or something.|h|s^rt
me011|oh my!|s^fe
me013|yeah.|b
me013|basically tomorrow and all of the week after.|s^e
me011|and that's all i have.|s^rt^tc
me013|um|fg
me013|let's see.|h
me013|the only thing other thing i was going to add was that um uh i talked briefly to mari.|s
me013|and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here.|s
me013|but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the friday after next.|s
me013|and i i i wanted to make it um after the next one of these meetings.|s
me013|so something that we want to do next meeting is is uh to put together um a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it um that we've done.|s
me013|i mean just sort of bulletize i mean i can i can dream up text but this is basically going to lead to the annual report.|s
me013|so um if|fh|%-
mn017|uhhuh.|b.%
me011|this is the fifteenth?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|um that would|h|%-
me011|so just a week from tomorrow?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|so uh we can|fh|%--
me013|this|%-
mn017|is this got to be in the morning?|qy^rt
me013|so that's an|%-
me013|um|h
mn017|or|%--
mn017|because you know i fridays i have to leave uh like around uh two.|s
mn017|so if it could be before that would be be|s^cs.%-
me013|no no but i i i don't need other folks for the meeting.|s^nd
me013|i can do it.|s
mn017|oh okay all right.|s^bk
me013|all i'm saying is that on|s.%-
mn017|oh i'm sorry i misunderstood.|s^fa
mn017|i thought you are|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so what i meant was on the this meeting if i something i i i'm making a major thing in the agenda is i want to help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so i can tell her.|s
mn017|okay.|b
mn017|all right.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|okay.|b
me013|i think i have a pretty good idea.|s
me013|but but um|fh
me013|uh and then the next day uh late in the day i'll be having that that discussion with her.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|um so|fh
mn017|um uh one thing i mean we in past meetings we had um also you know various variously talked about the um work that uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side.|fg|s^tc
mn017|um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so um and i wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting.|s^cs
mn017|and between you know whoever's interested in that.|s
mn017|because i feel that uh there's plenty of stuff to talk about.|s^df
mn017|but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh|s.%--
me013|think so?|qy^bh
mn017|well it's that it's just going to be very boring for people who are not you know sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system.|s
me011|i'm interested.|s^nd
mn014|me too.|s^aa
me013|well okay so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition?|fg|qw
me018|jane may not be.|s
me011|jane i think.|s
mn017|well i know well jane|s.%--
mn014|yep.|b
mn017|well you mean in a separate meeting or talking about it in this|qr.%--
me011|no.|s^ar
me011|if we talked about it in this meeting.|s
me018|he's wondering how much overlap there will be.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah so you're|fg|%-
me013|so|%-
mn017|so|fg
mn017|uh uh|fh
mn017|liz and jane probably.|s
me013|okay so we're going to have a guy's meeting.|s^bk|s
me018|good thing liz isn't here.|s
me013|real|%-
mn017|uh if you want to put it that way.|s
me001|watch a ball game?|qy^d^j^rt
me013|yeah real real real men real men do decoding or something like that.|s^j
me018|don't listen to this liz.|s^co^t3
mn017|right.|b
me013|uh|%-
mn017|i mean it's sort of i mean when when the talk is about data collection stuff sometimes i've you know i i'm bored.|s^by
me013|yeah.|b
me011|the nod off?|qy^j^rt
mn017|so it's i i can sympathize with them not wanting to to to be uh you know if i you know this could|s.%-
me013|it's because you have a|s.%-
me013|so you need a better developed feminine side.|s^co
mn017|heh!|b
mn017|i'm not sure i want to|s.%-
me013|there's probably going to be a lot of bleeps in this meeting.|s
me011|yeah i would i would guess.|s^aa
me013|uh um|fh
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|and|%-
me013|i think it must be uh nearing the end of the week.|s
me013|um yeah.|fh|s^bk
me013|i you know i i've heard some comments about like this.|s^tc
me013|that could be.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b.%
me013|i mean the|%--
me013|um|fh|%-
mn017|and we don't have to do it every week.|s^cs
me018|could we|qy.%-
mn017|we could do it every other week or so.|s^cs
me018|right i was|s^aa|%-
mn017|you know or whenever we feel like we|s.%-
me018|why don't we alternate this meeting every other week?|qw^cs^rt
me011|or just alternate the focus.|s^2^cs^ng
me018|that's what i mean.|s
me011|yeah so on even weeks have basic on data.|s^e
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|we could do that yeah.|s^na
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|i i personally i'd i'm not in favor of more meetings.|s
mn017|um because uh|fh|s.%-
me013|right.|b
mn017|you know|%-
me011|i am.|s^j^nd
me011|oh|s^fa.%-
me018|but i i don't i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder.|s
mn017|right.|b
me018|so if we did that|s.%-
me011|well except that we keep going for our full time.|s
mn014|yep.|b
me018|well because we get into these other topics.|fg|s^ng
me001|yeah.|b
mn017|we feel we feel obligated to collect more data.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me018|so if we could alternate the focus of the meeting|s^cs.%-
me011|i don't.|s^ar
me011|let's read digits and go.|s^co^t1
me013|why don't we just start with that?|qw^cs
me013|and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics not coming up then we can expand into another meeting.|s^cs
mn017|umm okay.|s^bk
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but i i think that's a great idea.|s^ba
me013|uh so uh um let's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance see what they think and|fh|s^cs.%--
mn017|uhhuh.|b.%
me018|yeah that would be good.|fg|s
me018|i mean andreas and i have various talks in the halls.|s
me018|and there's lots of things you know details and stuff that would i think people would be interested in.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me018|and i'd you know where do we go from here kind of things and|s.%--
me018|so it would be good.|s^r^rt
me013|yeah and you're you're attending the uh the front end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best|s.%--
me013|you and i i guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two.|s
me011|bridge.|s^2
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|we are doing recognition in both of them.|s
me013|so|fh
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|right.|b
me013|uh|fh
mn017|so um|fg
me011|okay.|b
mn017|so so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there's some time.|s^cs^tc
me011|no no that would be for next week.|s^ar
mn017|um i so the latest result was that um|s.%--
mn017|um yot i tested the uh the sort of final version of the p l p configuration um on development test data for for this year's hub five test set.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and the recognition performance was exactly and i mean exactly up to the you know the first decimal same as with the uh mel cepstra front end.|s
me011|huh.|b.%
me018|for both females and males?|qy^bu^rt
mn017|yes.|s^aa
me018|oh!|s^bk^fe
mn017|uh well there was a little bit of a|s^bd.%--
mn017|overall.|s
mn017|they they were the males i think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|i mean definitely not significant.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b.%
me018|uhhuh.|b.%
mn017|and then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half per cent improvement.|s
me011|wow.|b
mn017|so|%-
me011|just with rover?|qy^bu^rt
mn017|with n best rover which is like our new and improved version of rover.|s
me011|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn017|which actually uses the whole n best list from both systems to uh combine that.|s
me013|so except i mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto regressive versus the cepstral truncation.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|b
mn017|and the|%-
me018|but a per cent and a half.|s^rt
me018|that's|%-
me011|yeah it's pretty impressive.|s^ba
mn017|and and so uh after i told the my uh colleagues at s r i about that you know now they definitely want to you know uh have a|s.%--
mn017|next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh you know basically at least the system combination.|s
mn017|um and you know why not?|fh|qh
me013|sure why not?|s^aa|qh^m
mn017|uh so|fh
me011|we clearly got to add a few more features though.|s^cs
mn017|uh what do you mean?|h|qw^bu
mn017|more features in the sense of front end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles?|qr
me011|no uh front end features.|s
me011|you know we did p l p and mel cepstra.|s
me011|let's you know try rasta and m s g and|s.%--
mn017|oh i mean|s.%-
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|well|fg
mn017|right.|b
mn017|so we|s.%--
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|that's the the the|s.%--
mn017|there's one thing uh i mean you don't want to overdo it because every front end|s.%--
mn017|you know if you you know you basically multiply your effort by n where n is a number of different systems.|s
me018|oh.|b.%
me013|uhhuh.|b.%
mn017|and um|fh
mn017|so so one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system.|s
mn017|and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems.|s
mn017|and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um thing.|s
me013|huh.|b
me018|do you think we'd still get the one and a half uh|qy^rt.%--
mn017|so|fh
mn017|i i think so.|s^aa
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower.|s
mn017|and so if|s.%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|you know maybe it's only one per cent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing.|s
mn017|so|fh
mn017|um you know just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely.|s
me011|cool.|s^ba
mn017|and then we had some results on digits uh with um|s^tc.%--
mn017|we we|%--
mn017|so this was uh really really sort of just to get dave going with his um experiments.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|and so uh|s.%--
mn017|but as a result um you know we were sort of wondering why is the hub five system doing so well on the digits.|s
mn017|and the reason is basically there's a whole bunch of read speech data in the hub five training set.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|right.|b
me013|including digits i gather yeah.|s
mn017|and you|s.%-
mn017|and|s.%-
mn017|not all of|s.%--
mn017|no it's actually digits is only a maybe a fifth of it.|s^nd
mn017|the rest is is read is read timit data and uh atis data and wall street journal and stuff like that.|s
me013|a fifth of it is how much?|qw
me013|right.|fg
me013|but a a fifth is how much?|qw^r
mn017|a fifth would be maybe uh two hours something.|s
me013|yeah so i mean that's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|but it definitely helps to have the other read data in there.|s
me013|so|fh
mn017|because we're doing|s.%--
me013|oh yeah?|qy^bh^d
mn017|you know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on uh timit uh not timit uh t i digits.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|which is only what?|qw
mn017|two hours something?|qy^bu^rt
me013|right.|b
me011|i don't know.|s^no
mn017|so uh more read speech data definitely helps.|s
mn017|and you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty.|s
mn017|that's|%-
me013|yeah that was the interesting thing.|s
mn017|that was|%-
me013|because because uh it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better.|s
mn017|right right.|b
me013|but but uh|fh
mn017|right.|b
me018|well is there even more read speech data around?|qy^rt
mn017|oh yeah.|s^bk
mn017|so we only for the hub five training we're only using uh a fairly small subset of the macrophone data base.|s^na
me018|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn017|um so you could beef that up and probably do even better.|fh|s^cs
me011|i could also put in uh focus condition zero from hub four from broadcast news which is mostly prepared speech.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b.%
me011|it's not exactly read speech but it's pretty darn close.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|well i mean that's plenty of read speech data.|s
mn017|i mean wall street journal uh take one example.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me011|that's right.|b
mn017|but um|%--
mn017|so you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than t i digits.|s
me011|yeah.|b.%
me013|well they been using timit.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me013|that|s.%--
me013|uh they they uh they experimented for a while with a bunch of different data bases with french and spanish and so forth because they're multi lingual tests.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|and and uh um and actually the best results they got were uh using timit.|s
me011|huh.|b
me013|uh but uh which so that's what they're they're using now.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|but but yeah certainly if we um|s.%--
me013|if we knew what the structure of what we're doing there was.|s
me013|i mean there's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so we don't know exactly which combination we're going to be going with.|s
me013|once we know then the trainable parts of it it'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|well that was that.|s^tc
mn017|and then i guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system.|s^tc
mn017|and you want to you want to see where that stands?|qy^cs^d
me018|well i'm|s.%-
me018|yeah so andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the s r i system uses.|s
me018|and so i'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with.|s
me018|and uh so then i'll train the net.|s
me018|and|s.%-
mn017|and one side effect of that would be that it's um that the phone set would change.|s
me018|right.|b
mn017|so the m l p would be trained on i think only forty six or forty eight|s.%--
me018|eight.|s^bc
mn017|forty eight phones.|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we've been using so far.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and that that that will probably help actually.|s
me018|so it's a little different.|s
mn017|because um the fewer dimensions uh the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um um|s.%--
mn017|just|s.%--
mn017|you know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features.|s
mn017|and so you have to multiply everything by two or three.|s
mn017|and so you know fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view.|s
me013|sure.|fg
me013|although we i mean it's not that many fewer and and and we take a k l t anyway so we could|s.%-
mn017|right.|fg
mn017|exactly.|fg
mn017|so so that was the other thing.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|and then we wanted to just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front end.|s
mn017|so that would mean just doing the top i don't know ten or twelve or something of the k l t dimensions.|s
me013|yeah and i think and we again check we should check with stephane.|s^cs
me013|my impression was that when we did that before that had very little uh he didn't lose very much.|s
mn017|right.|b
me018|by just taking the top whatever?|qy^bu^d
me011|yep.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|but then|s.%--
mn017|and then something|s.%--
mn017|once we have the new m l p trained up uh one thing i wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know those features.|s
mn017|uh and uh retrain m l p and also the you know the dictionary that we use for the hub five system.|fh|s
me013|and the and the base starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from from a pretty decent system.|s
mn017|exactly.|s^bk
me018|right.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|so that would basically give us a um more hopefully a a better system.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|um because you know compared to what eric did a while ago where he trained up i think a system based on broadcast news.|fh|s
mn017|and then uh retraining it on switchboard.|s
mn017|or uh and|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|but he i think he he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available.|s
mn017|and his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as as the as ours is.|s
mn017|so|s.%-
me013|that's that's certainly one thing yeah.|s^ba
mn017|and the dictionary made a huge difference.|s
me013|uh yeah.|b
mn017|uh we we made some improvements to the dictionary's uh to the dictionary about two years ago.|fh|s
mn017|which resulted in a uh something like a four per cent absolute error rate reduction on switchboard.|s
mn017|which|%-
me013|well the other thing is dipping deep into history and into uh our resource management days when we were collaborating with s r i before.|s^rt
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|s
me013|uh it was i think it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment.|fh|s
me013|when we were working together we got our initial alignments from decipher uh at the time.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|uh and later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems.|fh|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|because they were consistent.|s
me013|but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty per cent error uh rate.|s
me013|uh but that was a that was a good good good way to start.|fh|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|okay.|b
me013|and we're not quite that bad with our our switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as s r i's.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|so|s.%-
me018|what is the performance on the best switchboard system that we've done?|qw
mn017|right.|b
me018|roughly?|qw^e
me013|well the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty per cent error.|s
me013|and uh it was|s.%--
me013|i think there's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for.|s
me013|we never did really fix up the dictionary.|s
me013|uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were going to do.|s
me013|and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|but that|s.%-
me013|uh we never did never did any adaptation.|s
mn017|even that that number|s.%-
mn017|right.|fg
me013|uh we never did any|fh|s.%-
mn017|and and that number i think was on switchboard one data.|s
mn017|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|where the error rate now is in the twenties.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|so um|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so we were|s.%--
mn017|that's yet|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|we were probably at least a factor or two off.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|so it would be so it would be good to sort of uh|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|but i think again it's|s.%--
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|it's the it's the conversational speech bit.|s
me013|because our our broadcast news system is actually pretty good.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|he knows.|s
mn017|right.|s^bk
mn017|and the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the m l p is trained up.|s
mn017|right?|qy^d^g
mn017|because it's a pretty good um indicator of that.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn017|so it's sort of a sanity check of the m l p outputs before we go ahead and train up the uh you know use them as a basis for the tandem system.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|it'll still probably be worse.|s
me013|i mean it's it'd be context independent and so on.|s
mn017|no.|s^ar
mn017|sure.|s^aa
me018|should we should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training?|qy^rt
mn017|not|%-
mn017|but|%-
me013|but|%-
me018|i mean should should we even use that?|qy^rt
mn017|oh oh that's a good question.|s^bk
me018|or should i just go straight to|qrr.%-
mn017|yeah we we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments um from the s r i recognizer.|h|s^no
mn017|or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign.|s
me011|try it.|s^co
me011|you run it.|s^co^rt
me011|keep keep both versions.|s^co^rt
me011|see which one's better.|s^co
me013|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
me013|i mean i think i agree with|s.%--
me013|i mean basically you would then you proceed with the embedded training.|s^cs
mn017|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|it's going to take you a while to train at this net anyway.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|and while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did.|s^cs
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me018|huh.|b
mn017|all right.|b
me011|i could make arguments either way.|s
mn017|but but so i|s.%-
me011|you know it's|%-
mn017|well but|%-
me011|sort of given up guessing.|s
mn017|but in your experience i mean uh have you seen big improvements in on some tasks with embedded training?|qy^rt
mn017|or was it sort of smallish uh improvements that you got?|qrr
me013|uh well it depended on the task.|fh|s
me013|i mean i think in this one i would sort of expect it to be important.|s
mn017|right.|b
me013|because we're coming from uh alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system.|s^df
mn017|that are from another|s^2.%-
mn017|right.|b
mn017|right.|b
me011|although i mean we've done it with when we were combining with the cambridge recurrent neural net embedded training made it worse.|s
me013|uh|fh
me011|which i've never figured out.|s
me013|right.|s^aa
me013|but i mean|s^arp.%-
me011|i think it's a bug.|s
mn017|so you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the cambridge uh system?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|yep.|s^aa
mn017|and then|s.%--
mn017|uh uh|fh
me011|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|fg
mn017|well that might probably just|s.%--
mn017|huh.|fh
mn017|that was probably because your initial system i mean your system was worse than cambridge's.|s
mn017|and you um|%-
me013|was it?|qy^bu^rt
me013|i don't think it was.|s^ng
me011|no.|s^aa
me011|they were they were comparable.|s^e^nd
mn017|it wasn't?|qy^bh
me013|no.|s^aa
mn017|really?|qy^bh
me011|they were very close.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|that's weird.|s^ba
me013|excuse me?|qw^bu^rt
mn017|that's that's weird.|s^r^rt
mn017|no i mean it's weird that it did|s^df.%-
me013|oh!|s^fe
me011|that's what i said.|s
mn017|i'm sorry.|s^fa
mn017|it's|s.%--
mn017|it's weird that it got worse.|s
me018|that's ambiguous.|s
me013|um no.|fh|s^ba
me013|uh we've i mean and with the numbers o g i numbers task we've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better.|fh|s
mn017|oh actually it's not that weird.|s
mn017|because we have seen|s^df.%--
mn017|we have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|it just|s.%-
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|but i but i would i would suspect that something that that had um a very different um feature set for instance.|s
me013|i mean they were using pretty similar feature sets to us.|s
me011|yep.|b
me013|i i would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me018|what about uh hidden unit size on this?|qw
me013|oh wait a minute.|s^co
me013|and the other thing uh|s.%--
me018|oh.|b
me013|sorry.|s^fa^t3
me013|it was the other thing is that what was in common to the cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|so i mean uh that's another pretty big difference.|s
me011|uh yeah.|b
me011|that's another big difference.|s
me013|and uh one at least|s.%-
me013|back at|s.%-
mn017|you mean with soft targets?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|or|qrr.%--
mn017|sorry i'm|s^fa.%--
mn017|i missed|s.%--
mn017|what what's the key issue here?|qw^rt
me013|oh that uh both the cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors.|s
me013|and if we're we're coming from alignments coming from the s r i system it's a likelihood based system.|s
me013|so so that's another difference.|s
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|i mean you know there's different front end different different uh um training criterion.|s
me013|uh i would think that in that an embedded uh embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more.|fh|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|but we don't know.|s^no
mn017|okay.|b
me013|you going to say something?|qy^d^rt^tc
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me018|i was wondering uh you know what size net i should|s^r.%--
me018|anybody have any intuitions or suggestions?|qo
me013|uh how much training data?|qw^rt
me018|well i was going to start off with the small train set.|s
me013|and how how many hours is that?|qw^rt
me018|that's why i was|s.%--
me018|i i'm not sure how much that is.|s^no
mn017|uh i think that has about|fg|s.%--
mn017|well you'd would be gender dependent training.|s^bu
mn017|right?|qy^d^g
me018|gender dependent yeah.|s^aa^m
mn017|so so i think it's uh that's about huh something like thirty hours.|s
me018|thirty hours?|qy^d^m^rt
mn017|thirty hours per gender.|s^aa^e
me011|i'm not sure what this'll mean.|s^no.x
me018|in the small training set?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|hello?|qo^rt^t3
mn017|i i think so.|s^aa
mn017|i'll|%--
me011|excuse me?|qw^br^rt^t3
mn017|it's definitely less than a hundred.|s
mn017|you know it's more like like thirty forty hours.|s
me011|all right.|s^bk^t3
mn017|something like that.|s
me011|wrong number.|s^t3
me018|they called to tell us that?|qy^d^rt
mn017|yeah.|b.%
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|um so uh after run|fg|s.%-
me018|i mean i didn't want to do too big.|s
me013|right.|s^bk
me018|just|%--
me013|so|s.%--
me013|at least a couple thousand hidden units.|s
me013|i mean|s.%--
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|it's it's the thing i'll i'll think about it a little more.|s
me013|but it it'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|you definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand.|s^cs
me013|it's it's more than|s.%-
me018|and a thousand is too small?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|oh let me think about it.|h
me013|but i think that that uh at some point there's diminishing returns.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean it doesn't actually get worse typically.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|but it but but there is diminishing returns.|s^e
me013|and you're doubling the amount of time.|s
mn017|remember you'll have a smaller output layer so there's going to be fewer parameters there.|s
me011|but not by a lot.|s^arp
me013|not by much.|s^arp
mn017|and then|%-
me013|fifty fifty four to forty eight?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|vast majority is from the input unit.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|it'll have a very tiny effect.|s
me011|right because you used the context windows.|s^aa|s
me011|and so the input to hidden is much much larger.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|oh i see.|s^bk
mn017|i see.|s^bk
mn017|yeah of course.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah.|b.%
mn017|it's negligible okay.|s^bs|s^bk
me013|yeah so it's it'd be way way less than ten per cent of the difference.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh there's uh|fh|s.%--
me013|how how big|qw.%-
me013|let's see.|h
me013|what am i trying to think of?|qw^t1
me018|the the net that that we did use already uh was eight thousand hidden units.|s
me018|and that's the one that eric trained up.|s
me013|right.|s^bk
me013|and that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of of speech.|s
mn017|was that gender dependent or independent?|qrr
me018|gender dependent.|s
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|so that would be like trained on sixty or seventy hours.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|so uh|fh
me013|yeah definitely not the one thousand uh two thousand|s.%--
me013|i mean the four thousand will be better.|s
me013|and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good.|s
me011|it'll be faster.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|so|fh
me018|maybe i'll start off with two thousand just to see.|s
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn017|okay.|b
me018|okay.|b
me013|yeah thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds.|fg|s
me013|uh so that's like eleven eleven million frames.|fh|s
me013|and a two thousand hidden unit net is uh i guess about seven eight hundred thousand parameters.|s
me013|so that's probably that's probably fine.|s
me013|i mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from.|s
me013|but the two thousand would be faster.|s
me013|so|fh
mn017|right.|fg
mn017|i actually have to go.|s

fe016|that's good.|z
fe008|ear plug.|z
me018|is that a wireless?|z

me018|oh.|z
me051|it's wired.|z
me013|oh!|z
fe008|is that does that mean you can't hear anything during the meeting?|z
me001|it's old school.|z
me011|huh what huh?|z
me013|should we uh close the door maybe?|z
me011|it it's a fairly good mike actually.|z

me013|was that sort of the division?|qy^rt
me013|so which week are we in?|qw
me011|well we haven't really started.|s

me011|so i thought we could do uh|s^cs.%-
me013|i thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too.|s^arp

me018|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|so|fh
me011|i seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted.|s^t3
me011|here we go.|s^t3
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|so uh as most of you should know i did send out the consent form thingies.|s
me011|and uh|fh
me011|so far no one has made any ach any comments on them.|s
me011|so no no one has bleeped out anything.|s
me013|um yeah|fg
me011|so|fh
me011|i don't expect anyone to.|s
me011|but.|fh
me013|so what follows|qw.%--
me013|at some point you go around and get people to sign something?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|no.|s^ar
me011|we had spoken about this before.|s
me011|and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once.|s
me013|yeah but i've forgotten.|s^aa|s^df
me011|and the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity.|s
me011|so as long as we do that we're covered.|s
me013|and how long of an opportunity did you tell them?|qw^rt
me011|uh july fifteenth.|s
me013|july fifteenth.|s^bk^m
me013|oh so they have plenty of time.|s^bk|s^ba
me011|yep.|s^aa
me013|and|%-
me013|given that it's that long|s.%--
me013|um um|fh
me013|why was that date chosen?|qw^rt
me013|you just felt you wanted to|s^bu.%-
me011|jane told me july fifteenth.|s^rt
me011|so that's what i set it.|s
me013|oh okay.|s^bk
fe008|oh i just meant that that was the release date that you had on the data.|s^bd^df
me011|oh i i didn't understand that there was something specific.|s^bk|s
fe008|i uh|%-
fe008|i thought|%-
me011|you you had|%--
me013|i don't|%-
me011|i had heard july fifteenth.|s^df
me011|so that's what i put.|s
me013|no the only the only mention i recall about that was just that july fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts.|s^ar|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|so|fh
fe008|that's right.|s^aa
fe008|that's why.|s^na
me013|oh i see.|s^bk
fe008|you said you wanted it to be available then.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|right.|s^bk
fe008|i didn't mean it to be the hard deadline.|s^bd
fe008|it's fine with me if it is.|s
fe008|or we|s^cs.%-
fe008|but i thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that.|s
fe008|in case uh you know by the way this is your last|s.%-
me013|right.|s^bk
fe008|uh yeah|fh
me013|we probably should have talked about it.|s^cs
me013|because because if we want to be able to give it to people july fifteenth|s^df.%--
me013|if somebody's going to come back and say okay i don't want this and this and this used uh clearly we need some time to respond to that.|s^bu:s
me013|right?|qy^d^f^rt
me011|yeah as i said we i just got one date.|s^aa|s^df
mn017|damn!|s^fe
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me011|and that's the one i used.|s
me011|so but i can send a follow up.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
me011|i mean it's almost all us.|s^df
me011|i mean the people who are in the this meeting was uh these the meetings that in are in set one.|s
me018|was my was my response okay?|qy^rt
fe008|that's right.|s^aa
me018|i just wrote you replied to the email saying they're all fine.|s
me011|right i mean that's fine.|s^bk|s^ba^na
me018|okay good.|s^bk
me011|i we don't my understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that uh we don't actually need a reply.|s
me018|that makes it easy.|s^ba
me011|we just need to tell them that they can do it if they want.|s^e
me013|okay.|b
me013|i just didn't remember.|s^df^no
me013|but|fh
me011|and so no reply is no changes.|s
fe008|and he's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is okay.|s
me013|okay.|b
fe008|so that's very clear.|s
fe008|all the way down the page okay.|s
fe008|and they have two options.|s
fe008|they can change it to one of them is censor and the other one is incorrect.|s
fe008|is it is your word is incorrect?|qh
me011|right.|b
fe008|which means also we get feedback on if um there's something that they that needs to be adjusted.|s
fe008|because i mean these are very highly technical things.|s^df^rt
fe008|i mean it's an added uh level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription as i see it.|s
fe008|but in any case people can agree to things that are wrong.|s
me011|well|fg
fe008|so|fh
me011|yeah the reason i did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly.|fg|s
fe008|and the reason i liked it was because|s.%-
me011|as opposed to uh|s.%-
fe008|was because it um it gives them the option of uh being able to correct it.|s
me011|right.|s^bk
fe008|approve it and correct it.|s
fe008|and um|fh
fe008|so you have it nicely set up so they email you.|s
fe008|and uh|%-
me011|when they submit the form it gets processed and emailed to me.|s^aap
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|fg
me011|so|fh
fe008|and i wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are robustness and meeting recorder.|s^rt
fe008|the german ones will be ready for next week.|s
fe008|those are three three of those.|s
fe008|a different set of people.|s
fe008|and we can impose|s^cs.%-
me018|the german ones?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|uh well|%-
mn017|yeah those uh|s^aa|%-
me013|n s a.|s
fe008|okay i spoke loosely.|s^bk|s^bd
fe008|the the german french sorry the german dutch and spanish ones.|s
fe016|spanish|s.%-
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|uhhuh.|b
me018|oh those are the n s a meetings?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|those are|%-
fe016|the non native|s.%-
fe008|yeah uhhuh.|s^aa
me018|oh oh okay.|s^bk
me013|german dutch swiss and spanish.|s
fe016|the all non native|s^r.%-
fe008|that's that's that's|%-
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me018|okay i'd i|s^bk|%-
fe008|yeah it's the other group.|s^bk|s
me013|it was the network network services group.|s
me018|okay.|s^bk
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|yeah exactly yeah.|s^aa
fe008|i didn't mean to isolate them.|s^bd
me013|otherwise known as the german dutch and spanish.|s^j
fe008|yeah sorry.|s^bk|s^fa
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|it was it was not the best characterization.|s^ba^bd
fe008|but what what i meant to say was that it's the other group that's not no no overlap with our present members.|s
fe008|and then maybe it'd be good to set an explicit deadline.|s
fe008|something like a week before that.|s
fe008|uh july fifteenth date.|s
fe008|or two weeks before.|s
me013|i mean i would suggest we discuss|s^cs.%--
me013|i mean if we're going to have a policy on it|s^df.%--
me013|that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people.|s^cs
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|so that we have a uniform thing.|s^df
me013|so that's a month.|s
me013|which is fine.|s^ba
me018|twelve hours.|s
me011|well the only thing i said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth.|s
me013|i mean it seems|%-
me011|i didn't give any other deadline.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|s^bk
me011|so my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says wow i suddenly found something we'll delete it from our record.|s:s
me011|we just won't delete it from whatever's already been released.|s
fe008|huh that's a little bit difficult.|s^ba
me011|what else can we do?|qo
fe008|yeah.|s^bk
me011|if someone says hey look i found something in this meeting and it's libelous and i want it removed what can we do?|qo:s
me011|we have to remove it.|s^df
fe008|well that's true.|s^aa
fe008|i i agree with that part.|s^aap
fe008|but i think that it would it uh we need to have uh a a a message to them very clearly that beyond this date you can't make additional changes.|s^cs
me013|i mean|s.%--
me013|um|fh
me013|i i i i think that somebody might request something.|s
me013|even though we say that.|s^rt
me013|but i think it's good to at least start some place like that.|s^df
me013|so if we agreed okay how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have?|qw
fe008|uhhuh good.|b
me013|if we say two weeks or if we say a month|s.%--
me013|i think we should just say that|s^cs.%--
me013|say that you know as um per the the the uh page you signed you have the ability to look over this stuff and so forth.|s^cs:s
me013|and uh because we these uh|s.%--
me013|i would i would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say because we uh will continually be making these things available to other researchers uh this can't be open ended.|s^cs
me013|and so uh uh please give us back your response within this you know within this amount of time whatever time we agree upon.|s^cs
me011|well did you read the email and look at the pages i sent?|qy^rt
me013|did i?|qy^rt^t1
me013|no i haven't yet.|s
me011|no okay well why don't you do that?|s^bk|qh^cs
me013|no just|%-
me011|and then make comments on what you want me to change.|s^cs
me013|no no i'm not saying that you should change anything.|s^ar|s
me013|i'm what i'm what i'm i'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it.|s
me013|so that that you can you can uh decide on something.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i'm not telling you what to decide.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|i'm just saying you should decide something.|s^df
me011|i already did decide something.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me013|and then|%-
me011|and that's what's in the email.|s
fe008|yeah yeah okay so|fg
me011|and if you disagree with it why don't you read it and give me comments on it?|qo^cs
fe008|yeah.|b
fe008|well|fg
fe008|i i think that there's one missing line.|s
me013|well the one thing that i did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of july fifteenth.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|and you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
me013|so what i'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough.|s^cs
me013|and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere.|s^cs
me013|that's all i'm saying.|s^bd
me011|okay.|s^bk^rt
me013|okay.|s^bk
fe008|i i have one question.|s
fe008|this is in the summer period.|s
fe008|and presumably people may be out of town.|s
fe008|but we can make the assumption can't we that um they will be receiving email uh most of the month.|s^bu
fe008|right?|qy^d^g
fe008|because if someone|s^df.%-
me013|it well it well you're right sometimes somebody will be away.|s
me013|and uh you know there's uh for any length of time that you uh choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|that's it's you know just a certain risk to take.|s
mn017|so maybe when|s.%-
mn017|am i on by the way?|qy^rt
me011|i don't know.|s^no^rt
mn017|oh.|s^bk
me011|you should be.|s^am
mn017|hello hello?|qh
me011|you should be channel b.|s
mn017|oh okay all right so the|s^bk|%-
mn017|um|fh
mn017|maybe we should say in|s^cs.%--
mn017|you know when the whole thing starts when they sign the agreement that|s^cs.%--
mn017|you know specify exactly uh what you know how how they will be contacted.|s^cs
mn017|and they can you know they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address or both.|s
mn017|and um then|%-
fe008|we did that i i believe.|s^na
mn017|right.|s^bk
mn017|so and then you know say very clearly that if they don't if we don't hear from them you know as morgan suggested by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement.|fg|s
fe016|yeah.|b
me011|well they've already signed a form.|s
mn017|right.|s^bk
fe008|and the form says|s.%-
fe016|and nobody nobody really reads it anyway.|s
me011|so|fh
me011|and the and the form was approved by human subjects.|s^df
mn017|says that.|s
mn017|right.|b
mn017|well if that's if that's already if|s.%-
fe008|uh the|%-
me011|so uh that's going to be a little hard to modify.|s^ba
fe008|well the form well the form doesn't say if uh you know if you don't respond by x number of days or x number of weeks|s.%-:s.%-
mn017|i see.|s^bk
mn017|uh|fh
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
mn017|so what does it say about the the the process of of uh the review process?|qw
fe008|it doesn't have a time limit.|s
fe008|that you'll be provided access to the transcripts.|s^rt
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
fe008|and then uh allowed to remove things that you'd like to remove before it goes to the general uh larger audience.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|right.|b
mn017|oh.|s^bk
me011|here.|s
me011|you can read what you already signed.|s
fe008|there you go.|s
fe016|i guess when i read it um|s.%--
mn017|okay.|s^bk
fe016|i'm not as diligent as chuck.|s
fe016|but i had the feeling i should probably respond.|s
fe016|and tell adam like i got this and i will do it by this date.|s:s
fe016|and if you don't hear from me by then you know in other words responding to your email once right away saying as soon as you get this could you please respond.|s^cs:s
me011|right.|s^bk
fe016|and then if you if the person thinks they'll need more time because they're out of town or whatever they can tell you at that point.|s^cs^rt
fe016|because|%-
me011|oh i just i didn't want to do that.|s^nd
me011|because i don't want to have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it.|s^df
fe016|well it's|%-
me011|so what i wanted to do was just send it out.|s^cs
me011|and say on the fifteenth the data is released.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me011|if you want to do something about it do something about it.|s
me011|but that's it.|s
fe008|i i kind of like this.|s^ba
fe016|well|%-
fe016|okay so we're assuming that|s^bk|s.%-
fe008|yeah.|b
mn017|well that's that would be great if|s.%--
mn017|but you should probably have a legal person look at this.|s^cs
mn017|and make sure it's okay.|s^e
mn017|because if you if you uh do this and you then there's a dispute later and uh some you know someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have uh you know enough opportunity to actually exercise their their right|s^df.%-
fe016|or they they might never have gotten the email.|s
fe016|because although they signed this they don't know by which date to expect your email.|s^df
fe016|and so someone whose machine is down or whatever|s.%--
fe016|i mean we have no|s.%--
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|internally we know that people are there.|s
me011|well okay let me let me reverse this.|s^bk|s^cs
fe016|but we have no confirmation that they got the mail.|s
me011|so let's say someone i send this out.|s
me011|and someone doesn't respond.|s^rt
me011|do we delete every meeting that they were in?|qy^rt
me011|i don't think so.|s
fe016|well then|%-
mn017|no.|s^ar
fe016|it we're hoping that doesn't happen.|s
fe016|but that's why there's such a thing as registered mail.|s
me011|that will happen.|s
fe016|or|%-
mn017|that will happen.|s^m^na
me011|that will absolutely happen.|s^r
fe016|right.|b
me011|because people don't read their email.|s^df
me011|or they'll read and say i don't care about that.|s:s
me011|i'm not going to delete anything.|s
me011|and they just won't reply to it.|s
mn017|maybe uh do we have mailing addresses for these people?|qy^rt
me011|no.|s^ar
mn017|no.|s^bk^m
me011|we have what they put on the speaker form.|s
mn017|oh.|s^bk
me011|which was just generic contact information.|s
fe008|most|%-
fe008|but the ones that we're dealing with now are all local.|s
mn017|well then|%-
fe008|except the ones who|s.%--
fe008|i mean we we're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups.|s
mn017|huh.|b
mn017|okay.|s^bk
fe008|so maybe uh i you know that's not that many people.|s^ba
fe008|and if i if uh|%--
fe008|there is an advantage to having them admit.|s
fe008|and if i can help with with processing that i will.|s
fe008|it's it's there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating|s^df.%-
me011|yeah i mean i thought we had discussed this like a year ago.|fg|s^df
fe008|yes we did.|s^na
me011|and so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again.|s
fe008|you're right.|s^na
fe008|well i you know but sometimes|s.%-
me013|well we we haven't experienced it before.|s
me011|so|fh
fe008|that's right.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|so|fh
fe016|you'll either wonder at the beginning or you'll wonder at the end.|s
fe008|need to get it right.|s
fe016|i mean there's no way to get around|s.%--
fe016|it's pretty much the same amount of work.|s
fe016|except for an additional email just saying they got the email.|s
fe008|yeah.|b
fe016|and maybe it's better legally to wonder before|s^am^cs.%--
fe016|you know a little bit earlier than|s.%-
me011|well|fg
fe008|it's much easier to explain this way.|s
me011|okay well why don't you talk|fg|qh^cs.%--
fe008|to have it on record.|s
me011|morgan can you talk to our lawyer about it?|qy^rt
me011|and find out what the status is on this.|s^e
me011|because i don't want to do something that we don't need to.|s^df
fe008|yeah but huh|fg|%-
me011|because|%--
me011|what i'm telling you people won't respond to the email.|s
me011|no matter what you do there're going to be people who you're going to have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with.|s
me001|i mean it's|%-
mn017|huh.|b
fe008|well then we make the effort.|s
me011|and do we want to spend that effort?|qh
me001|it's kind of like signing up for a mailing list.|s
fe008|we make the effort.|s^r
me001|they have opt in and opt out.|s
me001|and there are two different ways.|s
me001|i mean and either way works.|s
me001|probably i mean.|s^bd
fe008|except i really think in this case|s^arp.%--
fe008|i i'm i agree with liz that we need to be in the clear.|s
fe008|and not have to after the fact say oh but i assumed|s.%--:s.%--
fe008|and oh i'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you.|s:s
me013|if this is a purely administrative task we can actually have administration do it.|s^cs
fe008|you know.|s^f
fe008|oh excellent.|s^ba
me013|but the thing is that you know i i i think without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers from my previous conversations with them my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this.|s
fe008|yes.|b
me011|well we had talked about this before.|s
me011|and i thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|and they said you have to they've already signed away the with that form.|s
me011|that they've already signed once.|s
fe008|i don't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered.|s^no
me011|yeah.|b
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah we never really talked about that.|s^aa|s^na
fe016|or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you.|s^2
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|or or how they would indicate|s^2.%-
fe016|they probably forgot all about it.|s
me013|we certainly didn't talk uh about with them at all about uh the manner of them being made the uh uh materials available.|s
fe016|yeah.|b
mn017|we do it like with these|s.%-
me013|that was something that was sort of just within our implementation.|s
mn017|we can use it we can use a a ploy.|s^cs
me011|okay.|b
mn017|like they use to um|s.%--
mn017|you know that when they serve like|s.%--
mn017|uh uh uh uh|fh
mn017|you know like dead beat dads.|s
mn017|they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery.|s
mn017|and then they open the envelope.|s
mn017|and that|%-
me001|and they're served.|s^2
mn017|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn017|because and then the the the the thing is served.|s^rt
mn017|so you just make it you know oh you won.|s:s^fe
mn017|you know go to this web site.|s
mn017|and you've uh you're|%-
fe016|that's why you never open these things that come in the mail.|s^j
fe008|that one.|s^j
me013|yeah.|b
me011|well it's just we've gone from one extreme to the other where at one point a few months ago morgan was you were saying let's not do anything.|s
mn017|right no i it might|fg|%-
fe008|well it doesn't matter.|s^ba
mn017|it it might well be the case|s.%-
me011|and now we're|s.%-
mn017|it might|%-
me011|we're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature.|s^bu^rt
mn017|right.|b
me011|i mean what are we going to doing here?|qw
mn017|it might well be the case that that this is perfectly you know this is enough to give us a basis to just uh assume their consent if they don't reply.|s
me013|well|%-
me011|uhhuh.|b
mn017|but i'm not you know me not being a lawyer i wouldn't just want to do that without having the the expert uh opinion on that.|s^df
fe008|and how many people|qw.%--
me011|then i think we had better find out.|s^cs
fe008|altogether we've got twenty people these people are people who read their email almost all the time.|s
me011|so that we can find a|s^df.%-
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me013|let me look at this again.|s^cc
me011|right.|s^aa
fe008|i i really don't see that it's a problem.|s^ba
fe008|i i think that it's a common courtesy to ask them uh to expect for them to uh be able to have us try to contact them.|s^cs
me011|for for|%-
fe008|just in case they hadn't gotten their email.|s
fe008|i think they'd appreciate it.|s
me013|yeah my adam my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation.|fg|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|of of how my my|%--
me013|the things that we're questioning were along the lines of how easy|qh.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|how how much implication would there be that it's likely you're going to be changing something as opposed to|qh.%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|that was the kind of dispute i was making before.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|i remember that.|s^bk
me013|but um the attorneys i uh i can guarantee you the attorneys will always come back with|s.%--
me013|and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things.|s
me013|but they will always come back with saying that um you need to you want to have some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have uh in fact okay'd it.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|so um|fh
me013|i think that if you if we send the email as you have.|s^cs
me013|and if there's half the people say who don't respond at all by you know some period of time we can just make a list of these people.|s^cs
me013|and hand it to uh|s.%--
me013|you know just give it to me.|s
me013|and i'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever.|s
me011|right.|b
me013|and they'll just call them up and say you know have you|s.%--
me013|is is this okay and would you please mail you know mail adam that it is if if it you know is or not.|s^cs:s
me013|so you know we can we can do that.|s
fe016|the other thing that there's a psychological effect that at least for most people that if they've responded to your email saying yes i will do it or yes i got your email they're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and of course we don't want them to bleep things out.|s
fe016|but it it's a little bit better if we're getting the their uh final response once they've answered you once than if they never answer you'd at at all.|s
fe016|that's how these mailing houses work.|s
fe016|so i mean it's not completely lost work.|s
fe016|because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|you know an official okay from somebody is better than no answer even if they responded that they got your email.|s
fe016|and they're probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email.|s
fe008|i also think they'd just simply appreciate it.|s
fe008|i think it's a good a good way of of fostering goodwill among our subjects.|s^e
fe008|well our participants.|s^bsc
me013|i think the main thing is i mean what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases.|s
me011|sending lots of spam.|s
me013|so they so so that's what they're paid to do.|s
me011|yep.|s^aa
me013|and so it is certainly possible that uh somebody's server would be down or something.|s
me013|and they wouldn't actually hear from us.|s
me013|and then they find this thing is in there.|s
me013|and we've already distributed it to someone.|s
me013|so what it says in there in fact is that they will be given an opportunity to blah blah blah.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
me013|but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason um then we haven't given them that.|s
me011|well so how far do we have to go?|fg|qw
me011|do we need to get someone's signature?|qy^rt
me011|or is email enough?|qrr
me011|do we have to have it notarized?|qy^j^rt
me013|email is enough.|s^na
me011|i mean|fh
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|i mean i've been through this|s^df.%--
me013|i mean i'm not a lawyer.|s^bd
me013|but i've been through these things a things like this a few times with lawyers now.|s^df
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i i i'm pretty comfortable with that.|s^df
me018|do you track um when people log in?|qy^tc
me018|to look at the|s^e.%--
me011|uh if they submit the form i get it.|h|s^na
me018|uhhuh.|b
me011|if they don't submit the form it goes in the general web log.|s
me011|but that's not sufficient.|s
me018|huh|b
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|because if someone just visits the web site that doesn't imply anything in particular.|s^df
me018|except that you know they got the mail.|s^2^aap
fe008|uhhuh that's right.|s^aa
me011|right.|s^aa
fe008|i i could get you on the notify list if you want me to.|s^cs
me011|i'm already on it.|s^ng
fe008|for that directory?|qy^bu^d
me011|uhhuh.|s^aa
fe008|okay great.|s^bk
me013|so again hopefully um this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way.|s
me013|uh in any of the extremes we've talked about.|s
me013|because uh we're talking a pretty small number of people.|s^df
me011|for this set i'm not worried.|s
me011|because we basically know everyone on it.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|huh|%-
me013|uhhuh.|b
me011|you know they're all more or less here.|s
me011|or it's it's eric and dan and so on.|s
me011|but for some of the others you're talking about visitors who are gone from icsi whose email addresses may or may not work.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|oh.|b
me011|and|fh
me011|so what are we going to do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with?|qw
fe008|i don't think uh they're so recent these visitors.|s
fe008|i and and i they're also so|%--
me011|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|they're prominent enough that they're easy to find through|s.%--
fe008|i i mean i i i'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them i really think i could find them.|s
me011|other methods?|qy^2^bu^d^rt
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah because it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission.|fg|s^df
me013|um and i think you know if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they're not there it doesn't seem that|s.%--
me013|that's the intent of uh meaning here.|s
me013|so|fh
me011|well the the question is just whether how active it has to be.|s
me011|i mean because they they filled out a contact information.|s
me011|and that's where i'm sending the information.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|and so far everyone has done email.|s
me011|there isn't anyone who did uh any other contact method.|s
me013|well the way icsi goes people uh who uh were here ten years ago still have have forwards to other accounts and so on.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me013|so it's unusual that that they uh|%--
me011|so my original impression was that that was sufficient.|s
me011|that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that we fulfilled our burden.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|then they just come back.|s^2
me018|all my files were still here.|s
fe016|same as us.|s
fe008|i just|%-
me013|so if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it.|s
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me011|okay.|s^bk
me013|but you know hopefully we won't need to.|s
fe008|i i just don't think we will.|s
me011|all right.|s^bk^rt
fe008|for all the reasons that we've discussed.|s
me013|so we'll we'll see if we do or not.|s
me011|yep and we'll see how many people respond to that email.|fg|s^cc
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|so far two people have.|s
me013|yeah i think very few people will.|fg|s
me011|so|fh
me013|and and and you know people people see long emails about things that they don't think is going to be high priority they typically uh don't don't read it or half read it.|s
me011|right.|s^aa
me013|because people are swamped.|s^df
me013|but|fh
fe008|and actually|s.%--
fe008|um i i didn't anticipate this.|fh|s^df
fe008|so i that's why i didn't give this comment.|s^df
fe008|and it i this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow up email within the next couple of days saying by the way you know we want to hear back from you by x date.|s^cs:s
fe008|and please|s^cs.%--:s.%--
fe008|and then add what liz said.|s^cs
fe008|please uh respond to please indicate you received this mail.|s:s
me013|uh or well maybe even additionally uh um|s.%--
me013|even if you've decided you have no changes you'd like to make if you could tell us that.|s^cs
me011|respond to the email yep.|s^2^cs|s^aa
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe016|right that would that would definitely work on me.|s^aa|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|it is the first time through the cycle.|s
fe016|you know it makes you feel like|s.%--
fe016|um|fh
fe016|if you were going to if you're predicting that you might not answer you have a chance now to say that.|s
fe016|whereas i i mean i would be much more likely myself|s.%--
me018|and the other|%-
fe016|given all my email to respond at that point saying you know what i'm probably not going to get to it or whatever.|s:s
fe016|rather than just having seen the email thinking i might get to it.|s
fe016|and never really uh pushing myself to actually do it until it's too late.|s
me018|yeah i was|%-
me018|i was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this.|s
fe016|right right that's true.|s^aa
me013|right.|s^aa
me018|i mean i i|s.%--
me018|yeah.|fh
me018|so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say i got it no changes they're off the hook.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|they don't have to go to the web page.|s
me018|and|fh
me013|i mean the other thing i've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth uh is um if you say you've got three months to do this review um people do it you know two and seven eighths months from now.|s
fe016|yeah that's true.|s^aa
me011|right.|b
me013|if you say you've got three weeks to do this review they do do it you know two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review.|s
me013|and um so|fh
me013|if we make it a little less time i don't think it'll be that much|s^cs.%-
me011|well and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth that means we better give them deadline of the first.|fg|s
me011|if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time.|s
me013|there's the responding part.|s^na
me013|and there's also what if|qh.%--
me013|uh i mean i hope this doesn't happen.|s^bd
me013|what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes?|qh
me011|right.|b
me013|then we actually have to deal with that.|s
fe008|uhhuh some lead time.|s^na
me013|if we want it to|%-
me011|ugh!|s^fe
me011|disk space.|s
me011|oh my god!|s^fe
fe008|by the way has has jeremy signed the form?|qy^rt
me011|i hadn't thought about that.|s
fe008|okay.|b
me011|that for every meeting|s.%--
me011|any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of.|s
mn017|oh.|s^bk
me018|just that channel?|qy^bu^d^rt
me001|can't you just do that channel?|qy^rt
me018|oh no we have to do|s^ar|s.%-
me011|no of course not.|s^ar|s^nd
me011|you need all the channels.|s^e
fe016|yeah you have to do all of them.|s^aa|s
me001|oh.|s^bk
me018|do you have to do the other close talking?|qy^rt
fe016|as well as all of these.|s^e
me001|yeah.|s^bk
me051|wow.|s^bk
me011|yes absolutely there's a lot of cross talk.|s^aa|s
fe016|you have to do all you could just do it in that time period though.|s^cs
fe008|well|fg
fe016|but i guess it's a pain.|s^bd
me011|well but you have to copy the whole file.|s^ng
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me011|right?|qy^d^f^g
me011|because we're going to be releasing the whole file.|s^df
fe016|yeah you're right.|s^aa|s^na
fe008|well i you know i think at a certain point that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy.|s
me011|yeah it's just i hate deleting any data.|s^am|s
me011|so i i don't want i really would rather make a copy of it rather than bleep it out.|s
me013|are you are you bleeping it by adding?|qy^rt
me011|and then|%-
me011|overlapping.|s
me011|so it's it's exactly a censor bleep.|fh|s
me011|so what i really think is bleep|s^cs^rt.%--:s^fe.%--
me013|i understand.|s^bk
me011|and then i want to|s^cs.%-
me013|but is is it summing signals?|qy^rt
me013|or do you delete the old one and put the new one in?|qrr
me011|i delete the old one put the new one in.|s
me013|oh okay.|s^bk
me011|there's nothing left of the original signal.|s
me013|because|%-
me013|oh because if you were summing you could|fg|s^cs.%--
me013|no but anyway|s^ar|s^bd.%--
me011|yeah it would be quite easy to get it back again.|s^aa|s^na
fe008|and then i was going to say also that they don't have to stay on the system as you know.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|then someday we can sell the unedited versions.|s^cs^j^t3
fe008|because because the the ones|s^df.%-
me011|say again?|qw^br^co
fe008|once it's been successfully bleeped can't you rely on the|qy.%-
me018|or we'll tell people the frequency of the beep.|s^cs^j^t3
me013|encrypt it.|s^cs^j
me001|you can hide it yeah.|s^cs^j|s^aa
me018|and then they could subtract the beep out.|s^cs^e^j^t3
mn017|oh yeah.|s^aa^j^t3
fe008|can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version?|qy^r
fe016|right exactly i see.|s^aa^j^t3
me001|it wouldn't be that hard to hide it.|s^ba^j^t3
me011|yeah that's true yeah yep that's true.|s^aa
fe016|see this is good.|s^ba
fe016|i wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings.|s^rt
me013|yeah you could encrypt it.|fg|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me001|you can use spread spectrum.|s^cs^j
me013|you know with a with a two hundred bit thousand bit uh|s^cs.%-
me018|uhhuh.|b
fe016|so|fh
me001|hide it.|s^cs^e^j
me018|here we go.|s
fe016|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me001|yeah there you go.|s^j^na
fe016|because we don't have enough asides.|s^ba^df
mn017|i have an idea.|s
mn017|you reverse the signal.|s^cs^j
mn017|so it it lets people say what they said backwards.|s
me001|there you go.|s
me011|backwards.|s
me001|then you have like subliminal uh messages.|s
me011|but|%-
me011|you've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments?|qy
mn017|yeah.|b
me001|like|%-
me011|did you read that paper?|qy^rt
mn017|no.|s^ar
me011|it wouldn't work.|s
me011|the speech recognizer still works.|s
fe016|yeah and if you do it backward then|s^aa|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
me018|that's because they use forward backward.|s
fe016|h good old h m m.|s^ba^j
me011|forward but backward that's right.|s^bk^m|s^aa
fe016|no it's backward forward.|s^ar|s
me011|good point.|s^ba
me011|a point.|s^aap
me011|uh well i'm sorry if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing.|fg|s^fa
me011|it's just we've had meeting after meeting after meeting on this.|s^df
me011|and it seems like we've never gotten it resolved.|s
me013|well but we never also we've also never done it.|s
fe008|huh.|b
fe016|uh|%-
me011|so|fh
me011|yeah.|s^aa
fe008|this is the first cycle.|s
fe016|if it makes|%-
fe008|there're bound to be some glitches the first time through.|s
me013|and uh and i'm sorry responding without uh having much knowledge.|s^fa
me013|but the thing is uh i am like one of these people who gets a gazillion mails.|s^df
me013|and and stuff comes in as|s.%-
me011|well and that's exactly why i did it the way i did it.|s^df
me011|which is the default is if you do nothing we're going to release it.|s
me011|because you know i have my stack of emails of to to be done.|s^rt
me013|yeah.|b
me011|that you know fifty or sixty long.|s^rt
me011|and the ones at the top i'm never going to get to.|s
me013|right.|b
me011|and uh so so|fg
me018|move them to the bottom.|s^cs^j
me011|yeah right.|s^aa^j
me013|so so the only thing we're missing is is some way to respond to easily to say uh okay go ahead or something.|s
me011|so this is going to mean|qy.%-
me018|just re mail them to yourself and then they're at the bottom.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|yeah that's actually definitely a good point.|fg|s^ba
fe008|yeah.|b
me011|the email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email as as opposed to going to the form.|s
mn017|in|%-
fe008|uhhuh.|b^rt
fe016|right.|s^aa
me011|and|%-
fe008|and it also doesn't give a a specific i didn't think of it.|s
fe008|i think it's a good idea an explicit time by which this will be considered definite.|s^cs
me011|yeah release.|fg|s^2
fe008|and and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint.|s^co^e
me013|yeah it's converging.|s^bk|s^ba
mn017|this um i've seen this recently.|s
fe008|yeah that's right.|s^aa
mn017|uh i got email.|s
mn017|and it if i use a mime capable mail reader it actually says you know click on this button to confirm receipt of the of the mail.|s^rt
me001|huh.|b
fe008|oh that's interesting.|s^ba^rt
mn017|so|fh
me011|you you can|%-
me011|a lot of mailers support return receipt.|s^bd
me001|it's like certified mail.|s
fe008|could do that.|s^cs
mn017|right.|s^aa
me011|but it doesn't confirm that they've read it.|s^bd
mn017|no no no this is different.|s^ar|s
mn017|this is not so i i know you can tell you know the uh mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox.|s
fe008|huh.|b
me011|right.|b
mn017|but but no this was different.|s
mn017|in the mail there was a|s.%-
me011|oh just a button.|s^2^bk
mn017|uh there was a button that when you clicked on it it would send uh you know a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail.|s
me011|oh yeah.|b
me011|yeah yeah we could do that.|s^bk|s^am
me011|but i hate that.|s^ba^df
mn017|but it but it only works for you know mime capable.|s
mn017|you know if you use netscape or something like that for your|s.%-
me011|yeah.|b
fe016|you might as well just respond to the mail.|s^cs
me013|and|%-
me013|and we actually need a third thing.|s
mn017|right.|s^aa
fe016|i mean|%-
me013|it's not that you've looked at it.|s
me013|it's that you've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions.|s
mn017|no no you can do that.|s^ar|s^nd
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn017|you know you can put this button anywhere you want.|s
me013|oh?|qy^bh^d
mn017|and you can put it the bottom of the message and say here by you know by clicking on this i i agree uh you know i acknowledge|s.%-:s.%-
me013|oh i see.|s^bk
me013|that my first born children are yours.|s^2^bu^j^rt
me013|and|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|quick question.|s^tc
fe016|are um|qy.%-
me011|well i could put a u r l in there without any difficulty.|s^cs
me011|and even pretty simple mime readers can do that.|s
fe008|but why shouldn't they just email back?|qh
me011|so|fh
me011|yeah reply.|fg|s^bs
me013|yeah.|s^bk
fe008|i don't see there's a problem.|s^ba
mn017|right.|b
fe008|it's very nice.|s^ba
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|i i like the high-tech aspect of it.|s
mn017|no no no i actually don't.|s^ar|s
fe008|but i think|s.%-
fe008|i appreciate it.|s^ba
mn017|i'm just saying that.|s
me011|well i because i use a text mail reader.|s
mn017|if but i'm|s.%-
fe016|don't you use v i?|qy^rt
fe016|for your|s^e.%-
mn017|yeah.|s^aa
me013|wow that's that's my guy.|s^ba
me013|all right.|s^bk
me011|you you read email in v i?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|so i|%-
fe008|i like v i.|s^ba
mn017|there's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page like powered by v i.|s:s
me001|yeah.|b
me013|wow!|s^fe
fe016|anyway quick question.|s^r^tc
me011|you could put wed bugs in the email.|s^cs
me001|i see.|s^bk
fe016|how|qw.%-
mn017|yeah.|s^bk
fe016|like there were three meetings this time or|s.%-
fe016|or how many?|qw
fe008|six.|s
fe016|six.|s^bk^rt
fe016|but of different people.|s
fe016|so i guess if you're in both these types of meetings you'd have a lot.|s^ba
fe016|but how|qw.%--
fe016|i mean it also depends on how many|s.%--
fe016|like if we release this time it's a fairly small number of meetings.|s^ba
fe016|but what if we release like twenty five meetings to people?|qh^cs
me011|well what my expectation is is that we'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready.|s
fe016|in|%-
fe016|i don't know.|s^bd^no
fe016|oh oh okay.|s^bk
me011|so that was my intention.|s
fe016|so this time was just the first chunk okay.|s|s^bk
me011|it's just|s.%--
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|that we just happened to have a bunch all at once.|s^df
fe016|well that's a good idea.|s^ba
me011|i mean maybe|s.%--
me011|is that the way it's going to be you think jane?|qy^rt
fe008|i agree with you.|s
fe008|it's we could do it uh i could i'd be happy with either way.|s
fe008|batch wise|s.%--
fe008|what i was thinking|s.%--
fe008|uh so this one|s.%--
fe008|that was exactly right.|s
fe008|that we had a uh uh|s.%--
fe008|i i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready.|s^rt
fe008|don't have it.|s
fe008|but uh this was the biggest clump i could do by a time where i thought it was reasonable.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fe008|people would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.|s
fe008|my um i was thinking that with the n s a meetings i'd like there are three of them.|s
fe008|and they're uh i i will have them done by monday.|s
fe008|uh unfortunately the time is later.|s^bd
fe008|and i don't know how that's going to work out.|s^bd
fe008|but i thought it'd be good to have that released as a clump too.|s^cs
fe008|because then you know they're they they have a it's in a category.|s^bu
fe008|it's not quite so distracting to them is what i was thinking.|s
fe008|and it's all in one|s.%--
fe008|but after that when we're caught up a bit on this process then um i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available.|s
fe016|okay.|s^bk
fe008|i could do it either way.|s^cs^rt
fe008|i mean it's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking.|s
me013|we heard anything from i b m?|qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc
me013|at all.|s^e^rt
me018|uh let's see.|h|s
me018|we|%--
me018|yeah right.|s^bk
me018|so we got the transcript back from that one meeting.|s
me018|everything seemed fine.|s^ba^rt
me018|adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was well there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix.|s
me018|and then um we uh i sent him a pointer to three more.|s
me018|and so he's off and working on those.|s
me011|yeah now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting to see whether the transcript is correct.|fg|s
me011|and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff.|s
fe008|that's on my list.|s^na
me011|so at some point we need to do that.|s^cs
me018|yeah.|b
fe008|well that's on my list.|s^r
me018|yeah it's going to have to go through our regular process.|fg|s
me011|i mean the one thing i noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels.|s
me011|there are a fair number of yeahs and uhhuh that it's just that aren't in there.|s
me011|so|fh
fe008|huh.|b
me013|but i think yeah like you said i mean that's that's going to be our standard|s.%--
me013|that's what the transcribers are going to be spending most of their time doing i would imagine.|s
fe008|uhhuh.|b
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|b
me013|once once we|%-
me011|yes absolutely yeah.|s^bk
fe008|one question about the backchannels.|s
me013|it's going to|s.%--
fe008|do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre segmenter?|qy^rt
me011|yes absolutely absolutely.|s^aa
fe008|oh interesting.|s^ba
fe008|oh interesting okay.|s^ba^r
me011|yeah they're they're not in the segmented.|fg|s
me011|it's not that the i b m people didn't do it.|s
fe008|okay.|s^bk
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me011|just they didn't get marked.|s
fe008|okay so maybe when the detector for that gets better or something|s^bk|s.%--
fe008|i i|%--
fe008|there's another issue which is this|s.%--
fe008|we've been uh contacted by university of washington now of course to um|s.%--
fe008|we sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings.|s^rt
fe008|and they're downloading the audio files.|s
fe008|so they'll be doing that.|s
fe008|chuck's chuck's uh put that in.|s
me018|uhhuh yeah i pointed them to the set that andreas put uh on the web.|s^aa|s
me018|so if they want to compare directly with his results they can.|s
me018|and um then once uh|s.%--
me018|we can also point them at the um uh the original meetings.|s
me018|and they can grab those too with s c p.|s
fe016|wait so you put the reference files|qy^bu^d^rt.%--
me018|no no they they wanted the audio.|s^ar|s
fe016|or the|qrr.%-
me018|jane sent them the uh transcripts.|s
fe016|no i mean of the transcripts.|s^ar|s
fe016|um|fh
fe016|well we can talk about it off line.|s^cs
me011|there's another meeting in here what at four?|qy^rt
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
me011|right?|qy^d^g
me011|yeah so we have to finish by three forty five.|s^co
mn017|so does does does u w want to do this want to use this data for recognition or for something else?|qr
me018|uh for recognition.|s
mn017|oh.|s^bk
fe016|i think they're doing|s.%--
fe016|didn't they want to do language modeling on you know recognition compatible transcripts?|qy^bu^rt
mn017|oh i see.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|or|qrr.%--
fe008|this is to show you uh some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure.|s
fe008|so this is from one of the n s a meetings.|s
fe008|and uh if you're familiar with the diff format the arrow to the left is what it was.|s
fe008|and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to.|s
fe008|so|fh
fe008|and now the first one.|s
fe008|okay so then we started a weekly meeting.|s
fe008|the last time uh and the transcriber thought little too much.|s^ba:s
fe008|but uh|fh
fe008|really um it was we learned too much.|s:s
fe008|which makes more sense syntactically as well.|s^ba
mn017|and these the parentheses were from|s^bu.%-
fe008|then|%-
fe008|oh this that's the convention for indicating uncertain.|s^bk|s
me011|uncertains.|s
fe008|so the transcriber was right.|s
fe008|you know she was uncertain about that.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
fe008|so she's right to be uncertain.|s
mn017|oh okay.|b
fe008|and it's also a a good indication of the of that.|s
fe008|the next one this was about uh claudia.|s
fe008|and she'd been really busy with stuff such as waivers.|s
fe008|uh okay.|s^bk
fe008|um next one.|s
fe008|um this was an interesting one.|s
fe008|so the original was so that's not so claudia's not the bad master here.|s:s
fe008|and then he laughs.|s
me011|web master.|s
fe008|but it really web master.|s
me001|oh uhoh.|s^bk
fe008|and then you see another type of uncertainty which is you know they just didn't know what to make out of that.|s
fe008|so instead of split upon unknown it's split in principle.|s
me011|yep.|b
me001|jane these are from i b m?|qy^bu^d^rt
me011|spit upon?|qy^bu^d^t3
me001|the top lines.|s^e^rt
fe008|no no these are these are our local transcriptions of the n s a meetings.|s^ar|s
me011|no these are ours.|s^ar|s
me001|oh.|s^bk
fe008|the transcribers transcriber's version versus the checked version.|s^e
me001|oh i see.|s^bk
fe008|my my checked version after i go through it.|s^e
me001|okay.|s^bk
fe008|um then you get down here.|s
fe008|um|fh
fe008|sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms.|s
fe008|that's the next example.|s
fe008|the next one.|s
fe008|the uh version beyond this is|s.%--
fe008|so instead of saying or|s.%--:s.%--
fe008|especially those words also and oder and some other ones.|s
fe008|those sneak in.|s
fe008|um the next one|s.%-
mn017|discourse markers.|s
me011|that's cool.|s^ba
mn017|discourse markers.|s^r
fe008|sorry what?|s^fa|qw^rt
fe008|discourse markers?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
mn017|discourse markers.|s^r
fe008|sure sure sure sure.|s^aa
mn017|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe008|and it's and it makes sense.|s^ba
fe008|because it's like below this it's a little subliminal there.|s^df
mn017|yeah.|b
mn017|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fe008|um okay the next one.|fg|s
fe008|uh this is a term.|s^rt
fe008|the problem with terminology.|s
fe008|description with the transcriber has x as an advance.|s:s
fe008|but really it's q s in advance.|s:s
fe008|i mean i i've benefited from some of these uh cross group meetings.|s
fe008|okay then you got|fg|s.%--
fe008|um uh|fh
fe008|instead of from something or other cards it's for multicast.|s:s
fe008|and instead of ann system related it's end system related.|s:s
fe008|this was changed to an acronym initially.|s
fe008|and it shouldn't have been.|s
fe008|and then you can see here g p s was misinterpreted.|s
fe008|it's just totally|s^by.%--
fe008|this is this is a lot of jargon.|s
fe008|um and the final one|s.%--
fe008|the transcriber had in the core network itself|s.%--
fe008|or the exit unknown.|s
fe008|not the internet unknown.|s
fe008|and it it comes through as in the core network itself of the access provider.|s
fe008|not the internet backbone core.|s
fe008|now this is a lot of terminology.|s^ba
mn017|huh.|s^aa
fe008|and they're generally extremely good|s^ba.%--
fe008|but you know in this this area it really does pay to um to double check.|s
fe008|and i'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you'll see substantial improvements in performance.|s
fe008|because the you know there're a lot of these in there.|s
mn017|yeah so how often|fg|qw.%-
me011|yeah but i bet i bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway though.|fg|s
me001|huh.|b
fe008|no actually no.|s^ar
me011|oh really?|qy^bh
fe008|huh uh.|s^aa
me011|uh it's|%--
me011|oh so it's just jargon.|s^bk|s
fe008|it's jargon yeah.|s^bk^m|s^aa
fe008|i mean this is because you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top down influences in what you're hearing.|s^df
mn017|well but|%-
mn017|but but|%-
fe008|and it's it's jargon coupled with a foreign accent.|s
mn017|but we don't i mean our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow.|s
mn017|so|fh
mn017|you know until you actually get a decent language model adam's right.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|it probably won't do any better.|s^2
mn017|you probably won't notice a difference.|s
mn017|but it's i mean it's definitely good that these are fixed.|s^ba
mn017|i mean obviously.|s^bd
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|well also from the standpoint of getting people's approval.|s
fe008|because if someone sees a page full of uh um barely decipherable you know sentences and then is asked to approve of it or not it's uh uh|s.%--
me011|did i say that?|qy^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah that would be a shame if people said well i don't approve it because the it's not what i said.|fg|s
fe008|okay.|b.x
me011|well that's exactly why i put the extra option in|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|exactly that's why we discussed that.|s^aa|s
me011|is that i was afraid people would say let's censor that because it's wrong.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me011|and i don't want them to do that.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|and then i also the final thing i have for transcription is that i made a purchase of some other headphones.|s
fe008|because of the problem of low gain in the originals.|s^df
fe008|and and they very much they much prefer the new ones.|s
fe008|and actually i i mean i i think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice.|s
fe008|we'd originally chosen uh very expensive headsets.|s
me011|yeah.|b
me011|ugh!|s^fe
fe008|but um they're just not as good as these um in this with this respect to this particular task.|s^ba
mn017|well return the old ones.|s
me011|it's probably impedance matching problems.|s
me011|but|fh
fe008|i don't know exactly.|s
fe008|but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription.|s^df
me013|could be.|s^am
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe008|so it we had every reason to think they would work.|s
mn017|so you have spare headsets?|qy^bu^d^rt
fe008|sorry what?|s^fa|qw^br
mn017|you have spare headsets?|qy^bu^d^r^rt
me011|they're just earphones.|s^ng
me011|they're not headsets.|s^e^ng
me011|they're not microphones.|s^e^ng
mn017|no no i mean just earphones.|s^ar|s^rt
fe016|right.|b
mn017|um|fh
mn017|because i uh i could use one on my workstation.|s^df
mn017|just to|%--
mn017|because sometimes i have to listen to audio files.|s^df
mn017|and i don't have to go borrow it from someone.|s
mn017|and|fh
fe008|we have actually i have|s.%--
fe008|well the thing is that if we have four people come to work for a day i was i was hanging on to the others for uh for spares.|s
mn017|oh okay.|s^bk
mn017|sure no problem.|s^bk|s^bd
me013|no but you'd if you yeah we should get it.|s^cs
fe008|but i can tell you what i recommend.|s^cs
me011|but if you need it just get it.|s
mn017|i just|%-
me011|come on.|s
mn017|right.|s^bk
me013|yeah if you need it.|s^e
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me001|yeah i still i still need to get a pair too.|fg|s
fe008|it'd just have to be a a separate order an added order.|s
me013|they're they're they're they're pretty inexpensive.|s^ba
fe016|yeah that|%-
fe016|we should order a uh two or three or four actually.|s^cs
me001|i'm using one of these.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me001|yeah.|b
mn017|i think i have a pair that i brought from home.|s
fe016|we have|%-
mn017|but it's just for music listening.|s
me013|no just just just just buy them.|s^co
mn017|and it's not|s.%--
fe016|just get the model number.|s^cs
mn017|nnn yeah.|b
fe016|and|%--
me013|just buy them.|s^co^r
fe016|where do you buy these from?|qw^rt
mn017|yeah.|b
fe008|cambridge soundworks just down the street.|s
fe016|like|%--
fe016|you just go and|s.%--
fe016|oh.|s^bk
fe008|yeah they always have them in stock.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn017|anyway.|s^tc
fe016|that'd be a good idea.|s^ba
me011|uh could you email out the brand?|qy^rt
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|oh sure yeah okay.|s^aa
me011|because i think sounds like people are interested.|s^df
me001|yeah.|s^aa
me011|so|fh
me001|definitely.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
fe008|it's made a difference in in how easy|s^ba.%--
fe008|yeah.|b
me013|i realized something i should talk about.|s^t^tc
me013|so what's the other thing on the agenda actually?|qw^t
me011|uh the only one was don wanted to uh talk about disk space yet again.|s
me001|yeah.|s^aa
me001|it's short.|s^ba
me001|i mean if you want to go we can just throw it in at the end.|s
me013|no no why don't you why don't you go ahead?|s^ar|qh^co
me013|since it's short.|s^df
me001|um well uh|h
me011|oh i thought you meant the disk space.|s
mn017|the disk space was short.|s
me011|yeah we know disk space is short.|s^aa|s
mn017|yeah that's what i thought too.|s^aa|s^na
fe016|that's a great ambiguity.|s^ba
me013|yeah.|s^aa
fe016|it's one of these|s.%--
fe016|it's it's social.|s
me013|it's|%-
fe016|and uh discourse level.|s^e
me001|yeah.|b
fe016|and|fh
me013|yeah it's great.|fg|s^ba
fe016|sorry.|s^fa
me013|yeah.|b
me013|double double|%-
me011|yeah it was really|fg|s.%-
fe016|see if i had that little scratch pad i would have made an x there.|s:s
me001|thank you thank you.|s^ft
me011|uh well we'll give you one then.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me001|um so um|fg
me001|without thinking about it when i offered up my hard drive last week|s.%--
me011|oh no!|s^by^fe
fe016|it was while i was out of town.|s
me001|um this is always a suspect phrase.|s
me001|but um no i uh i realized that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments um for this uh paper we're writing.|fg|s
me001|so we're probably going to need a lot more.|s
me001|we're probably going to need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive.|s
me001|but um we also have someone else coming in that's going to help us out with some stuff.|s^df
me001|so|fh
me013|we've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.|s^df
fe016|i think we need like another eighteen gig disk to be safe.|s^cs^rt
me001|okay we just need to|s^bk|s^cs.%-
me013|well we're getting three thirty thirty sixes.|s
fe016|so|%-
me001|okay.|s^bk
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|that are going into the main file server.|s^e
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me018|markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon.|s
me001|well so so|fg
me013|so|fh
me011|soon?|qo^m^rt
me001|yeah i mean i guess the thing is is all i need is to hang it off like the person who's coming in sonali's computer.|fg|s
mn017|oh so so you mean the the internal the disks on the machines that we just got?|s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
me001|whew!|s^fe
me001|or we can move them.|s^cs
me011|no.|s^ar
mn017|or extra disk?|qrr
me018|these are going to go onto abbott.|s
me011|new disks.|s
me013|onto abbott.|s
me001|so are we going to move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in?|qy^rt
me013|the file server.|s
mn017|oh oh okay.|s^bk
me011|on|%-
me011|yeah.|s^aa
me011|once they come in sure.|s
fe016|uh|%-
me001|okay that's fine.|s^bk|s^ba
fe016|do when when is this planned for roughly?|qw
me018|they should be i i imagine next week or something.|s^rt
fe016|okay.|s^bk
me001|okay.|s^bk
me011|if you're if you're desperate i have some space on my drive.|s^cs^rt
fe016|so|fg
me001|i think if i'm|s.%-
me011|but i i vacillate between no space free and a few gig free.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me001|yeah i think i can find something if i'm desperate.|fg|s
me011|so|fh
me001|and um in the meantime i'll just hold out.|s
me011|okay.|s^bk
me001|that was the only thing i wanted to bring up.|s
me018|it should be soon.|s
me018|we we should|s.%-
me001|okay.|s^bk
me013|so there's another hundred gig.|s
me013|so|fh
me001|all right great.|s^ba
mn017|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me001|that's it.|s^tc
me013|it's great to be able to do it.|s^ba
fe016|good.|b
me013|just say oh yeah a hundred gig.|s:s
me001|yeah.|b
me011|yeah.|b
me013|no big deal.|s:s^ba
me011|a hundred gig here.|s:s
me011|a hundred gig there.|s:s
fe016|well each meeting is like a gig or something.|s
me011|it's eventually real disk space.|s
me013|yeah.|b
fe016|so it's really|s.%-
me013|yeah.|b
me013|um yeah i was just going to comment that i'm going to uh be on the phone with mari tomorrow late afternoon.|fg|s
me011|oh yeah.|b
me013|we're supposed to get together and talk about uh where we are on things.|s
me013|uh there's this meeting coming up.|s^rt
me013|uh and there's also an annual report now.|s
me013|i never actually|s.%--
me013|i i was asking about this.|s
me013|i don't really quite understand this.|s
me013|she was she was referring to it as|s.%--
me013|i think this actually didn't just come from her.|s
me013|but this is what uh darpa had asked for.|s
me013|um she's referring to it as the annual report for the fiscal year.|s
me013|but of course the fiscal year starts in october.|s
me013|so i don't quite understand why we do an annual report that we're writing in july.|s
me018|she's either really late or really early.|s^ba
me011|huh.|b
me011|or she's getting a good early start.|s^2
me013|uh i think basically it's none of those.|s
me013|it's that the meeting is in july.|s
me013|so they so darpa just said do an annual report.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|so anyway i'll be putting together stuff.|fh|s
me013|i'll do it uh you know as much as i can without bothering people.|s
me013|just by looking at at papers and status reports.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me013|i mean the status reports you do are very helpful.|s^ba
me013|uh so i can grab stuff there.|s
me013|and if uh if i have some questions i'll|s.%--
me011|when we remember to fill them out.|s^2
me013|yeah if people could do it as soon as as you can if you haven't done one recently.|s^aa|s^cs
me013|uh uh|fh
me013|but you know i'm i'm sure before it's all done i'll end up bugging people for for more clarification about stuff.|s
me013|um but um|fh
me013|i don't know.|s^bd^no
me013|i guess i guess i know pretty much what people have been doing.|s^rt
me013|we have these meetings and and there's the status reports.|s
me013|uh but um um|fh
me013|yeah so that wasn't a long one just to tell you that and if something hasn't uh|fg|s.%--
me013|i'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon.|s
me013|and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it's important thing to mention on this kind of thing uh uh just pop me a one liner.|s
me013|and and and i'll i'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
me013|uh.|fh
me013|i guess uh you're still pecking away at the demos and all that probably.|s^t
me011|yep.|s^aa
me011|and don is going to be helping out with that.|s
me013|oh that's right.|s^bk
me011|so|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
me011|did you want to talk about that this afternoon?|qy^rt
me001|um|fh
me011|not here but later today.|s^e^rt
me001|we should probably talk off line about when we're going to talk off line.|s^cs
me011|okay okay.|s^bk
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah i might want to get updated about it in about a week.|fg|s
me013|because um i'm actually going to have a a few days off the following week.|s^df
me013|after the after the picnic.|s^e
me013|so|fh
me011|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|that's all i had.|s^t^tc
me011|so we were going to do sort of status of speech transcription.|s
me011|automatic transcription.|s^bsc
me011|but we're kind of running late.|s
me011|so|fh
fe016|how long does it take you to save the data?|qw
me011|fifteen minutes.|s
fe016|yeah.|s^bk
me011|so|fh
me011|if you want to do a quick|s.%-
fe016|yeah.|s^aa
me011|ten minute.|s
fe016|guess we should stop like twenty of at the latest.|s^cs
me013|uh|%-
fe016|we we have another meeting coming in that they want to record.|s
fe016|so|fh
me013|and there's the digits to do.|s^2
me013|so maybe maybe maybe|s.%-
me011|yeah well we can skip the digits.|s^bk|s^cs
me013|we could.|s^am
me013|five minute report or something.|s^cs
fe016|it's up to you.|s^rt
fe016|i don't|s.%-
me011|whatever you want.|s
me013|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me013|well i would love to hear about it.|s^na
me011|what do you have to say?|qw
me011|i'm interested.|s^na
me013|especially since|s^df.%-
me011|so|fh
me013|yeah well i'm going to be on the phone tomorrow.|fg|s
me013|so this is just a good example of the sort of thing i'd like to hear about.|s^ba
fe016|wait why is everybody looking at me?|qw^rt
me011|sorry.|s^fa
me018|i don't know.|s^no
me013|because he looked at you.|s
mn017|what?|qw
me013|and says you're sketching.|s
fe016|uh i'm not sure what you were referring to.|h|s^no
mn017|i i i i'm not actually i'm not sure what|s^no.%-
mn017|are we supposed to have done something?|qy^rt
me011|no we were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting.|s^ar|s
mn017|oh.|s^bk
mn017|alternating.|s^bk^m
fe016|uhhuh.|s^bk
me011|and this week we were going to try to do automatic transcription status.|s
fe016|i wasn't here last week.|s^df
mn017|oh!|s^bk^fe
fe016|sorry.|s^fa
fe016|oh.|s^bk
mn017|we did that last week.|s^bu
me011|but we sort of failed.|s
mn017|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fe016|hhh.|b
me011|no.|s^ar
me013|i thought we did.|s^am
me011|did we?|qh^rt
mn017|yeah we did.|s^aa|s^na
me011|okay.|s^bk
me011|okay so now now we have the schedule.|s^bk|s
me011|so next week we'll do automatic transcription status.|s^cc^t
me011|plus anything that's real timely.|s
mn017|okay.|s^bk
fe016|oh .okay.|s^bk
fe008|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay whew!|s^bk|s^ba^fe
me011|whew!|s^ba^fe
me018|good update.|s^ba
me013|that was|%-
me011|dodged that bullet.|s^j
me013|yeah nicely done liz.|s^ba
fe008|a woman of few words.|s
me013|but but lots of prosody.|s^2
me013|okay okay.|s^bk
mn017|uh i mean we we really haven't done anything.|s
me011|excuse me?|qw^br^rt
mn017|sorry.|s^fa
fe008|well since last week.|s^2
fe016|yeah we're|fg|%-
mn017|i mean the the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the um the automatic alignments.|s
mn017|because uh i got some|s.%--
mn017|i i i learned from thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech.|s
mn017|or of the foreground speech with background speech.|s^bsc
mn017|so|fh
me011|yeah.|b
mn017|but we haven't actually|s.%-
fe016|and then uh i guess the new data that don will start to process|s^rt.%--
fe016|the um|%--
fe016|when he can get these|s.%--
fe016|you know before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous.|s
fe016|and that caused a lot of problems.|s
mn017|huh.|b
me011|oh right right.|b
fe016|because you have timed at on either side.|s^df
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|and so that's sort of a|s.%--
fe016|stage two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step.|s^cs
me011|right.|b
fe016|we did get our um|s.%--
fe008|i'll be interested.|s^ba
fe016|i guess good news.|s^ba
fe016|we got our abstract accepted for this conference.|s
fe016|um workshop.|fh|s^bsc
fe016|isca workshop in um uh new jersey.|s^e
fe016|and we sent in a very poor abstract.|s^ba
fe016|but they|s.%-
fe016|very poor.|s^ba
fe016|very quick.|s^ba
fe016|um|fh
fe016|but we're hoping to have a paper for that as well.|s
fe016|which should be an interesting|s^ba.%-
me011|when's it due?|qw
fe016|the paper isn't due until august.|s
fe016|the abstracts were already due.|s
fe016|so it's that kind of workshop.|s
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|but i mean the good news is that that will have sort of the european experts in prosody.|s
fe016|sort of a different crowd.|s
fe016|and i think we're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far.|s^df
fe016|so that should be interesting.|s^ba
fe008|what's the name of the meeting?|qw
fe016|uh it's isca workshop on prosody in speech recognition and understanding or something like that.|h|s
mn017|it's called prosody to|s.%-
me011|uhhuh.|b
fe016|some generic|s.%--
fe008|good.|b
fe016|uh so it's focused on using prosody in automatic systems.|s
fe016|and there's a um a web page for it.|s
me013|you going to uh eurospeech?|qy^d^rt
mn017|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me011|i don't have a paper.|s^ng
me011|but i'd kind of like to go.|s^df
me011|if i could.|s^e
me011|is that all right?|qy^rt
me013|we'll discuss it.|s^am
me011|okay i guess that's no.|s^bk|s
me013|my my my car my car needs a good wash by the way.|s^cs^j
me011|okay well that hey if that's what it takes that's fine with me.|s^bk|s^j^na
me013|um|fh
me011|i'll pick up your dry cleaning too.|s^j
me011|should we do digits?|qw^rt^t
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me011|uh|h
mn017|can i go next?|z
mn017|because i have to leave actually.|z
me011|yep.|z
me011|go for it.|z
me011|huh.|z
me011|thanks.|z
me011|thank you.|z
me013|so you get to be the one who has all the paper rustling.|z
me013|right?|z
me011|okay.|z
me011|so we should be on.|z
mn082|so|z
me011|and i'm going to go ahead and start by reading the digit strings.|z
me011|just to give you an example of how to do it.|z
me011|and so the first thing to do is read the transcript number.|z
me011|which is on the right hand side there.|z
me011|and so if you could just go around the table.|z
me011|and read them out.|z
fn083|okay.|z
fn083|should i next?|z
me011|yep.|z
me011|if you could sign that?|z
me011|thanks.|z
me011|thanks.|z
me011|so i wanted to just reiterate because we did have have one person come in a little later that um there will be an opportunity to remove anything from the transcript that you don't want made public after it's transcribed.|z
me011|so that'll be some months off.|z
me011|but you will have that opportunity.|z
me011|okay?|z
me011|thanks.|z
mn021|okay.|z
mn082|okay.|z
mn082|thanks adam.|z
mn082|we could start with our meeting?|z
me011|yep!|z
mn082|yep!|z
me011|thanks very much.|z
mn082|okay.|z
mn082|you have to stay all the time here?|z
me011|i don't have to.|z
me011|um|z
mn082|but you want to do?|z
me011|well.|z
me011|it's just at the end of the meeting don't turn off the mikes.|z
me011|just leave them on.|z
mn021|okay.|z
me011|and uh|z
me011|uh|z
me011|actually could actually could you call me at the end of the meeting?|z
me011|i'll leave my number on the board there.|z
mn082|yeah.|z
mn082|okay.|z
me011|thanks.|z
mn082|we can do that.|z
fn083|hey adam you know what?|z
fn083|it must be funny to do an research on how people behave while reading these numbers.|z
me011|numbers are strange!|z
fn083|that must be|z
me011|it is!|z
fn083|yeah!|z
fn083|it must be much more interesting to to see their behavior.|z
me011|the the meetings are strange.|z
fn083|oh yeah!|z
me011|people interrupt each other much more than i thought they did.|z
mn082|two nine seven seven?|z
mn082|right.|z
me011|two nine seven seven.|z
mn082|okay.|z
mn021|okay.|z
mn082|yeah.|z
mn082|i will call you then.|z
me011|thanks.|z
mn082|uh okay.|fg
mn082|so then let's start with our weekly meeting.|s^co^rt^t
mn082|the last time's uh we learned too much i believe.|s
mn082|so|fh
mn082|uh today i have two topics.|fh|s^t
mn082|and the first topic um we have a new member in our group.|s^t
mn082|miguel sanchez.|s^e
mn082|i believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time.|s
mn021|hi.|s
mn082|and i think he is talking to everybody in the meantime.|s
mn082|so but anyway i would like that miguel sanchez will introduce himself a little bit concerning his background what he intend to do.|s^co
mn082|and because i discussing with him uh uh many things concerning uh his skills and what the n. s. a group intends to do.|fh|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|i hope there will be a match uh then for his future work.|s
mn082|and the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail.|s^t
mn082|i believe we still haven't left our starting position.|s
mn082|and um yesterday i also discussed with wilbert some things.|fh|s
mn082|and i would like to focus on the question what problem we are going to solve with such a proposal.|s^co^t
mn082|not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside.|s
mn082|but the technical problem.|s
mn082|but that's under the second topic.|s^df
mn082|so first i would like that miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and and uh his background.|s^co
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|thank you joe.|s^ft
mn082|so please.|s
mn021|well i uh as all of you know i came from from spain.|s
mn021|from the uh polytechnic university of valencia.|s^e
mn021|and uh i um just finished my p. h. d thesis about uh power saving techniques for wireless networking.|fh|s
mn021|uh in fact i have developed an algorithm to control the radio frequency power uh of a wireless transceiver.|fh|s
mn021|and uh i've been working also in routing issues especially in the so-called ad hoc wireless networks.|fh|s
mn021|where uh you have a set of uh mobile nodes and no other infrastructure.|s^e
mn021|no base stations.|s^e
mn021|so all the routing functions are done by the node by the same nodes.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so nodes act as both end points and routers.|s
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|i've in the study for some time these kind of networks.|s
mn021|and uh in fact there are a lot of of research uh articles about this this kind of networks because you know uh huh infrastructure based network network has been a long topic of research.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|for example routing on on wired networks is a a topic still to be researched.|s^e
mn021|but it has an important background.|s
mn021|but mobile this kind of mobile networks is a little bit uh newer.|s
mn021|especially because uh until not so long uh the the things were too heavy to have a computer a wireless transceiver on a more or less portable thing.|s^df
mn021|so with the advent of this new technology low power uh high uh processing capability and wireless uh networking capability in a really small package new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing in the market.|fh|s
mn021|and uh well this is more or less what i have done.|fh|s
mn021|and the kind of uh things i'm interested is more or less all around this these kind of networks.|s
mn021|but i could say uh in general mobile service is not only about uh these specific kind of networks.|s
mn021|but in general about uh services uh over mobile or services that can benefit from the uh capability of nodes to move around.|s
mn021|and uh well i i've been teaching now for twelve years uh at a computer sciences school in my university.|fh|s
mn021|i've been teaching computer networks.|s^e
mn021|and well i am more or less uh knowledgeable about well t. c. p i. p networking i. s. o uh networking.|s
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|well i'm i'm a computer guy.|s
mn021|so i'm really um well i can say uh proudly uh more or less computer skilled.|s
mn021|i mean uh operating systems uh programming languages uh networking.|s^e
mn021|so this kind of things i think i'm more or less well-trained.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|this is i think um my first presentation.|s
mn021|next maybe next meeting i will uh do a small sketch about uh my past work and well presenting some a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and and some things from previous talks so you can have a better idea of the kind of work i've been doing.|s^cc
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|thank you.|s^ft
mn082|so thanks miguel.|s^ft
mn082|yeah we discussed it yesterday that you'll maybe will have a talk next tuesday.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|but give me a sign and send me an abstract so that i can announce it then for the next meeting.|s^co
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|that's okay.|s^bk
mn082|um|fh
mn082|one short other topic is uh claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime.|s^tc
fn083|oh.|s^bk
fn083|okay.|s^bk
mn082|and despite busy stuff with waivers and uh and visas and whatever uh she found the time to um write with what we discussed before and in the form of h. t. m. l stuff.|fh|s
mn082|and we want to put it on the web pages in the next days.|s
mn082|so i will send an email then to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they're aligned with um their own views and opinions of what we should what should be presented on the web pages.|fh|s^cc
mn082|and any feedback is then well appreciated.|s
mn082|no?|%
mn021|okay.|b
mn082|so|fg
mn082|let's switch to the project proposal.|s^co^t^tc
mn082|um i mentioned that it is still|fh|s.%-
fn083|uh.|fg
fn083|sorry.|s^fa
fn083|can i|qy.%-
mn082|yeah?|qw^d
fn083|maybe i can add something.|s
mn082|claudia|%
fn083|yeah if there's anything else which we what we could add on the web site.|s
fn083|so for example if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever about the work you did before what you are planning to do here that would be fine.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
fn083|because now we can add some more stuff there.|s^df
fn083|or if you have something or if somebody has some slides or articles whatever he wants to be published there.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|then everybody sees the structure how it is uh structured really structured.|s
fn083|yeah.|s^bk
fn083|and|fh
mn082|then maybe you can easy offer some additional input which should be presented then on the web pages.|s
fn083|yeah it depends what what everybody wants to do.|s^bk|s^ng
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
fn083|so|fg
fn083|about the projects will be something.|s
fn083|then about publications will be another point.|s
fn083|and yeah additional information about how is life in berkeley and yep i don't know some some hints some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that.|s
mn082|yeah it is.|s^na
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|half collection of necessary information.|s
mn030|but there's no personal homepage for everybody?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn030|or is it planned or not?|fh|qr
mn082|yeah you can have|%-
mn030|or|fh
mn082|yeah you can have it.|s^aa|s
mn082|because as uh uh uh|s^df.%-
mn030|i'm not interested in this.|s^nd
mn030|that makes work.|s^df
mn082|no.|s^ar
mn082|but this is oh uh everybody's obliged to do it for his own you know.|s^df
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|so there is not uh claudia is not the webmaster here to uh get the collection for for for everything.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
fn083|oh oh no i'm not doing it for everybody.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|so|fg
fn083|but what i can|s.%-
mn082|this is responsible for uh everybody's responsible for his own.|s
mn082|yeah.|fh
fn083|yeah but but what is planned is that i do something like previous you know layout and give everybody the uh uh the possibility to the chance to put his content inside.|s^bk|s
mn030|sure.|b
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|his name and so on.|s
fn083|so that the layout is for everybody the same.|s^df
mn030|yeah.|b
mn021|well like have a blueprint.|s
fn083|so about the projects and stuff.|s^df
mn030|okay.|b
mn030|uhhuh.|b
fn083|so there will be something.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|thanks.|s^ft
mn082|so|fg
mn082|let's switch to the proposal.|s^co^rt^t^tc
mn082|i ask everybody whether read it in the meantime and understand everything.|s
mn082|yeah.|%
mn082|everybody say yes?|qy^d^rt
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^rt
mn030|yes.|s^aa
mn082|yes.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|um|fh
mn082|from my point of view as i mentioned before we still in the starting position.|s
mn082|i think the four building blocks on the network level will have really a major impact on on current um available wireless networks and uh also for future generations.|s
mn082|and what the missing thing is really what kind of problem we are want to solve with such a project proposal.|fh|s
mn082|and wilbert yesterday mentioned and he is right that what kind of maybe service we are really going to offer.|s
mn082|the linkage between such kind of application also interactive multimedia application and uh this kind of networking stuff is um maybe not very well aligned.|s
mn082|because there will be of course a portion of mobile access to such kind of application.|s^df
mn082|but i think that's not the majority.|s
mn082|and that is not the major focus of um this kind of um this kind of application anyway.|s
mn082|so i would like to to uh split in principle the discussions of what kind of application tsk um far away.|s
mn082|and i would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision concerning these building blocks and the network um what kind of problem we are going to solve.|s
mn082|what kind of uh um um glue between these four building blocks exists.|s
mn082|and what kind of synergy effects in principle as if they work and fit very well together exists for networking stuff.|fh|s
mn082|and what kind of service could we provide in that area.|s
mn082|we will have these kind of uh really closely working together of these four building blocks.|s
mn082|so maybe uh wilbert you can start to oder to to tell the group about what you mentioned yesterday concerning certain kind of ideas.|s^co
mn082|maybe it's a brainstorming um of of these things.|s^am
mn082|and maybe we can comment later on these uh these ideas.|s^cs
mn082|and i saw you still discuss with with uh mark right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn082|some stuff.|s^e
mn082|was it also related with with these things?|qy
mn081|no.|s^ar
mn082|no.|s^bk^m
mn082|okay it was.|s
mn081|this afternoon you mean?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn081|no this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks.|s^ar|s^nd
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah yeah.|b
mn082|then maybe then one one uh sentence before.|s^cs
mn082|i believe everybody fits very well in these kind of things.|s
mn082|because from the mathematical description with q. s. in advance me as an expert for quality of service and uh michael as an expert for uh m. p. l. s and wilbert an expert for for multicast and uh i discussed with miguel it's uh maybe a little bit the shift to active routing.|s^df
mn082|but it is still in the area of routing.|s
mn082|so my idea is in principle to have independently of any funding independently of any outer contact such such a core activity in principle.|s^cs
mn082|and we can see how much from the outer world can fit in.|s^cs
mn082|first of all the first stage is the institution which is behind everybody.|s
mn082|that means uh k. p. n in your case and siemens in our case.|s^e
mn082|and maybe then in the broader world here other partners registered in the proposal|s.%--
mn082|tomorrow i will go to cisco for instance.|s^e
mn082|and i will discuss uh all this kind of things.|s^cc
mn082|maybe they have certain additional activities and they're interested in the results before.|s^am
mn082|the benefit here is in principle that the results are available.|s
mn082|they are not restricted any way.|s^df
mn082|if you have your own common activity that makes a little bit more easier.|s
mn082|and uh if there is a technical linkage between such uh um between the outer world and us okay the better it is.|fh|s
mn082|but anyway if we come to a certain kind of uh common work within the core of the n. s. a group i think that's really beneficial to everybody.|s
mn082|and uh especially wilbert if you have in mind to go in the huh uh really from the project proposal view i think we can build it on this this core.|fh|s
mn082|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|and go to the outer world with and and and align it in a certain way.|s
mn082|for instance that it also fit maybe to k. p. n and siemens and in other companies.|s^cs
mn082|yeah.|fh
mn081|yeah and this probably has to be a brainstorm right now.|s
mn082|yep.|s^aa
mn081|um what i told joachim yesterday was that uh uh for my company the company i work for they are more interested in in an explicit service than in core technology.|fg|s
mn081|me on the other hand i'm more interested in uh core service or core technology myself.|s
mn081|so i'm i was thinking about uh how i could combine the both of them.|s
mn081|k. p. n was um they're interested in having uh like six people or something working on the project for one year.|s
mn081|or maybe uh three people working on the project for two years.|s
mn081|and have a kind of a demonstration uh for a specifically u. m. t. s service.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn081|i was thinking that um as a well not really a u. m. t. s service but yesterday what i discussed with joachim was uh a little bit based on your ad hoc networking also.|s^cs
mn081|that it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from a wavelan technology to um u. m. t. s.|s
mn081|i think that's uh it's in in the future that will be a main competitor of uh of u. m. t. s.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn081|too like the the the lucent uh equipment has a huge scope already.|s^e
mn081|like five hundred feet or or even more sometimes.|s^e
mn081|so that's it's might be interesting for a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network.|s
mn081|you can switch from u. m. t. s or uh uh to wavelan technologies.|s
mn082|huh.|b
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|uh maybe i will write a few keywords on the on the whiteboard.|s
mn081|sure.|s^aa
mn082|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn081|of course it sounds strange for a company that does u. m. t. s to switch to to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to wavelan.|s
mn081|but at the end it makes it easier for your and cheaper for your customers.|s^df
mn081|so if they don't do it somebody else will probably do it.|s^df
mn021|and you can build a a an a a double technology adapter too.|s
mn021|so you can market these double technology adapters.|s
mn021|and this can be a a potential uh um you know uh income too.|s^df
mn081|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|because you just have to license uh uh wavelan technology.|s^df
mn021|you can build uh the whole thing.|s
mn081|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|this u.   u. m. t. s wavelan mixed together.|s
mn081|and|%
mn081|yeah something like that could be possible.|s^bk|s^na
mn081|maybe even a u. m. t. s. to wavelan gateway.|s^cs
mn081|or i'm not sure if that's possible like u.   if u. m. t. s contains redirects or whatever like switches.|s^df^no
mn081|i'm not sure about it.|s^no
mn081|it could be.|s
mn021|huh.|b
mn021|i think they are using different uh radio technologies.|s
mn021|so uh at the physical level they're they're they are not compatible.|fh|s
mn081|it's not a problem.|s
mn081|no but you could have a u. m. t. s gateway that translates everything to that uh local.|fg|s
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn081|if you will.|s^e
mn021|that that's right.|s^aa
mn082|yet the basic idea is in principle to switch seamlessly between wireless lan technology whatever and u. m. t. s.|s^bu
mn082|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn082|and you see the benefit that in principle the customer will save a lot of money.|fh|s^rt
mn082|because if in-house communication like wavelan or maybe i see it also in the american market some wavelan communication in the outer world will be available the and that is your assumption that the more cost uh extensive um u. m. t. s connection could be principle used i would like to say over wavelan.|s^df
mn082|and then i have a normal wavelan connection right?|s|qy^d^g^rt
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn082|and the router and the wavelan connection goes into the core internet elsewhere.|s
mn082|and the connection is not dropped between this seamless hand off i would like to say.|fh|s
mn081|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn082|or what or|%-
mn081|well.|h
mn081|if connection is lost i am i'm not sure if sometimes you'd simply have to drop a connection if you have outstanding connections.|s^no
mn082|what|%-
mn035|yeah.|s^aa
mn081|but that's uh one thing of the internet.|s
mn081|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn081|it's should be able to unplug a host bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be.|s
mn081|i'm not sure if it's uh if you really have to uh save a connection for all applications.|s^no
mn081|i i don't think so.|s^nd
mn082|yeah but if this is the final goal.|s^bk|s
mn082|it should be as much as possible available that you do not have to break the connection if you switch between the subnets' technology.|s
mn082|right?|qy^d^g
mn021|yeah but i i have a point uh regarding the this question is uh the cost function.|s^aa|s
mn021|i mean.|fh
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|what about the user who is switching from one let's say zero cost area network to another network where he has to pay?|qo
mn021|it is okay for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another.|s
mn021|but probably the user wants to be aware that he's switching from one place from one network to another.|s
mn021|because maybe while he's uh having let's say a video conference uh over the the wavelan oh he's not paying any extra cost.|s^df
mn021|but when he continues with this service on the u. m. t. s he's having to cover uh an important let's say an important cost or some cost non-null cost.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|non-null.|s^na
mn021|so uh|fh
mn021|this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of.|s
mn021|of course this doesn't mean that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches to the uh uh from the zero cost area network to to the uh um non-null cost area network.|s^df
mn021|but maybe some users want to do this.|s
mn021|because they say okay.|s^df:s^bk
mn021|i'm not willing to pay any back for this service.|s^df:s^nd
mn021|because i'm just watching uh you know the sports news.|s^df:s^df
mn021|so if i switch if if because of my motion i'm switching or i'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network well i i want the service to be uh stopped.|s
mn021|and this can be some pattern then that some users will follow.|s
mn035|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|yeah but if your|s^bk|s.%--
mn082|uh i believe everybody is aware about the u. s. a. i. a architecture.|fh|s^ng
mn082|and uh this one is here this stuff is here also related to this kind what is mentioned there concerning the end system.|fh|s
mn082|and in my uh considered end system there is a certain kind of policy concerning how to use subnets technologies and and all these kind of things.|s
mn082|how to use quality of service you know in advance.|s^e
mn082|because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services.|s^df
mn082|and that should not be done automatically.|s
mn082|but it could be done automatically.|s
mn082|but nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible that you could set up a certain kind of mini database how to deal with all these kind of things.|s
mn082|i think that's not a problem.|s^ba
mn082|but uh what i i would like to ask wilbert here and we discuss it yesterday is it only the usage of that p. c. m. c. i. a card where you have instead of g. s. m today u. m. t. s and instead of wireless lan today also wireless lan.|s
mn082|remember your four and one card uh concerning um|s.%--
mn082|what is the name from|qw.%--
mn082|no.|s^ar
mn082|dacom.|s
mn081|oh the one i have sitcom?|s^bk|qy^bu^d
mn082|where you can enable four technologies and you plug in in your laptop.|s^df
mn081|yeah.|b
mn082|and then you have every four uh subnet layer technologies available in your laptop.|s^df
mn082|is that the problem?|qy^rt
mn082|yeah that's not the problem.|s^nd
mn082|right.|s^bk
mn081|um|fg
mn081|well the switching itself could be a problem.|s^am
mn082|why?|qw
mn081|well it's a depends.|s^am
mn081|maybe you are.|s^am
mn081|i don't know.|s^no
mn081|so that could be a topic for research.|s^cs
mn082|yeah but this|fg|%-
mn081|so maybe you know more about it.|s^am
mn082|yeah but this is only the probing to figure out that you get at a certain location the information that a certain coverage of a certain subnet technology is available.|s^bk|s
mn082|and if so then what miguel mentions then you add a certain kind of policy to switch or not to switch to this kind of technology.|s
mn081|yeah.|b
mn082|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn082|but this is end system related.|s
mn082|that's not network related.|s
mn082|i see no network related stuff within these in this uh idea.|s
mn081|um|fg
mn082|it's only to set up|s.%--
mn082|for me it's like a laptop to plug one p. c. m. c. i. a and currently will have two p. c. m. c. i. a cards and i compare g. s. m with u. m. t. s.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|and today i would like to have g. s. m.|s
mn082|and then i have my g. s. m connectivity.|s^rt
mn082|and i cannot use it other technology.|s
mn082|only g. s. m because the interfaces the driver interface does not permit me to switch between the between different technologies.|s^df
mn082|so if i want to go to wireless lan i have to stop my connection and put in my wireless lan p. c. m. c. i. a card.|s^e
mn082|and then i can go on and set up the the same connection one more time.|s^e
mn082|and what you have in mind to do it a bit more seamlessly and that makes an only sense for me if both technologies in principle were close together in that sense for application.|s
mn082|for instance the application would be that i have my laptop here.|s^e^rt
mn082|and i work here with with my device.|s^e
mn082|any kind of device.|s^e
mn082|and i work here in wireless lan area.|s^e
mn082|and then i go outside and want to go still on leaving the coverage of uh of the uh wireless lan.|s^e
mn082|and at a certain state the device uh receives certain signals that the coverage of u. m. t. s or g. s. m is available.|s^e^rt
mn082|and at that state you automatically or based on the certain kind of user profile switched to the um u. m. t. s or g. s. m uh network.|s^e
mn082|that's the only senseful application.|s^ba
mn082|from my understanding that means only to have a certain kind of control layer for the different drivers.|s
mn082|which you also mentioned as a u. s. a. i. a architecture.|s^e
mn082|and uh then to do the switching for an existing stream or application between these uh transparently to this application between those uh these both technologies.|fh|s
mn082|maybe there's more potential.|s^am
mn082|i don't see it.|s^no
mn082|but maybe you have a additional idea.|s^am
mn082|and i don't think that this end system device uh architecture which will come automatically.|s
mn082|and i believe there's a lot of activity throughout the world.|s
mn082|because this seamlessly communication is always mentioned elsewhere where you where you listen to.|s^df
mn082|so|fh
mn082|uh|fh
mn081|if if you can leave it out the network that will be really cool.|s^ba^cs
mn081|that's what you what i would like to do.|s^df
mn081|so|fh
mn081|yes.|fh
mn021|but when quality of service comes to the uh scene well i think we have a a bigger problem.|s^nd
mn021|because maybe this this uh uh seamless migration cannot be seamless at all.|s^df
mn021|because maybe the the quality of service we are getting when we are connected to a certain network let's say high-speed networking cannot be sustained when we are switching to a different technology.|s^df
mn021|so this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our our scheme.|s
mn021|or|fh
mn082|now i would like not to hear only three opinions.|s
mn082|but maybe there are also other opinions.|s
mn021|okay.|b
mn021|yeah.|b
mn021|oh sorry.|s^fa
mn082|and maybe everybody should uh give a short|s^co.%--
mn035|i think you|s.%-
mn082|let us understand built for everybody and their whether their comments.|s
mn035|yeah.|b
mn035|i think we should|s^cs.%--
mn035|in this thing of seamless handoff or handovers should think more maybe in different layers?|qy^cs^d^rt
mn035|so one layer is having the seamless handover.|s^df
mn035|it's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service you can't do magic and have it.|s
mn035|there are certain constraints on that.|s
mn035|it's true.|s^aa
mn035|that's still in mind.|s
mn035|but for with the cases there there it is possible.|s
mn035|so that should be made possible then?|qy^d^rt
mn021|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|yeah.|s^aa^r
mn035|so|fg
mn021|it can be done.|s^na
mn021|it is just huh uh trying to to to to to pinpoint the the possible problems.|s^df
mn035|yeah.|s^bk
mn035|there are still enough problems in doing it.|s
mn035|yeah.|s^bk
mn035|yep.|s^aa
mn035|but it might be the wrong thing to promise uh ten megabits to everywhere.|s
mn035|there you are.|s
mn035|but saying okay if it's a if the technology is okay you can do it.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|in fact if you take the slower technology of the ones you are planning to to support you can offer this this uh this throughput as uh the minimum warranty you you can get.|s
mn035|yep.|b
mn035|yep.|b
mn035|yeah.|b
mn021|so if everybody is is asking for less than this minimum amount no problem at all.|fh|s
mn021|but in this case maybe not too much effort should be put on providing this quality of service.|s^cs
mn021|because you just have a usually a huge bandwidth compared on a a with what the user is is using.|s^df
mn035|yeah.|b
mn035|yep.|b
mn035|uhhuh.|b
mn021|i mean if you have a ten megabits bandwidth and the user is asking two kilobits per second of course you can uh build uh certain reserve mechanisms to warranty the user these two kilobits per second bandwidth.|s^e
mn021|but probably in it isn't it is not worth because you have so many uh available bandwidths that maybe uh it is not a problem.|s^e
mn082|oh please come in.|z
mn021|hi.|z
mn035|hi.|z
fn083|huh?|qw^rt
fn083|oh!|s^bk^fe
fn083|okay.|s^bk
mn035|ist fertig.|z
mn082|uh|fg
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|oh okay.|s^bk
mn082|good luck.|s
mn081|the the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those uh four areas.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|and the building blocks.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|multicast not a topic.|s
mn081|so|fg
mn081|so we|%-
mn082|routing?|qy^d^rt
mn081|so so we went through uh uh to through multicast.|s
mn081|so this architecture with|s.%--
mn081|well at least no wireless environment or a mobile i. p environment comparable to uh u. m. t. s environments we really did not find any well difficulties there.|s
mn081|on the blackboard that is.|s^e
mn081|of course in real life there will probably be some problems.|s
mn021|have you have you read about this uh barwan project held at berkeley university?|qy^rt
mn082|well what you the pointer the pointer you sent yesterday.|s
mn081|iceberg?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|i i didn't find the time yeah to do so.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|but|fh
mn082|uh|fh
mn081|you mean the iceberg project?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|barwan.|s^nd
mn081|barwan of uh e. s|s^bk.%-
mn021|barwan.|s^m^na
mn035|how's it start?|qw^rt
mn081|i know there's one that's of uh randy katz.|s
mn021|uh it was another related project called daedalus.|s
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn021|and uh well it seems they what they were doing was some kind of uh things somehow similar to this.|fh|s^df
mn081|they worked together little bit with nokia?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|uh don't know.|h|s^no
mn081|palo alto?|qy^d^rt
mn081|mountain view?|qy^d
mn021|i i i i just uh take a a quick uh look at the at the thing.|s
mn021|because i i was uh read about this uh a long time ago.|s^df
mn021|and it the the latest report i i found was in nineteen ninety eight.|s
mn021|and in this report well they they they have uh some slides some uh papers some well a lot of things.|s^df
mn081|huh.|b
mn021|and well the main thing and the quick uh thing i i was uh looking at was a a video available in m. in m. p. g m. peg format.|s
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|well what this video was presenting was a kind of test of of one guy with a portable computer moving across different networks.|s^e
mn021|so starting at the c. s department at berkeley.|s^e
mn021|and then going out the street.|s^e
mn021|switching to the a campus wide network.|s^e
mn021|uh um i think it's a metricom uh network.|fh|s
mn021|which is uh a test|s.%-
mn082|a ricochet here right?|s|qy^d^g^rt
mn021|ricochet.|s^m^na
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|that's right.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|and then finally switching to i think it was city p. d or something like this.|s^e
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|i as uh as the as the user is moving out of the of the coverage area of this second network.|s^e
mn021|and well what they have built is a a kind of uh proxy structure.|s^e
mn021|so they are they are putting most of the work of this adaptational layer on on the side of the proxies.|s^e
mn021|so the client or the server is not changed.|s
mn021|it is the proxy the one that does the work.|s
mn081|yeah.|b
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so you can even for example use|s.%-
mn021|it's the same?|qy^d^rt
mn082|uh we just discussed a lot about proxies.|s
mn021|oh okay.|s^bk
mn082|that's a fun.|s
mn081|i like them.|s^ba
mn081|so|fh
mn021|okay.|s
mn021|i|%
mn021|it is just that that well maybe we can we can take a look at oh maybe a more in-depth look at this project.|s^cs
mn021|just to see if we are doing the same or if we are doing something similar.|s^df
mn021|it would be important for us to to highlight the differences.|s^df
mn081|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|because if not well they can say oh you are doing the same thing.|s^df:s
mn021|this was done now.|s:s
mn081|or maybe talk to them about operations they thought of but didn't touch yet.|s^cs
mn021|yeah well we are close.|s^bk|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|uh maybe a few comments.|fg|s
mn082|first of all um do you mind miguel to write the name of the project on the whiteboard?|qy
mn021|yeah.|s^ar
mn021|no problem.|s^nd
mn082|so that everybody|s.%--
mn082|uh i i will send also the pointer which miguel sent to me to everybody so that everybody can take a look to this uh project.|fh|s^cc
mn081|i was|s.%-
mn082|and uh i don't know what information is available.|fh|s^no
mn082|because i didn't find the time currently to check it out.|s^df
mn030|it's a project of the u. c.|s
mn082|but first of|s.%-
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|oh yeah.|s^aa
mn021|u. c uh berkeley.|s^na
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|when did you go through this?|qw^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|i'll i you uh i seen uh uh reports from nineteen uh ninety six ninety seven and ninety eight.|h|s
mn081|because yesterday i was uh well coincidentally i bumped into this project here.|s^df
mn021|maybe the project|s.%-
mn021|uh|fh
mn081|it's funny.|s^ba
mn082|uh sorry?|qw^br^rt
mn082|uh do|%
mn081|yeah yesterday i was just surfing a little bit.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|uh.|s^bk
mn081|and then from nokia i came to this that project.|s
mn082|uh.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|i see.|s^bk
mn081|so|fh
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|nokia research.|s
mn021|i think that that the leader was uh professor katz.|s
mn081|and then|s.%-
mn082|okay.|fg
mn081|that's right.|s^aa
mn081|and he's also board in nokia research.|s
mn021|okay.|b
mn081|so|fh
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|then the second thing is that uh daimler-chrysler research here in palo alto as well as in germany ulm is doing in principle the same with a car.|s^t^tc
mn021|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|they have a specific antenna for uh g. s. m oh g. p. s and and for future extended g.   uh g. s. m networks and wireless lan and and other and other network technology.|s^df
mn082|in the roof of the car they have a lot of servers.|s
mn082|in the trunk of the car then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things.|s
mn082|and they are driving around the different areas.|s
mn082|and the same car exists here in palo alto uh based on wireless lan g. s. m and 2x ricochet networks.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|they collect the collect collecting a lot of data concerning the seamless handoffs and whether it works very well with speed.|s
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|uh thomas is going to build mobile i. p stuff in their servers.|s
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|because they want to|s^df.%--
mn082|so i think there is a lot of activities in the area.|s
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|and my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here.|s
mn082|but anyway maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind.|fh|s
mn082|i see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of u. m. t. s know how.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|and you need it definitely.|s
mn082|because then it must be your uh bible i would like to say that you are very familiar with u. m. t. s if you want to go in in that way.|s^df
mn082|and as far as i know the u. m. t. s standardization is not finished yet.|s
mn082|ninety percent maybe or eighty percent.|s^e
mn082|i i'm not sure.|s^no
mn082|but uh|fh
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|let me let me ask you a question about uh u. m. t. s or or third or possible generation wireless communication systems.|s^co
mn082|that|%-
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|uh from the point of view of the user uh is there uh something more that nnn that than more speed?|fh|qy
mn021|is there any other advantage from the point of view of the user or of of the terminals?|qy
mn082|users of of u. m. t. s?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|you can request certain kind of q. s.|s
mn082|you can even request it in g. p. s.|s
mn082|but it's not end to end quality of service.|s^df
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|it is only um what the gateways get.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|yeah.|b
mn082|and within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up in the core network itself of the access provider.|s
mn082|not the internet backbone core.|s^e
mn082|and you use certain kind of tunnel mechanism to combine in principle the base station cluster control.|s
mn082|but this is uh is controlled by a certain kind of node.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|and you have the gateway to the p. d. n or the public data network.|s
mn082|and between both there's a certain kind of tunnel set up.|s
mn021|but in fact|s.%-
mn021|but in fact now at the g. s. m level what you have is that every voice channel you use provides a a a pretty fine fixed uh data speed.|s
mn021|so we can say that every voice channel has an an uh implied um quality of service.|s
mn021|which is nnn ninety six hundred bits per second.|s^e
mn021|full duplex.|s^e
mn082|you mean now for g. s. m?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|doesn't it?|qy^g^rt
mn082|or|qrr.%--
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|so|fh
mn082|yeah what is what means quality of service.|s
mn082|a certain degree.|s
mn082|right?|qy^d^g
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|sometimes we have some|s.%-
mn021|no but um but not only because of of data speed.|fg|s^arp
mn021|but also about delay.|s
mn021|you know.|fh
mn021|because g. s. m networks were developed to uh with a voice service in mind.|s^df
mn021|uh delay is also considered in these networks.|fh|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|uh in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter and a a a specified um data speed.|fh|s
mn021|so you can scale up scale up this uh this um thing by using several channels.|s
mn021|so in fact you have using just g. s. m technology you have more or less the same building blocks as you can get uh with the u. m. t. s.|s
mn021|i mean that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different.|s
mn021|that uh the base station thing is different.|s^e
mn021|and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different.|s^am
mn021|but from the point of view of the mobile things uh i'm not sure if if|s^no.%-
mn082|it's packaged data oriented.|s
mn082|it's not really circuit switched.|s
mn082|in u. m. t. s you have always g. p. s as a a involvement in the core network.|s
mn082|you have in principle the path which still is available for for the g. s. m network.|s^rt
mn082|also they use in principle the same uh the same mechanism.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|but you also have a uh packet oriented communication that's on the g. p. s stuff.|s
mn082|and that's also related to u. m. t. s.|s
mn021|yeah but the you know it is also being uh developed this g.   uh p.   d. p. r. s thing g. p. r. s thing.|s^bk|s^nd
mn082|so|fh
mn082|that is|%-
mn021|which is uh uh packet data over g. s. m.|s^e
mn021|so|fh
mn021|i mean uh i don't see that a a lot of difference.|s
mn021|we can expect a lot of differences uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view uh when uh u. m. t. s be deployed.|s
mn021|what i'm trying to say is that is that well uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a u. m. t. s expert.|s
mn021|because uh i i don't see it i think that the u. m. t. s thing is more a technology issue than a research issue.|s^df
mn021|maybe i'm wrong.|s^am^bd
mn021|just|%--
mn021|um|fh
mn082|no i think there's a lot.|s^ar|s^nd
mn021|explaining my|s.%-
mn082|yeah.|fh
mn082|i think there's a lot of research.|s^ba
mn082|but the question is is this uh a research in which direction we are going?|qy^rt
mn021|i mean to be done here.|s^df^ng
mn082|and because|s.%-
mn082|for|s.%-
mn021|not not at the|s.%--
mn021|of course you know i'm i i agree with you that there are a lot of things to be developed.|s^na
mn021|but but the point is that uh this is probably not here.|s
mn021|because uh well you know the the the orientation of our group which is uh networks services and applications not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology.|s^df
mn030|you think more about hardware technology.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|so there is a lot of hardware to develop but not|s^bu.%-
mn021|you know radio frequency technology.|s^e
mn021|wide band uh c. d. m. a.|s^e
mn021|these kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched.|s
mn021|but uh i don't think this is not something we are doing here.|s
mn082|right.|s^bk
mn082|but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different.|s
mn082|the picture i have in mind concerning u. m. t. s is first of all if you use u. m. t. s only for voice like you did it or are doing now for g. s. m it's not worth to have this kind of network.|s^df
mn082|and currently in europe where it will be deployed first i believe it will be very hard in principle to get some money back if you have only for using it for voice.|s
mn021|voice.|s^2
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|because they paid a lot of money.|s^df
mn082|so|fh
mn082|what is the point?|qw^rt
mn082|the point is that you use the u. m. t. s to connect to the internet and have certain kind of services which are still not available up to now.|s
mn082|but the problem is if you have the internet content and you have maybe your small uh um device of maybe only evolution based for for these uh new technologies for for certain mobile phones then you have certain kind of problems.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|because you cannot use these things.|s^df
mn082|and wap is not an answer for for these kind of things.|s
mn082|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|so|fh
mn082|the i believe there is a lot of research work.|s
mn082|and also if you see the end to end scope of the internet from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server correspondent node or whatever you call this destination then you have certain kind of models for instance for the quality of service and all these kind of things.|s
mn082|and then is u. m. t. s only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology.|s
mn082|and you have to match these things anyway.|s
mn082|it's like a normal ethernet.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|whatever you see it is only an additional subnet layer technology.|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn082|and you have all the things mapped to the uh to to the to the the internet stuff in principle to this technology.|s
mn082|and furthermore you see that the trend is to put more i. p technology really really i. p technology and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations to their access network itself.|s
mn082|and|fh
mn082|there's a lot of potential as i believe for for uh certain research work.|s^ba
mn082|but the question is first of all do we have the competence to do something like that?|qy^rt
mn082|first of all.|s^e
mn082|second we are not hardware builders in that sense to set up certain kind of end systems.|s
mn082|we can design them yeah from the protocol layering.|s
mn082|and and maybe have some simulations or whatever.|s^am
mn082|but isn't the final outcome really such a device?|qy^rt
mn082|prototype linux based.|s^e
mn082|and we go around here and we have maybe a g. p. s. base station sponsored by ericsson.|s
mn082|since they are living not so far away.|s^e
mn082|and and maybe wavelan connection here.|s
mn082|now a testbed.|s
mn082|and then then figure out that it works?|qy^d^rt
mn082|so that's my point.|s
mn081|well just to make the list a little bit longer.|s
mn082|yep.|s^bk
mn081|um you could also think about uh session management.|fh|s^cs
mn081|i do along with uh the network applications and services uh as you might know.|s^df
mn081|it's a a|s.%--
mn081|if you can do it in the end systems or at specific servers then i'm in favor of that.|s^df
mn081|but session management i mean uh the authentication if you go from one network to the other it's not solved.|s
mn081|uh|fh
mn081|nobody really wants a a guest on your network.|s^df
mn081|unless you get some money through some way uh through some way.|s^e
mn081|then there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the barwan project as you said go through proxies.|s
mn081|there might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies.|s
mn081|like the zip uh zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit.|s^e
mn081|that that's i think also in the line of uh session management.|s
mn081|then there is this uh perfect thing uh the berkeley sockets.|s
mn081|it's almost perfect.|s^ba
mn081|they kind of skipped uh layer five uh session management or session layer i think.|s
mn081|that's um normally with if you do a socket programming it's directly the application protocol on layer four uh t. c. p socket or layer five for u. d. p socket.|s^df
mn081|there might also be some research|s.%--
mn081|well.|fh
mn081|could you introduce such a session management?|qy
mn081|or|fh
mn081|what they do right now is they make it part of the application level protocol.|s
mn081|that's what they do most often.|s
mn081|like with session management for mobile the uh applications such as instant messaging or uh talks and so on uh like zip it's just doing a a reconnect.|s^e
mn081|if they think that the network is different or different capabilities come into play they simply do a reconnect.|s^e
mn081|so it's part of the protocol.|s
mn081|that's all what i think about session management.|s
mn081|like part of in proxies or is it embedded in application level protocols.|s^e
mn082|but it's really higher level.|s^bu
mn082|right?|qy^d^g
mn082|it's no more related to a network.|s
mn081|it's|%-
mn082|we are leaving the network area.|s
mn082|that's dangerous.|s^ba
mn081|so how do you want to focus on network services.|s
mn082|because if you go to the|s.%--
mn082|if you|%--
mn082|for me that's starting with middleware aspects.|s
mn082|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn081|well|%--
mn082|and|%
mn081|so network applications if you look at the name of the group one thing is that um they used to call a a a network that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network.|s
mn081|if you look at network from the o. z layer then it's uh level two or something or maybe level three but everything below three.|s
mn081|so there are i think two two different interpretations of uh network.|s
mn082|no i believe network is if you see it really from from the i. p protocol suite is then layer one in principle up including layer four.|s
mn082|despite the fact that layer four is only residing normally in the end system and in the gateways.|s^e
mn081|but are there network applications then?|qy
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|so the the name is network services and applications.|s
mn081|so what could be an example of a network application if you look at the o. z stick?|qw
mn082|yeah we have i think some.|s^bk|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|do you see this word application related to a network?|qh^rt
mn082|or do you see this word independently?|qh
mn082|that was never discussed in detail.|s
mn082|network services and applications.|s
mn082|so everything in the world.|s
mn081|okay.|s^bk
mn082|or is the application related to the network?|qh
mn082|for my understanding and as far as we discussed so such a long time uh these applications should.|s
mn082|for instance ecommerce.|s^e
mn081|okay okay well they will i didn't want to get a discussion now.|s^bk|s
mn082|and it's really really|s.%-
mn082|yeah|fh
mn082|you know?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|that|%--
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|no no uh that is a typical application i think.|s^ar|s
mn082|which is in principle also a little bit related to uh to the network.|s
mn082|but not any application.|s^e
mn082|and we also have the aspects for security.|s
mn082|miguel you mentioned here authentication and and triple a..|s
mn082|but we do not have any expert anymore.|s
mn082|because hannes was an expert for that.|s^df
mn082|so the problem for me it still exists that we have in principle here basic building blocks in the proposal from the networking side.|s
mn082|we could have a certain kind of application.|s
mn082|and there's a lot of activities in the outside world.|s
mn082|and i believe there's a lot of contacts.|s
mn082|or there could be a lot of contacts uh with with these people.|s
mn082|especially at uh georgia tech.|s^e
mn082|i know on next week on tuesday.|s
mn082|tuesday right.|s^r|s^f
mn082|we will go to u. c. b.|s
mn082|there are three guys.|s
mn082|then morgan mentioned one.|s
mn082|i do not know exactly um uh what he is doing.|s^bd^no
mn082|but he's also interesting in some kind of collaboration.|s
mn082|he's also a professor in the u. c. b.|s
mn082|and uh many universities.|s
mn082|maybe claudia mentioned duisburg.|s
mn082|and uh in principle most of the university have some activities in that area.|s
mn082|we will not take care about these one.|s
mn082|but we can use them as um for field uh field trial access.|s
mn082|and and and maybe some support.|s^e
mn082|and and whatever kind of thing.|s^e
mn082|and we focus really on the networking stuff.|s
mn082|and going in more detail in this area.|s
mn082|and the alternative is maybe what uh|s.%--
mn082|currently we have only uh this uh proposal from wilbert to go more in the smaller scope.|s^rt
mn082|figure out some potential from maybe this uh wavelan u. m. t. s stuff.|s
mn082|and and starting from that.|s
mn082|or are there other suggestions?|qo
mn030|i think we uh have already so much work put into this proposal.|s^df
mn030|why to switch now?|qh^ng
mn030|so i don't see the reason for that.|s
mn030|maybe the application we suggested is not the best one.|s
mn030|so we have to think about an application which which is um um for mobile users more relevant.|s
mn030|i don't know.|s^bd^no
mn030|maybe video games.|s^cs
mn030|if you are traveling|s^df.%--
mn030|uh it's boring to travel.|s
mn030|and then you decide to play a video game with somebody else who's traveling.|s
mn082|yeah you know it's still mentioned in the proposal.|s^bk|s^bd
mn030|so|fh
mn082|and|fh
mn082|um|%--
mn082|i i'm sure okay that it is the wrong place to get the foundation why we are use this kind of application.|s^bd
mn082|but uh and in in the end of the text in the end of the text of the proposal.|s^df
mn082|but it is mentioned that it is only an example.|s^df
mn082|and that we use this application in principle while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access to these kind of things.|s
mn082|when you have a video game server and and you want to have mobile access you must at least have one in your consortium or as a partner whatever who provides this service.|s
mn082|and then we we are playing videos in principle if you have a field trial.|s
mn082|and that is i think much more harder than to have a certain kind of certain kind of access to the university.|s
mn082|and uh to this server which is run on the campus of the university.|s
mn030|okay that's right.|s^bk|s^na
mn082|and that is the point.|s
mn082|you can have this to figure out all the things.|s
mn082|and the the um|fh
mn082|and the the um|fh
mn082|um now how to say the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario.|s
mn082|but nevertheless it's not the best for 3x.|s
mn082|and and and and uh|fh
mn082|networking stuff.|s
mn082|you are right.|s
mn082|but it does anybody see certain kind of potential here to go on?|qy
mn082|and to start the work maybe in this little bit smaller oh uh scope based on these building blocks.|s^e
mn082|because multicast you still uh you mentioned that there is no potential.|s^df
mn082|i think it's described here that the potential if you use it for the mapping to the next generation networks in the wireless access area they are still some potential to map multicast.|s
mn082|because they do not use it.|s^df
mn082|and to figure out whether they're useful instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism and to set up these tunnels|s.%--
mn082|and have the mapping between a p. s. d. n uh telephone number or whatever kind of number they are using to i. p addresses and then there's the tunnel i.d.'s|s.%--
mn082|and and all this kind of things i think is very beneficial as well for for telecommunication providers.|s
mn082|as well as for i. s. p.'s.|s^e
mn082|i i think the potential is still there.|s
mn082|you you neglected that.|s
mn082|but i don't think that you are right in that sense.|s
mn081|well think it works.|s^aap
mn081|but uh|%--
mn081|yes the mapping of course between multicasting and the u. m. t. s or or whatever.|s^aa|s
mn082|in next generation?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|that's or c. d. m. a or whatever that's uh yeah probably a thing that has to be find out.|s^rt
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|i don't know what statuses.|s^no
mn081|maybe they already did it as part of u. m. t. s.|s^am
mn081|i'm not sure.|s^no
mn081|i don't have a clue.|s^no
mn081|i i only know how it works on copper and like ethernet.|s
mn081|and on p. s p. p. p over something.|s
mn081|and how it works like that.|s
mn081|but on the wireless i'm not sure.|s^no
mn082|now what do you see about the|qw.%--
mn082|um um|fh
mn082|k. p. n interests.|s^e
mn082|because i believe if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the multicast stuff and k. p. n is very interesting in u. m. t. s stuff and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on but only for the uh i. p. layer technology then why do the mapping of also potential mapping of multicast i think must be of major interest for them.|s^df
mn082|right?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|one question.|s
mn081|yes but if if it's available|s^aap|s.%--
mn081|that means|s.%--
mn081|so so if uh if it's already part of the u. m. t. s standardization then uh it's immediately finished.|s^rt
mn081|like okay you can tell k. p. n well go to ericsson or nokia and buy it.|s^rt
mn081|and if it's not in there yet well it could be a suggestion.|s
mn081|and then the hardware people will make it part like the etsi or whatever where u.   wherever u. m. t. s is standardized they will well go for it.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn081|of course yeah this this group could do that too.|s
mn081|could be.|s
mn081|but|fh
mn021|i have a an important doubt about the i. p availability over u. m. t. s.|s
mn021|i mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing.|s
mn021|and uh i'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation.|fh|s^no
mn021|i mean are they maintaining are they holding the same web technology?|qh
mn021|or are just they discarding this technology?|qrr
mn021|and forgetting about the thing.|s^e
mn021|i i don't know what will happen.|s^no
mn021|uh i i don't have a clue.|s^no
mn021|probably if after searching a little bit on the on the net i can get the answer.|s
mn021|but initially this is something to to to have in mind.|s
mn021|i mean because maybe this u. m. t. s thing will appear on the market without i. p as a native protocol.|s^df
mn021|and if this is the case well thus seamless integration could be strongly affected.|s
mn021|at least uh if you we want to use u. m. t. s.|s
mn021|i'm i'm just uh throwing the question.|s^bd^df
mn021|uh i mean looking for an answer.|s
mn021|because i don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this.|s^no
mn021|i don't know what what carriers are planning to do about this.|s^e^no
mn081|i'm not really sure.|s^no
mn081|but i thought i i had the impression that we can throw away our nokia stuff when our web gateways when we even go to g. p. r. s.|s
mn081|so|fh
mn081|let alone u. m. t. s.|s
mn082|now wap is ja not only related now to available bandwidth.|s
mn081|that's the impression i get.|s
mn082|that's not the only thing.|s
mn082|it's only the adaptation towards the capabilities of the end device.|s
mn082|right?|qy^d^f^g
mn081|yeah definitely.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|so|fh
mn082|uh i never was a friend|s.%-
mn081|but but still a it's a it's a fundamental|s.%--
mn082|huh.|b.%
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|uh it's a part of a of design like the the|s.%--
mn081|the terminal has a wap stick.|s
mn081|and there's a box that has also a a wap stick.|s
mn082|so yeah.|b.%
mn081|and they do sometime most cases they do share an i. p address.|s
mn081|but doesn't uh have to deal with i. p at all.|s
mn081|it's just a thirty bit number.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn081|that actually is an assigned number.|s
mn081|but it's all only used for identification.|s
mn081|that's the only thing.|s
mn081|it's stored in a wap cookie.|s
mn081|much like h. t. p.|s
mn081|in a cookie and from the wap gateway|s.%--
mn081|then it will be h. t. p real h. t. p or something.|s
mn081|so it's it's really a different uh type of connection.|s
mn081|it looks a little bit like uh the the well w. m. l looks a little bit like h. t. m. l.|s
mn081|but that's all what's uh|s.%--
mn081|it's not i. p at all.|s
mn082|right.|b
mn081|because there is a gateway you can access with almost the same microbrowser.|s
mn081|the same uh web servers.|s^e
mn081|if they provide the right content uh spit out the right uh w. m. l language.|s
mn081|so it's it's really a different network technology i think.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|it's transparent in principle what you can carry.|s
mn082|but|fh
mn082|anyway you have the gateway.|s
mn082|it must be uh the uh uh conversion of the media.|s
mn081|yeah.|b
mn081|but|%-
mn082|of the contents in principle.|s
mn082|but i don't see that uh|s.%--
mn082|it's too late i believe.|s^ba
mn082|if wap was available in the beginning of g. s. m then i think it was there would be a good chance that it is well deployed.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|but now the first generation of web-browsers are in the and and uh i would say handies.|s
mn082|so that's wrong in the mobile phones.|s
mn082|but the the next generation of networks are still available.|s
mn082|and the uh the bandwidth constraints are no more applicable.|s^rt
mn081|well|fg
mn081|right now there is still a lot of wap actually.|s^ng
mn082|and|%-
mn081|so that the|s.%-
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|yeah but the hype.|s^aap|s
mn082|but|%-
mn082|pffft|%
mn082|uh|fh
mn081|well users usage.|s^df
mn082|i never saw a user using wap.|s
mn082|please raise your hand who is using wap.|s^co
mn081|my colleagues are.|s
mn082|yeah?|qy^bh
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn081|yeah they are using wap.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|yeah?|qy^bh
mn082|okay one of six.|s^bk|s^bd
mn082|so|fh
mn030|i don't have a mobile phone.|s^no
mn081|yeah.|b
mn082|oh.|s^bk
mn035|who is using mobile phones?|qw^rt
mn081|well you don't have a mobile phone in in the u. s. a here.|s^bu
mn021|no.|s^aa
mn021|no.|s^aa^r
mn081|so that's maybe the reason.|s
mn021|not me.|s^na
mn081|and i'm not i doubt that it's not available in germany.|s
mn081|it's would be unbelievable to me.|s
mn082|now do you yeah do you see the chance for wap?|qy^rt
mn082|i don't see it.|s
mn081|it it is.|s^na
mn081|in in in sweden it is also there.|s^df
mn081|and in the netherlands it is also available.|s^df^e
mn021|huh.|b
mn081|every provider provides|s.%-
mn021|in spain it's available.|s^aap
mn021|but uh you know uh my main complaint has been all the time that it is difficult to me to believe that i can do interesting work with a 4 lines display.|s^bd^df
mn021|uh maybe check the lottery result or something like this.|s^cs
mn081|oh.|s^bk
mn081|yeah but|s^bk|%-
mn081|oh!|s^fe
mn081|i'm the first one to admit that's a that it is a hype.|s^df
mn021|but|fh
mn081|but and but i'm i just wanted to say it is being used.|s^df^rt
mn081|but if it makes sense to me and to especially to have wap in in between no.|s
mn081|i'm not a supporter of it.|s
mn021|huh huh-huh.|b
mn081|so they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ascii bytes that can refresh the screen with a different animation every well second a few times.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|so that's that's true.|s^na
mn081|i immediately agree.|s
mn081|but the thing was you just asked well will will it be the same will there be wap for u. m. t. s and so on q. p. r. s.|s^df
mn021|well|%-
mn081|and well i don't have the answer.|s^no
mn021|i i don't know what will|s^no.%-
mn081|but i thought it was not.|s
mn081|i'm just it's weird it's weird to stop doing it with g. p. r. s.|s
mn035|yeah.|b
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn035|but usually wap shouldn't is so general that it can be used with u. m. t. s.|s^df
mn035|so if you still want to use wap with u. m. t. s you might be able to do it.|s
mn035|but|%-
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn035|that shouldn't be your only way of|s.%-
mn082|there's a you can put the gateway.|s
mn081|if you want to do it in a in a mobile phone want to implement it as a light stack or something.|s
mn082|yeah.|b.%
mn082|yeah.|b.%
mn081|yes?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|yep.|s^aa
mn081|sure.|s^aa
mn035|but usually that's not the reason to have u. m. t. s.|s
mn081|no not not if you have a big uh web pad or something.|s^aa|s^na
mn035|yep.|s^aa
mn081|then you there there's an i. p stack in it.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn081|and|fh
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|so maybe i would like to ask claudia|s^t^tc.%--
mn081|huh.|b
mn082|you read the proposal in the meantime?|qy^bu^d^rt
fn083|yeah but the task changed really a lot.|s^aa|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
fn083|so i'd i rather would like to|s.%-
mn082|yes that's right.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|and do you have some comments on it?|qy
mn082|from the next this is version zero dot five right yeah.|s^e|s^bk
fn083|yeah but i'd rather like to follow the discussion before i gave any comments.|s^bk|s
fn083|because it's really the first point is it's much more than it was before i left.|s^df
fn083|so it's like five weeks in between so it's like that whew.|s:s^fe
fn083|that big now.|s
mn082|that's right.|s^na
fn083|and it really changed a lot.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
fn083|because the i mean i found the classroom inside.|s^df
fn083|but the thing where i left the discussion was that we are talking about uh a classroom where you know everybody could look on with any kind of device and follow lectures or do exercise or whatever.|s
fn083|so|fh
fn083|now we are talking about something which is much more precise.|s
fn083|and the the range of stuff is maybe more narrow than before.|s
fn083|so i'd rather like to to follow it a bit and then to get more into the ideas.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn081|can i do another one like|qy.%--
mn081|u. m. t. s or wireless generally are will be more expensive.|s^tc
mn081|and especially u. m. t. s.|s^e
mn081|if they want to get back the money.|s
mn081|so is it maybe a research topic to focus on the|s^cs.%--
mn081|not really billing of course.|s
mn081|i wouldn't|s.%--
mn081|but at least the different application of protocol based usage.|s
mn081|so you have uh one connection one application uses f. t. p whatever.|s^rt
mn081|bit voice or some other|s.%--
mn081|that those type of application you may might want to make more out of a megabit per second or something.|s^cs
mn081|could that be something?|qy^rt
mn081|or|qrr.%--
mn082|also we want to go more in the triple a. area right?|s|qy^d^g
mn082|because billing alone|s^df.%--
mn081|or is|%-
mn081|no well it's|s^ar|s.%-
mn082|or or um billing is related to accounting.|s
mn082|accounting is related to authentification and authorization.|s^rt
mn081|yeah that's true.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|so|fh
mn082|and then you are still at the triple a. service uh activity.|s
mn081|yeah that's right.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|and nobody is has the skills to deal with that.|s
mn082|and then we are leaving our scope anyway.|s
mn081|okay.|s^bk
mn035|my impression on this proposal is that every single block has some research done already.|s
mn035|so multicast this means that there are many things done.|s
mn035|oh what was it?|qw^t1
mn035|maybe i was routing mobility management.|s
mn035|but no one actually put them together.|s
mn082|yeah that's|s^aa|%-
mn035|but so that's the big problem.|s
mn082|that is a|s.%-
mn035|but the problem with this problem might be that it's too big.|s
mn035|to put all these big pieces to|s^e.%-
fn083|what do you mean by put together?|qw
mn035|so that you really have a complete a complete scenario.|s
mn082|as it what i mean the synergy effect right?|s|qy^d^g
mn082|from from|%-
mn082|yeah.|b
mn035|you have in one scenario multicast quality of service routing and mobile um networking.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
fn083|uh.|b
fn083|uhhuh.|b
mn035|not just the islands alone.|s
fn083|so why i wasn't|s.%--
fn083|well yeah uh hold myself back a bit with comments is uh because when i left the discussion the discussion was what to to have something like a big umbrella about everybody who was at this point here.|s^rt
fn083|and so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now.|s
fn083|and there i had the impression the umbrella was this kind of classroom thing.|s^bu
fn083|right?|qy^d^g^rt
fn083|or wrong?|qrr^d
mn082|yeah in principle it is related to the current state.|s^aa|s
mn082|but the networking stuff is more explained in much more detail.|s
fn083|yeah yeah yeah it is.|s^aa|s^na
fn083|of course.|s^e
mn082|and the work packages are better oder what could be derived for work packages is much better aligned.|s
fn083|yeah.|b
fn083|yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
fn083|that's that's clear.|s^na
mn082|but that has not changed yeah?|s|qy^d^f^g
fn083|yeah that's that's clear.|s^aa|s^na
fn083|but then i don't get|s.%--
fn083|because when we were discussion discussing this uh stuff weeks ago uh i had the impression that you know everything of these work packages uh fit together under this one big umbrella.|s^df
fn083|and now it sounds different.|s
fn083|so that's what i don't understand.|s^no
fn083|uh but it's also because i missed the last four weeks.|s^df
fn083|so|fh
mn082|yeah the problem is if you|fg|s.%-
fn083|it's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks.|s
mn082|yeah okay maybe one sentence one sentence.|fg|s
fn083|why it changed so.|s^e
mn082|if you're focussing on the argument chain as follows i have an application.|s
mn082|this application has certain kind of requirements.|s
mn082|these requirements are maybe multicast and and and quality of service and mobility.|s
mn082|access and then mobility management.|s^e
mn082|and that is it.|s
mn082|i want to focus on it.|s
mn082|then you have in mind that or you must have in mind that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this.|s
mn082|that you can use it with every application.|s
mn082|and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom it must be fit end to end.|s
mn082|and if you assume something like we discussed it very hard with with multicast that you assume that multicast will be available at certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet.|s
mn082|otherwise it makes no sense.|s
mn082|and we come to the conclusion okay uh multicast we must deal with both approaches.|s:s
mn082|that you have uh application layer multicast.|s
mn082|as well as maybe some other multicast and maybe really multicast.|s.%
mn082|and then the point is how to select these mechanism if you want to have not a certain kind of access to the server elsewhere in the network you want to use any application.|s
fn083|so if i understand i it right what has changed is before we were focussing on|s.%--
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|and|%-
fn083|so because what's difficult for me is what is meant by application.|s^df
fn083|so because i have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining application in different way.|s^df
fn083|so what exactly is mean by application?|qw
mn082|the application for instance here that uh the interactive classroom.|s
mn082|but elsewhere any application in in in any kind of video audio.|s
fn083|yeah.|s^bk
fn083|oh okay.|s^bk
fn083|so what has changed|s.%-
mn082|or whatever kind of game server.|s^e
mn082|what kind of interactive multimedia especially uh downstreaming applications maybe uh video on demand then uh whatever kind of application you can consider.|s
fn083|so what has changed is that we're not only focussing on this intelligent classroom but on everything.|s^bu
mn082|not on everything.|s^arp
mn082|that's not true.|s^nd
mn082|but we|s.%--
mn082|that's why we say here that we have a certain kind of uh possibility to change in the access networks.|s
fn083|uhhuh.|b
mn082|that means the wireless networks.|s
mn082|because that provides in principle the mobility.|s^df
mn082|and these|s.%--
mn082|and you see that there's a trend to provide i. p functionality more and more in these kind of networks.|s
mn082|but the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um technology only for the access network.|s
mn082|you have to have in mind always the end to end scope.|s
mn082|and if you see for instance we have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things|s.%--
mn082|especially also for multicast.|s
mn082|different things really for different providers.|s
mn082|and uh and it's uh very easy to change it maybe in the access network for novel things.|s
mn082|for instance that's one provider domain.|s
mn082|and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain.|s
mn082|so it means that packet are delivering information.|s
mn082|and you do not have the separation of routing and and and forwarding process.|s
mn082|it's impossible to deal with that in the whole internet.|s
mn082|because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible.|s^df
mn082|so how to combine these uh potential um extensions in the um access networks and|s.%--
mn082|without losing the end to end scope in the internet.|s
mn082|then you can have certain novel features.|s^rt
mn082|give the providers like k. p. n or whatever the the potential in principle to to uh see the building blocks for the future networks.|s
mn082|because there's a three third generation like u. m. t. s a fourth generation more i. p related.|s^df
mn082|there will be a fifth generation i'm sure.|s
mn082|and then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network.|s
mn082|if you ever really full i uh uh full i. p end to end.|s
mn082|but nevertheless you can only not only focus on okay i provide this mechanism.|s:s
mn082|because you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet using any application.|s
mn082|and then this mechanism must fit it there.|s
mn082|but nevertheless uh internet backbone is in the meantime based on its success.|s
mn082|impossible to change.|s
mn082|you see the difficulties with i. p version six.|s
mn082|uh uh you see the difficulties with multicast.|s
mn082|they are discussed since you know ten years or whatever.|s
mn082|the specification are rather stable and and available.|s
mn082|but we have only islands in that.|s
mn082|we cannot assume that everything is end to end available.|s
mn082|and so you have to to have to have in mind that certain kinds of mechanisms are maybe at a certain stage end to end available.|s^rt
mn082|maybe we have a lucky that the islands are connected to each other.|s
mn082|or the same applies for m. p. l. s for instance.|s^rt
mn082|maybe they are only portions available.|s^rt
mn082|how to deal with that when the islands are not available?|qh
mn082|and maybe nothing is available.|s
mn082|but you have to select it.|s
mn082|because i have a mobile phone a mobile node or whatever kind of device.|s^df
mn082|and i want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet.|s
mn082|so is it possible to have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with.|s
mn082|i always say that the success of internet make it unflexible.|s
mn082|it's impossible to change something very easy.|s
mn082|it's easy maybe more on the access network as in the internet backbone.|s
mn082|so that is uh overall picture that we have in mind with these things.|s
mn082|and we can not|s.%--
mn082|we we are six people.|s
mn082|or seven or whatever.|s^e
mn082|if hannes come.|s^e
mn082|we are not able to solve the problems uh in in uh in the few years or whatever.|s
mn082|what the whole internet community has um done in in since uh since a decade.|s
mn082|but we can pick up some some um potential and and and to start with something.|s
mn082|and that's my missing point.|s
mn082|that we have here in principle really the description of this problem i mentioned.|s
mn082|and focus really on the reasonable size of the project.|s
mn082|maybe in the first stage for the n. s. a core itself.|s
mn082|and maybe possible extension from for instance if k. p. n say yes that's great.|s:s
mn082|that's the right direction.|s^e:s
mn082|we will support that.|s^e:s
mn082|and if siemens say okay great we will support it.|s:s
mn082|and and what it|s.%--
mn082|huh university of berlin or something.|s
mn082|and maybe university of mannheim or duisburg.|s
mn082|or in spain oder whatever.|s
mn082|so if we have all the similar project then you have only to take care about that's a little bit aligned.|s
mn082|that there's some transparency concerning the results.|s
mn082|and and the activities are literally going in the in the same um pace.|s
mn082|so that's the basic idea.|s
mn082|but really it's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it.|s
mn082|that's the point.|s
mn082|and if we get some funding back|s.%--
mn082|and we have certain uh potential partners in the boat|s.%--
mn082|okay we can go to a broader scope of this whole thing yeah.|s
mn021|let me let me propose a a a a reasoning way.|s
mn021|uh let's assume that we are successful with this proposal.|s^rt
mn021|so we get the funding to do whatever what we want to do.|s^rt
mn021|so my question is what we want to do is|s.%--
mn021|let's assume that we have the funding.|s
mn021|what will be our first and or or and second steps?|qh
mn021|uh what kind of things uh we uh we will buy?|qh
mn021|what kind of things we will uh program or we will deploy?|qh^e
mn021|because answering this these questions we can know much better what the application we want.|s^df
mn021|so let's assume|s.%-
mn082|yeah but the problem is that funding is the second step.|fg|s^ng
mn081|huh.|b
mn081|well i'm not sure.|s^ng
mn081|i i i think i agree with him.|s^ng
mn081|but uh right now we're looking at a you want to do a big thing instead of a great thing.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|so if you assume that it should connect uh really good to siemens and to uh k. p. n and to the then it starts to get big we should all go to the in the same direction.|s
mn081|if you already assume well okay they paid money and now you think okay what what great thing you want to do then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to do.|s
mn082|yeah but we have no uh current no public funding.|fg|s^df
mn081|no.|s^ar
mn082|okay everybody's paid here.|s^f|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn035|yeah but but|fg|%-
mn081|but you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align k. p. n with siemens for instance.|s^df
fn083|yeah.|b
mn035|yeah.|b
mn035|but|%-
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn035|but for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question if we would have the money what would we do with that.|s
mn081|uh|%-
mn035|so if we don't know what we would like to do with the money we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|that's right.|s^na
mn021|absolutely.|s^na
mn082|that's right.|s^na^r
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn035|so that's why i think yeah it's a good question.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|now that's the point why i am focussing on more on the|s.%--
mn035|yep.|b
mn082|yeah|fh
mn082|i want to have really the activities.|s
mn082|you know what is really the outcome?|s^f|qh
mn082|what is really the problem we are going to solve?|qh
mn082|these are my questions.|s
mn082|and if we have identified this block then it is possible to raise some money.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn035|that's just the same question just other way around.|s^na
mn021|let let me put an example.|s
mn021|you know i some days ago i bought like some of you this kind of things.|s^rt
mn021|this is a p. d. a.|s
mn021|uh three com uh palm pilot compatible.|s
mn035|modernistic stuff.|s^ba^t1
mn021|nothing nothing that great.|s^ba^bd^rt
mn035|completely useless.|s^ba^t1
mn021|but it has some some possibility of being expanded.|s^df
mn021|but the point is uh the only in here the only thing wireless thing i can put on on this is just uh this omnisky modem.|s
mn021|which is uh i think it is a subscription based uh thing.|s
mn021|you have to pay every every month.|s
mn021|and uh of course i cannot imagine that uh tomorrow i'll be able to buy a different thing with four different networks.|s
mn021|four different providers on it.|s^e
mn021|maybe i'm wrong.|s^bd
mn021|but|%--
mn021|if i have the funding i say okay well i can buy this or even i can buy a mobile computer.|s:s
mn021|a notebook.|s^e
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn021|a lot more expensive.|s^ba^rt
mn021|but that's okay.|s^ba^df
mn021|i have the funding.|s
mn021|then i can add a couple of cards at most.|s
mn021|because huh the majority of the of the notebooks only have two p. c cards uh type two slots.|s^df
mn021|so|fh
mn021|in in the better case maybe i'm only able to add two different networks to this thing.|s
mn021|so uh|fh
mn021|the difficulty i see is that uh if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um maybe we are uh too advanced too um let's say uh too in advance for the current technology.|s
mn021|which is not bad.|s^ba^rt
mn021|but uh i'm just saying that it will be able it will|s^df.%--
mn021|sorry.|s^fa
mn021|it will be difficult for us to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology.|s^df
mn021|if somebody tell us okay now here you have the thing and just put these four networks you want on the thing how can i do it now?|qh:s
mn021|so huh|fh
mn021|i'm still trying to you know to get used to the uh all the ideas.|s
mn021|and to see that all the things are really connecting.|s
mn021|because this the uh most difficult thing i see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align.|s^df
mn021|so that's why i was proposing this this question.|s
mn021|let's assume we have the funding.|s
mn021|now let's proceed.|s
mn021|what what kind of things we can buy we can put together we can program?|qh
mn021|because oh at the end uh somebody will uh be asking us okay did you do your homework.|s^df:qy
mn021|did you do what you|s.%--:qy.%--
mn021|so|fh
mn082|it's clear.|s
mn082|now from my point of view in the beginning one more time if i see the four building blocks and uh i could speak only for my skills i believe to derive a certain kind of q. s reservation in advance scheme much more uh general as it is done for for u. s. a. i. a.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|but mapped then really to desired network subnet layer technologies.|s
mn021|but for different networks?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn082|yes.|s^aa
mn021|the point is for|s.%-
mn082|for|%-
mn082|no for u. m. t. s.|s^ar|s^rt
mn082|but first of all a generic system.|s
mn082|but because you can have several mechanism.|s^df
mn082|really using certain kind of of um um quantitative description.|s
mn082|you can have more of a qualitative description.|s
mn082|you can have taken into account moving patterns.|s
mn082|and and and whatever kind of things.|s
mn082|but there are a lot of lot of ways to have certain kind of q. s reservation in advance.|s
mn082|and i see it as definitely is necessary to have this one.|s
mn082|if i want be mobile and i want to have not a interruption of my in my application qualities of service.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|so|fh
mn082|um|fh
mn082|but then to go for instance to u. m. t. s and figure out what is available within u. m. t. s.|s
mn082|and if i really have an i. p application where i need this kind of of quality of service and having in mind that certain kind of q. s will be available in the rest of the internet|s.%--
mn082|so how can i map these things uh to the u. m. t. s stuff?|qh
mn082|and what is the trend towards u. m. t. s to the first generation?|qh
mn082|and how it is possible to map this one to this technology?|qh
mn082|and if you have the building blocks identified what is really necessary for q. s uh q. s. in advance for for mobile systems then you have in principle the ideas for the following generation what you could improve.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|because then you are maybe no more related to this kind of thing.|s^df
mn082|i believe the same applies for multicast.|s
mn082|and i believe the same applies for routing.|s
mn082|so in principle in the beginning there would be a certain kind of uh paperwork anyway.|s^cs^rt
mn082|some theoretical examination of these problems.|s^cs^e^rt
mn021|i think so.|s^na
mn082|and then some prototypes must be derived from that.|s^e
mn082|and then maybe we will start here with a certain kind of uh testbed equipment we still have here.|s^rt
mn082|we have four uh p. c.'s available.|s
mn082|maybe we have to extend it then.|s^rt
mn082|and figure out some real scenarios.|s^rt
mn082|and maybe then pfff.|s:s^fe
mn021|oh yeah.|s^bk
mn082|because uh despite the|s^df.%--
mn082|uh uh hopefully then we have with the money also not uh only for the room.|s
mn082|that would be great.|s^ba
mn082|but there are also some sponsors then then then we add a certain kind of field trial.|s
mn082|but i think that's pfff that's years you know.|s
mn021|a long way yeah.|s^2|s^aa
mn082|that's years.|s^r
mn021|that's right.|s^na
mn082|but in the beginning we must have a certain kind of theoretical framework with the relevant technology.|s^cs
mn082|real technology.|s^e
mn082|maybe you can start with g. p. s or or u. m. t. s or whatever.|s
mn082|because these technology will definitely available in europe.|s^df
mn082|there's some money spent on it.|s
mn082|so that it will be in a certain kind of flavor.|s^df
mn082|it will be available.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|and it will be also available in the u. s. a.|s
mn082|because there is a big uh harmonization effort.|s^df
mn082|despite the fact they are not aligned to each other anyway.|s
mn082|but they will have also certain kind of third generation and fourth generation networks.|s
mn082|so|fh
mn082|and after this theoretical framework if this one is aligned okay you have some specification.|s
mn082|and you set up some linux or free b. s. d or whatever kind of prototype.|s
mn082|so that is what i have in mind with that.|s
mn082|and then okay and then you will see.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|the problem is which i see is that it could be fruitful to standardization.|s
mn082|that it could be fruitful to some extent to telecommunication providers.|s^rt
mn082|but there's not a real product like you say.|s
mn082|there's not the selling idea behind it.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|if you go with something what what wilbert mentioned okay let's have this one here we have a new p. c. m. c. i. a card and and extend something and the end system or what you mentioned here was the seamless four technologies inter working in the end then you have an an a device which you can sell.|s
mn082|if you go for a networking pfff um uh improvements in principle and and understanding next generation building blocks uh there's no product.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|but it is a long term it's long term i think uh work you can do.|s
mn082|and it's more related i believe to the skills.|s
mn082|to what is available.|s^e
mn082|and and currently as i see what uh will be available within the n. s. a group.|s^e
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|and uh the point is if we focus on on this networking small more networking stuff and them some application guys came into the boat and they focus on their application stuff whatever this means it might be we have then the active classroom.|s
mn082|but it could be another one.|s
mn082|that is not representative.|s
fn083|yeah but there's something needed to sell it.|s^aap|s^ng
mn082|it's only|%-
mn082|huh?|qw^br
fn083|and i think|s.%-
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|then then is something available.|s^aap
mn082|but i don't know.|s^no
mn082|you know i'm not an application expert.|s^df
mn082|i|%--
mn082|we have some content.|s
mn082|we will then discuss it on next tuesday as i mentioned.|s^cc
mn021|bless you.|s^t3
fn083|bless you.|s^t3
mn082|uh anyway but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available.|fh|s
mn082|the good thing is that the money is available.|s
mn082|because everybody is paid here.|s^df
mn082|so that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|but first of all wilbert need more definitely.|s
mn082|because maybe then k. p. n is uh no more interesting to go on with this work.|s^df^rt
mn082|or we can convince with these kind of things which we have in mind.|s
mn082|uh companies like k. p. n.|s^e
mn082|so|fh
mn082|and if we have other suggestions and uh have this as a long term|s.%--
mn082|n. s. a core group activity.|s^e
mn082|and this theoretical framework whether it is finished in half a year or one year doesn't matter in principle.|s
mn082|because the road map for the the next generation networks is is uh is for many years.|s^df
mn082|and before u. m. t. s will be deployed very well i believe uh it will be common uh two thousand four or something like that.|s
mn082|so|fh
mn082|and and have an intermediate project which is related in this direction something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever.|s
mn082|this is a smaller portion in the more generic framework i would like to say from this proposal.|s
mn082|why not go in this way?|qh
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|i i don't know.|s^no^rt
mn082|but uh that's the point uh we are sitting here together.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|but|%-
mn082|but for for dietmar i think uh uh he mentioned it to me it's very clear that he will go on with a portion of time with this u. s. a. i. a stuff.|s
mn030|that's right.|s^na
mn030|it depends on my|s.%-
mn082|in the matical sense.|s^e
mn082|because that means for you in a certain kind a certain extent you are decoupled from networking stuff.|s^df
mn082|because your focusing on the mathematical thing of whether it's a network or other thing.|s^df
mn030|well i'm|s.%-
mn082|it doesn't matter.|s
mn030|i'm focused on performance evaluation.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|and um especially of communication networks.|s
mn030|and|fh
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|i never uh um dealed with um mobile communications.|s
mn030|so why not?|qh
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|so|fh
mn030|so that's uh to open my mind.|s
mn082|there is it still ongoing activity with uh maybe a portion of time at the university of berlin berlin.|s
mn082|and independently whether i will leave the uh uh i. c. s. i in in the mid of december or not i will still focus on on on these q. s. in advance schemes.|s
mn082|uh also within siemens.|s^e
mn082|and also with some project there.|s
mn082|and i believe your routing stuff is also available.|s
mn021|huh huh.|b
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|and when you when you will go back to spain right?|s^bu^e|qy^d^g
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|yeah sure.|s^aa
mn082|yeah so and and that's why in principle the skills will be always available i guess.|s^bk|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn021|and and|%-
mn082|if there is a certain type of project in the home countries and then the uh institutions and|s.%-
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn021|not only this.|s
mn021|we can even use this platform to to get some european projects in the future.|s^cs
mn021|because you know sometimes uh it's a good thing.|s^df
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|maybe.|s^am
mn082|currently no money is available you know.|s^bd^df
mn021|yeah but uh this will i think this will improve over time i'm sure.|s^aa|s^df
mn021|so uh|fh
mn021|probably.|s^am
mn021|you know this kind of joint work of different countries companies universities this is usually the best uh the best place to to put a project on.|s
mn021|because it is involving different partners from different points of of europe.|s^df
mn082|now i will not prevent anybody from getting some cake.|s^na
mn082|and we are sitting here together.|s
mn082|it's uh very uh very slow in principle.|s^ba
mn082|but my last question is for wilbert.|s
mn082|wilbert you i i think you got the basic idea.|s
mn082|because it was mostly discussed with you here from this current available scrap project proposal.|s^df
mn082|don't you think that k. p. n could be convinced to go on this way what i mentioned before?|qy^bu^rt
mn082|there's no way.|s^e^rt
mn081|no.|s^ar
mn082|they needed definitely in principle some kind of service or device or product or whatever.|s
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn081|that's right now the the status.|s^na
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn082|can we both have together maybe i think it's a little bit more easier a discussion on thursday?|qy^rt
mn081|i'm out for one a week and a half.|s
mn081|so on wednesday thursday friday i have a workshop at stanford.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn081|and next week i have a week on holiday.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|maybe that's enough time for you to consider a little bit more in this direction.|s^cs
mn081|could be.|s^am
mn082|and then we could have uh discussion.|s
mn082|and maybe this one is an overall work in principle where everybody could hook in and and get certain kind of small portions to solve it.|s
mn081|yeah.|b
mn081|so so the only solution would for for k. p. n would be that there is a a project in this area.|s^bu
mn082|and|%-
mn081|so that makes sense to do in this this i mean the bay area.|s
mn021|huh huh.|b
mn081|with a group of uh a few people.|s
mn081|like four or something.|s^e
mn081|and that connects to this project.|s
mn081|so one somebody or two some bodies can be found uh founded or get money to join this project.|s
mn081|but that the other four should build a service on top of it that has a clear business focus.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn081|it means uh a a u. m. t. s service basically.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|can you consider also in the meantime some potential u. m. t. s services besides this one?|qy
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn081|yeah but you see the the they ask something pretty strange.|s^aa|s^nd
mn082|and|%-
mn081|they they want something pretty strange from me that i think of a service.|s
mn081|a network service.|s^e
mn081|there are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day.|s
mn081|and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start-ups or whatever.|s
mn081|and just think of a service like that if i could do this.|s
mn082|no but uh fff maybe based on this one and you see the networking stuff.|s^ar|s
mn082|that it is a little bit more evolved and than in the the core network technology in the access network i would like to say.|s
mn081|uhhuh.|b
mn082|and this is aligned then as much as possible to the internet.|s
mn082|that's the basic idea.|s
mn082|that you can have a certain kind of service which make use of these novel things.|s
mn081|uhhuh.|b
mn082|because normally i i believe the the the people are either on the application layer.|s^df
mn081|i you know|%-
mn082|that means higher than layer four.|s^rt
mn082|or they are on layer one to up to layer four.|s
mn082|and the service people are considering|s.%--
mn082|okay u. m. t. s.|s
mn082|you have some location information.|s
mn082|and maybe you are have the infrastructure in the car.|s
mn082|so if i provide a certain kind of service independently what the network is offering you know.|s
mn082|because they do not consider it very well.|s
mn082|they know there is a certain kind of location information.|s
mn082|and you have a g. p. s.|s^rt
mn082|and they know okay it's based on satellite.|s:s
mn082|and there's u. m. t. s that is based on base station.|s^e:s
mn082|there's all that they consider.|s
mn082|and then assume okay i can do that.|s:s
mn082|and the networking guy said okay it would be great to have multicast and all these kind of things in the network.|s:s
mn082|but do not consider really what a sense of benefit uh for applications.|s
mn082|there were new old application make use of it.|s
mn082|and how can new application arise.|s
mn082|which we haven't considered up to now based on this new network function l. a. t enrich enriched network function l. a. t.|s^e
mn082|so i think it's worth to to consider something in that way.|s^cs^rt
mn081|well until now i have been trying to think about it.|s
mn081|but uh to me|%--
mn081|what i have every every time i encountered it it is all this is all pretty close by.|s
mn081|like the industry is already behind this.|s
mn082|yeah what is our|fg|qw.%-
mn081|so they they want to make this available pretty soon.|s
mn081|so i'm just trying to think uh more ahead like uh use the wireless device as a only as a signalling thing or something.|s
mn081|so so whenever you come in with your uh g. s. m phone and there is a p. c available like everything will be directed to the the bigger device or something.|s
mn081|so more services like that.|s
mn081|i think they are working pretty hard to get i. p available very good and efficiently from uh two mobile devices or wireless devices.|s
mn082|not currently there is a technology split.|s
mn081|a thing|%-
mn082|of course you have i. p in the mobile device.|s
mn082|but if you see the strange protocols text.|s
mn082|there's i. p over i. p and tunnels and and whatever.|s
mn082|so but it's uh looks very strange to me.|s
mn082|because you have different numbering screens concerning you have a phone number.|s^df
mn082|you have to map it to i. p addresses.|s^df^e
mn082|and and so on.|s^e
mn082|but for me you have not the end to end parts of for for i. p functionality.|s
mn082|we are far away from that.|s
mn082|and if you take a really look to the g. p. r. s protocols texts and i believe also they apply for u. m. t. s but i'm not|s.%--
mn082|uh very familiar with that.|s
mn082|and the next generations access network is will come soon.|s
mn082|you see it's every three years or four years they will have a new generation.|s
mn081|and there's a we|s.%-
mn082|but anyway you|s.%-
mn081|our group might want to focus on the uh i. p over ether no nets.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|or something like|s.%--
mn081|or over ether.|s^e
mn082|why?|qw
mn082|what kind what kind i. p over what do you call it?|qw
mn081|no nets.|s
mn082|no net?|qy^bu^d^m
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|that would be great.|s^ba
mn081|over|%-
mn081|like only over ether.|s
mn081|carefully integrated for net.|s
mn081|but there is no net.|s
mn081|if you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end i. p available that could be a vision.|s^rt
mn081|like|fh
mn082|can you repeat it?|qy
mn081|well so he he says well i. p to i. p or end to end i. p is far well it's far away.|s
mn081|um|fh
mn081|so you what you might want to do is well get u. m. t. s out there.|s
mn081|and just do uh i. p.'s playing over radio.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|something like that is my final vision.|s
mn081|like like s. d. h i. p over fiber or w. d. w. d. m.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|.|%
mn081|this gets rid of the s. d. h.|s
mn081|or well start with get rid of the a. t. m first.|s^rt
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|a. t. m stuff.|s^2
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|and then get rid of s. d. h.|s^rt
mn082|there's the problem is is you see that the providers uh have always there broken view for for the management.|s
mn082|if you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff in principle but you still need it is uh not aligned.|s
mn081|yeah.|b
mn082|we have it for different islands.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b.%
mn082|and and|fh
mn082|well that's my final vision you know.|s|s^f
mn082|if you have really then i. p networks at a certain generation where you have really the physical media and where necessary uh additional maclear protocols.|s
mn082|and then you have really always end to end.|s
mn082|it makes you things much more simple much more easier.|s
mn021|uh|fg
mn082|uh but is far far away you know.|s^df
mn021|unless unless we speak about quality of service.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|which is not uh embedded on on i. p services.|s^e
mn082|yeah but you have the extension for the uh quality of service mechanism.|s^aap|s^df^nd
mn021|yeah but|s^aap|s^df^nd.%-
mn082|which you have to map then to the underlying technology.|s^e
mn021|yeah but for example nobody's really using r. s. v. p.|s^aap|s^df^nd
mn082|and|fh
mn082|yeah but maybe in the lan interface it makes.|s^aap|s^df^nd
mn082|since to use it|s^df.%-
mn081|uh you guys do that discussion later on please.|fg|s^cs
mn082|and and but|%-
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn081|uh?|qy^d^g^rt
mn082|but i think we we will miss the cake.|s
mn021|okay sorry sorry.|s^bk|s^fa
mn081|r. s. v. p.|s^e
mn082|and i think we should stop now but please everybody|s^cs.%--
mn082|short|%--
mn082|uh|%--
mn082|go on with considerations and potential.|s^cs
mn082|and and uh|fh
mn082|um we didn't make much progress today in the meeting.|s
mn082|but anyway this kind of activity lives from all from the input of all.|s
mn082|and so i really|s.%--
mn082|if somebody has an idea send an email.|s^cs
mn082|and then i would like to enforce everybody|s.%--
mn082|not that i'm doing everything.|s^bd
mn082|i could not i didn't have the time in the past.|s^df
mn082|and i will not have it in the future.|s^e
mn082|and maybe i will stay here only four weeks or five weeks.|s
mn082|so it would be really not the best thing if the activity is dead when i am leaving.|s
mn082|and if i stay longer of course we can go on.|s
mn082|but nevertheless i rely heavily uh also from the contributions of everybody.|s
mn082|and it's in their own interest.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn021|that's right.|s^na
mn082|so if there is certain kind of idea or questions or whatever we are only a small group of people.|s
mn082|we can easily join on a white board and and start a discussion.|s
mn021|well if klaus|s.%-
mn082|it must not be on every tuesday you know.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|at a certain time.|s^e
mn082|and i try to motivate the people.|s
mn082|that it's free.|s
mn082|that's a starting.|s
mn082|that's a ramp.|s
mn082|and we can go in different directions.|s
mn082|and if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or u. m. t. s or whatever great.|s
mn082|if not the long term and then these things must be nevertheless must be defined in much more detail.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|so thanks.|s^ft
mn021|okay.|b
mn081|okay.|s^bk
mn082|please do not um what adam mentioned to.|s
mn030|not to switch off.|s^2
mn082|uh switch off.|s^e^m^na
mn081|don't switch it off.|s^na
fn083|do not don't switch it off.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|yeah that's right.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|so maybe i will find him.|s
mn021|oh can you call adam?|fg|qy
mn082|cake area.|s
mn021|at this number.|s^e
mn082|and|fh
mn082|now let me see whether he will be here.|s^cc
mn082|and|fh
mn082|we did not forget.|s
mn082|we are done.|s
me011|yeah just leave them on for now.|s^bk|s
me011|sometimes if you turn it off while it's recording it crashes.|s
mn082|okay okay.|s^bk
mn082|hopefully everything went fine.|s^ba^rt
mn021|okay.|z
mn082|okay.|z
mn082|we can start?|z
mn021|okay.|z
mn082|okay.|fg
mn082|so welcome to our next meeting.|s^rt
mn082|uh today we will have a talk from miguel sanchez concerning his uh work related to ad hoc networks.|fh|s^rt^t
mn082|we have here a guest a former icsi member of the n. s. a group jordi domingo pasqual.|s
mn082|he is uh assistant professor at u. p. c.|s^rt
mn082|and maybe jordi you have a few words concerning your work.|s
mn082|one or two sentence.|s^e
mn082|and because we will have tomorrow a talk from him in more detail concerning what's going on.|s^df
mn040|uh you you want me to say|qy^bu^d.%--
mn082|yeah only a short introduction.|s^aa|s^df^na
mn040|oh.|s^bk
mn082|very short introduction please.|s^cs^e
mn040|of course.|s^bk
mn040|uh well i'm working in the them broadband|fh|s.%-
mn082|uh sorry one interruption.|s^fa|s
mn082|this is not related to hearing.|s
mn082|it's only for fixing it.|s
mn082|it's not a earphone.|s
mn040|uh it's not a hear|s.%--
mn082|no.|s^aa
mn082|so|fh
mn040|it works like like this.|s^bu
mn082|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn082|like this one.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn040|uh.|s^bk
mn082|it's only a microphone.|s
mn040|that's|%-
mn040|uh.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|b
mn040|that's uh much more comfortable.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn040|thank you.|s^ft
mn040|i'm uh working in the broadband communications group.|s
mn040|and uh|fh
mn040|uh|fh
mn040|well the research topics at this moment is uh i. p. eighty traffic monitoring and characterization and them uh tool developing tools uh for quality of service uh performance analysis.|fh|s
mn040|that's uh and we have several projects uh both spanish and european projects ongoing.|s
mn040|uh in this area.|fh|s^e
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|thank you.|s^ft
mn082|and after the talk of uh miguel i will give you all a few slides concerning the project proposal.|s^cc^rt
mn082|i will um say something about in which direction it will go.|s^cc
mn082|and|fh
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|maybe it was my fault that i assumed that the pointer of miguel concerning u. m. t. s services was deployed to everybody.|s^am
mn082|but it was only sent to me.|s
mn082|so in the meantime everybody got i believe this pointer from me.|s
mn082|and|fh
mn082|maybe we it's a homework in principle for the next meeting to get a little bit familiar with these things.|s
mn035|worse than no work.|s
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|so i believe we will not have today a very hard technical discussion.|s^t
mn082|maybe more a few topic and items we will focus in the next days until the next meeting.|s^t
mn082|and when we are ready with our meeting.|s
mn082|everything is done.|s
mn082|then uh we have to read these number.|s^t
mn082|and we go around here every member.|s^df^t
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn082|so|fh
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|miguel please.|s^co^t^tc
mn021|thank you.|s^ft
mn021|well uh i i have prepared uh a really short talk about some of the topics.|s
mn021|i i have been doing some some research work uh before coming here.|s
mn021|and uh well mainly i will present.|fh|s^cc
mn021|uh here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation.|s
mn021|i will present some ideas and some concepts about what ad hoc networks are.|s^cc^rt
mn021|about the issues in media access control in wireless networks.|s
mn021|also about routing in such kind of networks.|s
mn021|and uh i will make some comments also about uh the current standards of wireless local area networks.|fh|s^cc
mn021|and finally i will present the blueprint of of my research project or my research uh proposal here.|s^cc
mn021|so the first thing is uh what an ad hoc network is.|fh|s
mn021|you know uh an ad hoc network is made of wireless nodes.|s^df
mn021|these nodes of course can be mobile nodes.|s^df
mn021|and uh in this network there is no network infrastructure.|s^df
mn021|so uh the only active thing we have is the mobile nodes.|fh|s
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|end to end communication is sometimes uh done by direct communication from one node to the other.|s
mn021|because they can talk to each other.|s^df
mn021|but sometimes it is not possible this direct communication because nodes end uh source or and destination nodes are um are too far away.|s
mn021|and in this case it can be done communication can be done by uh using multi hub routing.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|an intermediate or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|uh in a sense what we have in this kind of networks is that uh nodes are as both arced as both uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes.|fh|s
mn021|and this makes a uh difference from other kind of network.|s
mn021|and well regarding the purposes of what can this kind of network be used for uh we can say that well cellular networks are infrastructure based networks.|s
mn021|in this kind of ad hoc networks we don't have anything uh with the exception of the network nodes.|s
mn021|so this uh network can be useful for uh uh occasions where no available infrastructure is present.|s
mn021|like for example in in uh after some kind of of uh um catastrophic event.|s^e^rt
mn021|or also when even when there is a network available we don't want for different reasons to use the available network.|s^e
mn021|this later case can be for example the use in military systems.|s^e
mn021|where maybe we don't want to use the other the enemy network infrastructure for evident reasons.|s^e
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|huh?|qw
mn082|but you can also i believe uh to have an ad hoc network where one node is then connecting to the outer world.|s
mn082|for instance what i have in mind you have a car where you plug in different devices and they talk to each other for instance.|s^df
mn082|but one device decided to go to the g. s. m network or g. p. s network or whatever kind of things.|s^df
mn021|that's okay.|s^na
mn082|so there's a certain kind of task uh for one node within the ad hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world.|s
mn082|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn021|that's okay.|s^na
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|that's perfect you know.|s^na
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|this in this case we will say that this node is acting as a as a external gateway from this network to connect to other networks.|s
mn082|right.|s^bk
mn021|and of course the underlying uh protocols can can be of course uh i. p. based.|s
mn021|uh okay.|fh
mn021|here you have several several uh proposed uh scenarios for for used this networks.|s
mn021|when no network is available.|s^e
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|and another another application for example nasa is is uh studying is uh the use of these networks these ad hoc networks for sending multiple probes uh um uh missions.|s^e
mn021|so for example all of you are aware of this uh the last atlas the last successful uh mars mission.|s^e
mn021|the cellular vehicle was only one and was uh walking around uh roaming around the base station which in this case was the gateway uh node of this network.|s
mn021|but it was only one mobile node of course.|s
mn021|nothing prevents.|s
mn021|except well maybe the cost to send not only one mobile rover but ten tons of them or or at least uh several of them.|s^e
mn021|so uh|fh
mn021|higher area could be covered could be explored.|s
mn021|and uh of course all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad hoc networking ad hoc routing to extend the distance the maximum distance than uh a single radio transmission will would allow.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|and in the other case or the other area uh of of of application is the so-called network of sensors.|s
mn021|where we can deploy a set of sensors in a maybe uninhabited area.|s^e^rt
mn021|let's say for example the forest.|s^e
mn021|and we can uh take some information.|s
mn021|uh for example for for fire fighting we can just launch from a plane several small sensors.|fh|s^e^rt
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|these sensors can be for example uh checking that there is no fire.|s^e
mn021|they can have some kind of uh let's say infrared technology sensor.|s^e^rt
mn021|so we can cover a huge area with only a small set of of sensors and without any other infrastructure.|s^df
mn021|yeah?|qy^d
mn030|um is that really an ad hoc network?|h|qy^rt
mn030|because the sensors are not moving.|s^df
mn030|and i think it's makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are.|s^ba^df
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|so|fh
mn021|well|fh
mn021|you know it's an interesting question.|s^ba
mn021|uh the the main thing about an ad hoc network is not that nodes move.|s^ng
mn021|it is the way of topology changes can happen.|s
mn021|the idea that huh any change is possible at any given moment.|s^df
mn021|but you can of course ask but if the nodes are not moving what kind of topology changes can we expect.|s:qw
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|that's it.|s^na
mn021|well uh the thing is that usually in in a in a network of sensors what we have or the idea is to have um an important number of sensors and maybe with a high filer rate.|fh|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|maybe the batteries are uh exhausted in some nodes because maybe uh they are not being able to take uh let's say any sun to recharge its cells.|s^e
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|uh maybe some of them can be uh just uh out of order for other uh environmental conditions.|s^e
mn021|so uh the idea is that even when these nodes are not moving they can start and stop working at uh let's say higher pace.|fh|s^df
mn021|then uh what will happen in a in a regular network uh in a network where you don't have or either mobility or uh this uh on off uh rate high rate.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|let me go back to your uh uh example.|s^co
mn030|huh.|b
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|have in mind some routers are burnt here at icsi or whatever kind of thing.|s
mn082|what will happen then even in a fixed network?|qw
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn082|so if some sensors are getting out of uh service and whatever kind of thing so the topology has changed even if no node is moving.|fh|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|fh
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn082|and how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things within this network.|s
mn021|thank you joe.|s^ft
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|i see.|s^bk
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|well|fg
mn021|uh you know and finally uh another nonmilitary applications where uh maybe a network is available like for example a room like this.|fh|s
mn021|where we have in in fact a wired infrastructure.|s^e
mn021|but this uh possible application of ad hoc networks could be uh any place any meeting room where we arrive with our computers.|s
mn021|and uh we just can communicate seamlessly to each other without any kind of access point any kind of uh huh external network.|s
mn021|because the kind of work we want to do is just only local based.|s^df
mn021|it's only to chat to each other or to exchange files with the person which is in front of us.|s^df
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|but we don't want to product provide uh access to the internet or something.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|and of course the same uh the same scenario could also happen in a place where there is no uh infrastructure available.|s
mn021|let's say a meeting room uh in in the middle of the desert.|s^e
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|without any other network.|s^e
mn021|so|fh
mn021|the point or or the question could be for some of us the idea of saying okay.|s:s^bk
mn021|that sounds okay.|s:s^na
mn021|but why not to use a longer transmission range so we can reach any destination in just one hop?|qh^cs^rt
mn021|this seems to make sense because well uh we are this way avoiding all the routing problem.|s^df
mn021|that well we will talk a little bit uh about routing later.|s
mn021|but uh|fh
mn021|it it seems that probably that the problem is is not an easy one.|s^ba
mn021|because uh a node's moving the route is changing.|s^df
mn021|so one can think that routing in this uh scenario is is a complex thing.|s^df
mn021|but the problem is if we just uh try to put more power in each transmitter.|s
mn021|so this uh transmitter can reach any destination in only one hop.|s
mn021|what we are doing is uh to rising the power needs of each node.|s
mn021|and also we are reducing the network uh throughput.|s
mn021|because we are only allowing one one transmission at a time.|s^df
mn021|because uh well we cannot allow several transmissions several high-powered transmissions at the same time.|s^df
mn021|because one is interfering with the other.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|we are|%-
mn021|uh i think i'm not telling it yet.|s
mn021|but we are assuming that we are using a single common channel for all the nodes.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so that's why we cannot allow several transmitters in the same channel at the same time.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so the idea of having a longer transmission range is not a good one.|s^ba
mn021|or at least it has the drawbacks um um i was telling you.|s
mn021|uh let's speak a little bit about the media access issues in in wireless networks.|fh|s
mn021|uh you know the easiest uh way to to show how this works is or at least one of i think one of the easiest is that this drawing or this picture.|fh|s
mn021|what what we have is a set of nodes each one at a different location.|s^df
mn021|at at at a at an at a given moment this uh node this dash node is is transmitting.|s
mn021|and uh the arrows are representing this transmission.|s
mn021|and the receiving nodes these three nodes are receiving the transmission.|s
mn021|and i'm trying to uh show the area the covered area for of this transmission by means of this uh dashed uh line circle.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so uh any transmission has a maximum transmission range.|fh|s
mn021|and uh in the simpler way we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter and a certain radius.|fh|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|the value of this radius is uh in principle is a fixed value.|s
mn021|and it depends on the uh power of the transmitter.|s
mn021|of course uh this is only our uh simplified model.|s^bd
mn021|and of course this can be uh improved uh a lot.|s^bd
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|and in fact the real behavior is not exactly this one.|s
mn021|but uh for for what i want to say it's it's okay.|s
mn021|it's enough.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn021|so|fh
mn021|what are the differences uh in this in this uh wireless transmission regarding uh to the wireless to the wired ones?|qw
mn021|what what are the the main differences?|qw
mn021|well the main differences come from the fact that uh in uh in uh wireless transmission we have a special domain we don't have when we are using a wire for transmitting a signal.|s
mn021|and the point i'm trying to show in this picture is that if for example this other node wants also to transmit while this one was transmitting if we are using some kind of carry detect scheme like for example c. s. m. a or something uh uh derivated from it the problem is that this node will hear the the the transmission media.|s^df
mn021|it won't be able to hear anything.|s
mn021|so he will conclude that no other transmission is going on.|s^rt
mn021|and he will start transmitting.|s
mn021|and if he does what will happen is that this node and this other node will also receive this transmission.|s
mn021|and this will produce at least at these two nodes a collision or a a a a a bad reception.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly received at this node nor at this other node.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|uh this problem is what is called|fh|s.%--
mn021|oh sorry.|s^fa
mn021|uh the|fh|%--
mn021|i think this is the previous one.|s^rt
mn021|this is the german|s.%-
mn082|uh|fg
mn035|no.|s^ar
mn035|one|%-
mn082|yes.|s^aa
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|this one.|s
mn021|thank you.|s^ft
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|this is what is called a hidden terminal problem.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|because well uh this node is not able to hear this other node because of the distance uh between them.|s^df
mn021|but uh this problem as you can see in the in the picture is uh really producing at least some reception problem at these two nodes.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so it is it is a problem that we have to address.|s
mn021|and it is a new problem compared to wired uh media access control.|s
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|well some some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions.|s
mn021|and the main idea is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|we are um reserving a certain and a specific uh area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time.|s
mn021|okay.|fh
mn021|this is the basic idea.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|um|fg
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|miguel can you give some examples for such kind of protocols?|qy^cs
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|yeah in fact|s^aa|s.%-
mn082|one is really really|s.%-
mn021|this one.|s
mn021|this one next slide is|s.%--
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah yeah.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|in uh the the the main idea and and the base of most of this protocols is what this the so-called r. t. s c. t. s uh dialogue.|s
mn021|the idea is that|s.%--
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|of course this is only intended for unicast transmissions.|s
mn021|i mean only for when a node wants to transmit something to a neighbor node.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|but not to broadcast uh to all the nodes.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|for this for this uh work the transmitter has to send a a a reservation packet called r. t. s request to send before uh being able to send data.|s
mn021|and the receiver is expected to return back another packet called c. t. s clear to send to allow the transmitter to send the data.|s
mn021|if the transmitter receives successfully the c. t. s packet from the destination then it will be able to send uh the packet the data packet.|s
mn021|if not it will uh back off and it will retry uh sometime later.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so the main idea|s.%-
mn082|and the media is is is still occupied during that period?|qy^d^rt
mn082|or|qrr.%--
mn021|uh|h
mn021|yes.|s^aa
mn021|yes.|s^aa^r
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|the idea is uh if i want to send you something i first of all i need you to answer me to be sure that you are my neighbor now.|s^df
mn021|because maybe you are off or maybe you are uh too far away.|s^df
mn021|and also because that way miguel for example it may be is not being able to hearing me will hear your c. t. s and will know that you are about to receive uh data from me.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn021|so|fh
mn021|in fact forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a a reception is taking place.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|fg
mn082|i didn't get it.|s
mn082|um what happened when i sent an r. t. s packet?|fh|qw
mn082|is then the media still occupied for me?|qy^rt
mn082|or is anybody allowed also to send r. t. s packets?|qrr
mn021|or everybody|s.%-
mn082|because if i go to an intermediate node maybe you are communicating to me.|s^df
mn082|and i am the intermediate node to the final destination michael.|s^df
mn082|and michael send also some r. t. s packet in the time and and uh uh uh jordi too and whatever.|s^df
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|then you will never come to a really|s.%--
mn082|then you're always exchanging r. t. s and non acknowledgement packets for the r. t. s.|s^df
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|two two things.|s
mn082|so that's uh that's uh my my problem.|s
mn021|first of all uh this this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism.|s
mn021|so it is not connected with routing uh anyhow.|s
mn082|then fine.|s^ba
mn021|and second point.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|uh|fh
mn082|so it's only related to the direct neighbor within the scope of the transmissions.|s^bu
mn021|r. t. s|s.%-
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|r. t. s packets can collide to other r. t. s packets.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so this mechanism is not uh preventing collisions.|s
mn021|it is preventing only data collisions.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so the|%-
mn021|and and you can say okay.|s:s^bk
mn021|but what is the what the benefit is.|s:qw
mn021|the benefit is that uh r. t. s packets and c. t. s packets are short packets.|s
mn021|really short packets.|s^e
mn021|let's say uh uh 30 bytes or less.|s^e
mn082|i assume so.|s^na
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|while data packets can be much much bigger.|s
mn021|let's say uh one k. five k.s.|s^e
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|so|fh
mn082|fine.|s^ba
mn021|a collision in this short packet is only wasting a small amount of time.|s
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|if that way we can warranty that there is there are there is no collision uh uh between data packet well this this is this means a a huge uh increase in network throughput.|s
mn021|because well we we only waste really small time colliding.|s^df
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|but that means in principle that on the mac layer you have always a r. t. s c. t. s packet between neighboring nodes.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|and you send afterwards the data.|s
mn082|but the data will be maybe delayed in the intermediate node because you have always be assured to be uh uh uh r. t. s and c. t. s packets are changed before before you can forewarning the data.|s^bu
mn082|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|it is a reservation mechanism.|s^df
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so|fh
mn021|if reservation doesn't work okay if uh one reservation don't succeed then uh this transmission should have to wait.|s
mn082|now the|s.%-
mn021|until the reservation|s^e.%--
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|let me|s^co.%-
mn082|maybe it's better to to uh draw it on the|s^cs.%--
mn082|oops.|s^ba
mn021|let me|s^co.%--
mn082|so maybe my idea first.|fg|s^cs
mn082|so this is what node one?|qy^d^rt
mn082|this is node two.|s
mn082|and this is the source.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|and this is node three that is the final destination.|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn021|forget forget about routing.|s^co
mn082|yeah?|%
mn082|yeah yeah.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^aa
mn082|but anyway i would like to do that in the ad hoc network.|s^cs
mn082|this is maybe the this is within the scope of this uh special network.|s^rt
mn082|that means here that is uh within the transmission power.|s^df
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|so if i send an r. t. s and get back um a c. t. s then he is allowed to send data right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn021|a c. t. s.|s^2
mn021|that's okay.|s^na
mn082|so in the meantime when he gets this one he also had to send r. t. s and then c. t. s.|s
mn082|because this is the next scope of the transmission area.|s^df
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|and then he can send the data right?|s|qy^d^g^rt
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|that's the case?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|that's it.|s^na
mn021|that's|%-
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|and that's what i mean.|s
mn082|in the meantime he still can get some data here where he try to get certain connectivity on the mac layer.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|yeah but uh a node is only is only involved in one transmission at a given time.|s^bk|s^nd
mn021|so|fh
mn021|if now two has uh huh answer with the with the c. t. s it will be waiting until the data that has to come.|s^df
mn082|yeah?|qy^bh
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|and then he try to forward this data.|s^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|after that.|s^e
mn021|but not before.|s^df
mn082|so he is definitely first to stop.|s^bu
mn082|he has to collect all the data.|s^bu
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|yeah you cannot|s^aa|s.%-
mn082|could it not be a little bit strange?|qy^rt
mn082|because if that is starting a file transfer with millions of bytes he have to collect all the bytes before he forwarding to to whatever.|s^df
mn021|no no no.|s^ar
mn021|but we are we are talking only about a data packet.|s^df
mn082|huh?|qw^rt
mn082|one data|s.%--
mn021|at the mac layer.|s^e
mn082|he have to do it for all data packets?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|so but in principle when he receives the data packet then he the same applies for the next data packet.|s^bu
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|all the packets.|s^na
mn021|all unicast packets.|s^e^na
mn082|but anyway in the meantime he has to forward the packet to the final destination.|s^bu
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|that that true.|s^aa
mn082|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn021|that's true.|s^aa^r
mn082|so it's acting in in|s.%-
mn021|but not in the meantime.|s^e
mn021|after receiving you know in fact probably the routing protocol will need to check the address the the let's say i. p address which is inside the data packet.|s
mn082|okay.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|so|fh
mn021|you cannot usually you cannot uh read the data packet until you the reception is over.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|because usually your network hardware only provides you a copy of a packet after a a successful reception.|s^df
mn021|and usually you know that reception is successful if every bit has passed the c. r. c check.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|you have checked that the that this frame has received uh without errors.|s
mn082|naja to to|%
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so|fg
mn030|um a further question.|fg|s
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|um|fh
mn021|that's okay.|s^ba
mn030|am i right that this um dialogue does not prevent um any disturbance of other nodes in the um sending range of yeah n. one?|qy
mn021|yeah let me let me put some special representation of what we are doing.|s^aa|s^co
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|this is the transmitting node.|s^rt
mn021|this is the receiving node.|s^rt
mn021|and these two areas of course there's something like this are the uh places of the total space where you can hear the here this one is the r. t. s and this one is the c. t. s.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|so any node|s.%--
mn021|for example this node is a neighbor of the receiving node.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|but it is not a neighbor of the transmitting node.|s
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|that's it.|s^bk
mn021|so when this node hears the c. t. s transmission that is performed by the receiver this will be uh informed that a a reception is taking place in in in it's area.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so|fh
mn021|in fact this node will avoid any further transmission until uh this reception that will start in in a moment is over.|s
mn030|but then this node um this transmission is uh aborted.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|and delayed.|s
mn030|and so there's no advantage to uh if it's aborted by by any data packets.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|so this um node has to stop each transmission.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|so even the at the moment ongoing transmission.|fh|s
mn021|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn030|is that right?|qy^g^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|so his transmission is aborted.|s^bu
mn082|yeah but this is typical for mac layer protocols you know.|s
mn021|not|%--
mn021|no.|s^ar
mn021|no.|s^ar^r
mn082|that's|%-
mn021|let me let me let me show you one thing.|s^co
mn021|if this node was transmitting before it should uh it should uh transmit an r. t. s packet in advance okay?|s|qy^d^g^rt
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|so this node should hear it before.|s
mn030|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|that's right.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|so this node is won't be sending the uh uh c. t. s packet to the transmitter.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|so this transmission won't take place.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|it's always true that only one node gets a media access for one frame.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn082|that's the point.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|we always said from data.|s
mn082|but it's really one frame.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|fh
mn082|okay.|fh
mn021|and in fact uh there is another detail.|s
mn021|it is not uh uh uh uh in on the on the slide.|s
mn021|and it is that both the r. t. s and the c. t. s packet uh have a field a control field where the total length of the data packet is shown.|s^df
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|so|fh
mn021|when you hear one uh c. t. s or one uh r. t. s packet you know that the frame that they are trying to transmit or that this one is trying to transmit this one is about to receive you know the length.|s
mn021|you know the bit rate.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|so you know that the amount of time you have to wait until you can try to get the control or try to send your own transmission.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|but this scenario is also uh only working if um both or all nodes have the same range of transmission.|s
mn030|so the same radius of the sending range.|s^df
mn021|huh yeah.|h|s^aa
mn030|so otherwise um this one node maybe um would hear his neighbor but not vice versa.|s^bu
mn021|uh well we are assuming that uh huh all the all the transmissions are bidirectional.|h|s^nd
mn021|i mean uh you know it depends.|fh|s^am
mn021|it depends mainly on on the antenna gain and the transmission power and the receiver uh threshold.|s^am^df
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn030|but i'm thinking about this example you gave before.|s^ng
mn082|maybe maybe you are right.|s^am
mn021|so what what we are assuming is that all the nodes behave exactly the same regarding to uh transmission and receiving signals.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|but miguel this is a good point from from dietmar.|s
mn030|yeah.|b
mn082|but maybe here is a wall.|s
mn082|and this guy is behind the wall so his transmission rate is something like that.|s
mn021|yeah but but|fg
mn021|yeah.|fg
mn021|but the but in this case you know this this idea this uh geometric idea can be can be if you want uh deformed because of some obstacles.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|but this wall is working both ways.|s
mn021|it is not only making this node not to hear this one it's also making this one not to hear this node.|s^df
mn030|but one of the|s.%-
mn021|so|fh
mn021|if they|s.%--
mn021|because of this wall if they are not neighbors well we can represent this putting this node like here.|s
mn030|but one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|no but this is not the scenario we are assuming.|s^ar|s^ng
mn030|so|fg
mn030|okay.|fg
mn030|so that was my question.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|okay.|b
mn021|we are assuming all the nodes are exactly the same.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn021|uh so they transmit the same power.|fh|s
mn021|and they uh have the same uh uh sensitivity.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|so they can hear|s.%--
mn030|okay.|b
mn021|if if if i can hear you you can hear me.|s^e
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|and and the opposite works also.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|if you cannot hear me i cannot hear you.|s^e
mn030|but|fg
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|it's a assumption it's it's clear.|s
mn030|but on the other hand um in a real world it isn't or|qr.%--
mn030|um|fh
mn021|in a|qy^d.%--
mn030|in real scenarios uh you have to|s.%-
mn035|it it is actually|s.%-
mn021|uh not really.|h|s^nd
mn021|but also depends on uh you know for example power relationships and antenna relationships.|s^df
mn030|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|you know uh|%--
mn030|uh that's it.|s^na
mn021|because|%-
mn030|a car or|s.%--
mn021|because for example uh one kind of thing|s.%--
mn021|okay if i use a directional antenna this is making that in one direction.|s^bk|s
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|i'm getting more uh let's say more gain than another.|s
mn030|yeah.|b
mn021|and that's true.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn021|but that what is also true is that one directional antenna works both ways.|s
mn030|that|%-
mn030|you're not assuming this.|s
mn030|yeah.|b
mn021|it provides you more gain when you are transmitting but also when you are receiving.|s^df
mn021|so in general in general even when if there uh if there are different antenna gains uh you're getting mainly bidirectional channels.|s
mn021|only when you have an important uh power difference is when um the communication can only work one way.|s^df
mn030|yeah.|b
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn021|for example you have one big station with uh a lot of transmission power.|s^e
mn021|and then you have a really small mobile uh thing that can hear perfectly the signal from this uh uh bigger station.|s^e
mn030|yeah.|b
mn030|yeah a cellular phone and a car.|s^bk|s
mn021|but it has not enough power to transmit something that can be heard here.|s^e
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|yeah.|b
mn021|so um|fh
mn021|but this this this is not our scenario.|s
mn030|okay.|fg
mn021|in our scenario all the nodes are exactly the same.|s^df
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|okay.|b
mn021|they they have the same uh signal uh behavior.|s^df
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|so|fh
mn021|this is not a problem for us.|s
mn021|at least for the moment.|s^e
mn021|maybe later we'll see some differences.|s^am^e
mn021|so|fh
mn021|you know the idea is that this mechanism is a reservation mechanism.|s
mn021|and what we are doing here is try to reserve the area of space we are covering.|s
mn021|and uh here's where our some of our work is done.|s
mn021|the main idea for for our work is well if we are using this reservation mechanism we are reserving an area of space for a single transmission.|s
mn021|uh if this area is bigger than what is really needed we are somehow wasting a little bit of space.|fh|s
mn021|so uh|fh
mn021|our first uh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values.|s
mn021|these uh the area the covered area for a single transmission trying to get a minimum value.|s
mn021|so we can reduce the not used space for other simultaneous transmissions.|s
mn021|and this will lead us to a a better to a better network throughput to higher number of simultaneous transmissions.|s
mn021|and we have uh huh worked about this problem uh in two different uh ways.|s
mn021|one of these ways has been try to find a mechanism to uh calculate an optimal value for the transmission range uh and to get an equal value for all the transmitters.|s
mn021|so the idea in this first work was to obtain a fixed value for the transmission range.|fh|s
mn021|and the second uh work uh it is about|s.%--
mn021|oops.|s^ba
mn021|it is about uh an algorithm to adapt the transmission power for for every single transmission.|s
mn021|so uh in this second part of our work we are using a different value for every single transmission.|fh|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|first point what we have proposed is a way to obtain the transmission range uh for uh for an escenario where we know the number of nodes.|s
mn021|and the area of deployment we have a a fixed area where we deploy all the nodes.|s^rt
mn021|we have a fixed number of nodes.|s^rt
mn021|and uh we assume that these nodes are moving freely around this this area.|s
mn021|and uh what we have presented is a mechanism to uh calculate to obtain the uh transmission radius that provides at the same time that provide us the better throughput possible.|s
mn021|the better possible throughput.|s^bsc
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g.%
mn021|but without our network getting partitioned.|s^e
mn021|which is a problem that we are trying to avoid.|s^e
mn021|you know if we have because of node motion we have something like this.|s^df
mn021|this is the deployment area of or or node.|s
mn021|and if we have some nodes here and some nodes here well maybe these nodes in this area cannot reach the nodes on this other area.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|uh so what can we do to avoid this?|qw
mn021|of course we can choose uh our transmission values longer enough to reach from so the nodes from this area will be able to reach the nodes on this other area.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|but again we can assume that uh if uh nodes are moving uh more or less uh in a random fashion this configuration is not very likely to happen.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so the point we what we have done is to present a mechanism would which provides uh one uh value for a given uh huh probability.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so we can say that uh a given uh value are for for the transmission range will be okay for a given number of nodes if we sorry for a certain for a certain probability.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so the point is uh we cannot say that this is not going to happen.|s
mn021|what we can say is this is not very likely to happen if nodes move uh uh random.|s^df
mn082|yeah but um miguel if uh in the previous slide you mentioned that you uh are working also on adaptive power control.|s^bk|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|is it not possible then if i send something and i could not find any neighbor because one of the cluster below?|qy
mn021|this is the next.|s
mn021|yeah|s^bk|%-
mn082|is it not possible to extend the power until the maximum?|qy
mn082|and if uh i do not have any connectivity with the maximum of power okay then i'm lost anyway.|s^bu
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yeah yeah.|b
mn021|but this is this is a way that it is it is being explored by other researchers.|s
mn021|but not not uh by me.|s^df
mn021|but uh there is uh one at least one person who is who is doing what they call topology control.|fh|s
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|and this is uh related to to uh the control of the transmission power to get uh certain properties uh from your network.|s
mn021|like for example they are what they are doing uh is uh some people working for b. b. n.|s^e
mn021|ram ramanatan is the researcher.|s^e
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|and the article is is uh i think from from this year.|s^e
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|these guys are doing uh what they call uh b. connected networks.|s
mn021|they are trying all the network nodes to have at least two neighbors.|s^df
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|and they are controlling the power to uh this uh huh get this this number of neighbors.|s^df
mn021|but this is not what i am doing.|s
mn021|and uh the kind of power control i am doing uh um is more or less presented here.|s
mn021|and what we are doing is to transmit uh with the minimum power needed depending on the distance to the destination.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|every transmission is supposed to be done to a certain neighbor node.|s
mn021|we cull the neighbors to these nodes which are uh closer than a given distance.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|and because we wanted to to compare our algorithm with something we needed to compare it with the no power control.|s
mn021|which is the usual uh mechanism at this uh media access control level.|s^e
mn021|so what we are doing here is to to compare our mechanism against the no power control.|s
mn021|but again we have to fix|s.%--
mn021|in order to be able to compare we have to fix a given whatever but a given uh maximum transmission range to compare.|s
mn021|and uh what we are doing is we are uh taking the advantage that we are we have this r. t. s c. t. s dialogue in advance before sending the data to uh agree with the receiver the power level he is willing to get from us.|fh|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so every single transmission in every single transmission we are checking with the receiver the power level we have to use for the data transmission.|s
mn021|that's the main thing.|s
mn021|and as uh|s.%-
mn082|and how do you|qw.%--
mn082|sorry miguel.|s^fa
mn082|how do you check if if the nodes are moving randomly?|qw^rt
mn021|well uh we are assuming that for at least for uh uh you know uh car and and walking or or people riding a motorcycle the um frame length is so small that only um very very small um space can be can be uh travelled while the transmission is taking place.|s
mn021|you know.|fh
mn021|in one|s^e.%-
mn082|yeah okay.|s^bk
mn082|maybe that's applied for r. t. s c. t. s.|s
mn082|but for the real frame?|qy^d^ng^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|well you just take the|s.%-
mn082|the frame could also be uh whatever i don't know but a few hundred bytes you know that takes a little bit time.|s^df
mn021|let's let's|%--
mn021|no but|s^ar|%-
mn021|yeah but let's say you have one kilobyte.|s^bk|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|one kilobyte is uh eight uh bits.|s^e
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn021|and uh if you are transmitting at let's say uh at one megabit per second this means one microsecond per bit.|fh|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so this only is taking eight milliseconds.|s
mn021|which is not a lot of time if you are travelling let's say at uh one hundred kilometers per second.|s^e
mn082|no|s^ar|%--
mn021|oh per per hour.|s
mn082|no sorry.|s^ar|s^fa
mn082|yeah that's right.|s^na
mn021|sorry.|s^fa
mn082|but first of all it took place r. t. s c. t. s.|s
mn082|and there could be you mentioned if it's still if the medium is still occupied by another one it will be delayed anyway to a randomly time.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|it will be delayed.|s^na
mn021|but you will start from scratch again.|s
mn021|i mean it will be a start with another r. t. s c. t. s.|s^df
mn082|oh.|s^bk
mn082|so|fg
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk^r
mn082|okay.|s^bk^r
mn082|i see.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|but anyway uh well depending on on the network you now the the the this|fg|s.%--
mn021|i will have to translate this.|s^cc^t1
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|it should be something ipsh|s^t1.%--
mn021|so this should be something like|s^t1.%--
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|thirty meters per second.|s^t1
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|oh yeah something like that.|s^aa|s^na
mn021|so in in eight milliseconds well the amount of of space you are travelling is not too much.|s
mn082|it's okay.|s^t3
mn021|for most of of of uh the wireless technologies.|s^e
mn021|maybe not for all of them.|s^e
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|but i'm of course i'm also uh using a conservative value for the transmission speed.|s^df
mn021|now you can get much more speed than speedier interfaces than this one.|s
mn021|but the thing is uh that we are assuming that for a given transmission we can uh consider the network as if it were built of a set of static nodes.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|motion will be important for routing.|s
mn021|but for the media access control level we are considering that motion can be is not is not important.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|yeah what i think maybe some uh cases why i go this way with my node and suddenly i go out of the scope of the transmission area.|s
mn082|because it's really a random movement.|s^df
mn082|then i still hear|s.%--
mn082|this is during the data transmission.|s^e
mn021|yeah but again again what we are adding with this behavior is uh uh a little bit more probably some some uh small part to the uh bit error rate.|s^bk|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|then|%
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|maybe this frame will won't be received properly and should uh have to be uh dropped.|s
mn082|oh yeah.|b
mn021|but anyway|fg
mn021|uh even if nodes are completely static uh some problems will happen in the wireless transmission.|fh|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|we won't have a hundred percent uh perfect uh channel anyway.|s^df
mn082|yep.|b
mn082|right.|b
mn021|so uh if this problem as you show it probably it's it's uh you can you can see that it is not very likely to happen.|fh|s
mn021|because you you you uh have to consider the probability that of happening this|s^df.%-
mn082|nee.|fg
mn082|that's really right.|s^na
mn021|huh.|b
mn082|but what i would like to say is that besides the r. t. s c. t. s behavior you need certain kind of additional mac layer functionality to deal with these packet.|s^cs^ng
mn021|uhhuh huh.|s^bk
mn082|for example with transmission or or whatever.|s^e
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|sure sure.|s^aa
mn082|for whatever control or whatever kind of things you know.|s^e
mn021|in fact in fact you know i i i i i maybe i i i had to to prepare a more detailed uh view.|s
mn021|i i just was trying to do something soft.|s^df
mn021|not to to bore the public.|s^e
mn021|but of course there are a lot of other smart uh things that are built in in these protocols.|s^df
mn082|right.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|like for example an automatic uh acknowledgement.|s^e
mn021|some protocols used uh in the same way as this r. t. s and c. t. s packet some of them use an uh acknowledge from the receiver.|s
mn021|which is also a short packet.|s^e
mn021|so you you are getting some kind of link layer uh acknowledgement scheme.|s
mn021|which can save a lot of data transmissions.|s^e
mn021|because uh usually when you send a a a a frame you will want to some kind of acknowledgement back.|s^df
mn021|so if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new r. t. s and a new c. t. s well this takes longer than just a link layer uh extra packet.|s^df
mn021|that of course uh is also contemplated in this uh packet length length or included in the r. t. s and c. t. s packets.|s
mn021|so uh you know everybody can wait until this uh acknowledgement is also transmitted by the receiver.|fh|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|in fact uh nnn some people proposing this mechanism is is showing a a a big improvement.|s
mn021|and uh there are a lot of other mechanisms also regarding and a time-out mechanism or the time-out algorithm for these retries when you try to send something and you don't succeed uh what what you the amount of time you have to wait until you retry again.|fh|s
mn021|well uh some people is also proposing different things different uh algorithms with different results.|s
mn021|so in fact there are a lot of good|fh|s.%--
mn021|i just was trying to present a you know the main ideas.|s^df
mn021|so i i i you know ask uh you feel free to ask uh whatever you want.|s
mn021|but i i want to insist that it was just an uh a simplified uh version a light version.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn021|well uh you know finally this algorithm uh as i was telling uh what it's doing is to check with the receiver the power level to be used.|fh|s
mn021|and it is very simple to see that some advantages can some advantage can be obtained.|s
mn021|because the difference is uh if you don't have power control you are using all the time the maximum power.|s^df
mn021|if you have power control sometimes you will use less than the maximum power.|s^df
mn021|how often do you use less power than the maximum?|qw
mn021|well this will this will be connected to the motion pattern.|s^df
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|depending how nodes are moving.|s
mn021|well maybe all the time all your neighbors are at the maximum distance|s^rt.%--
mn021|but this probably doesn't look like uh something very very uh very likely.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|because well probably what you will have will be some neighbors that are really close.|s^df
mn082|huh.|b
mn021|others that are a little bit far away.|s
mn021|and finally these neighbors that are in the in the frontier of your of your coverage area.|s
mn021|okay.|b.%
mn082|huh.|b
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|okay this is a question not directly related to these things.|fg|s
mn082|but maybe that's why maybe only a short answer.|s
mn082|uh do you assume that power control will be issue also in the next years?|qy^rt
mn082|in other words um is the um success of having more power within the devices in maybe three year four years five years for batteries and and and and sofort so on.|s^e
mn082|uh will it be succeeded that you have so much power available that this difficult mechanism who is in the wireless network will be uh out of scope?|qy
mn021|huh.|b
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|because if i have a device which uh can i use maybe for twenty four hours.|s^df
mn082|i do not have in principle really the constraint to uh deal with with uh power savings.|s^df^e
mn021|yeah let let me let me answer you uh with a question.|fg|s
mn021|uh if for example your car uh you you have uh an endless uh source of of gas do you think it will it will be a problem the amount of gas your your car is is using?|qy
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|it won't be a problem for your pocket.|s
mn021|for your wallet.|s^e
mn021|but maybe it will be a problem for the environment.|s
mn021|so i think that the answer to your question is in this line.|s
mn021|that uh if you have an endless uh source of power well maybe it's not a problem for the battery uh lasting.|s^bd
mn021|but it is a problem because you are using more area than you should.|s^df^rt
mn021|and therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place at the same time.|s
mn021|and therefore uh the problem is not only connected to to the to the power.|s
mn021|it is also connected to the to the global network throughput.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so|fh
mn021|but again uh you know uh the the|s.%--
mn021|if you ask me what what do you think what will happen in the industry|s.%--
mn021|what i think that will happen is that they will try to get uh huh better hardware than we have now.|s
mn021|because now the problem with transceivers is that a lot of power is uh consumed at the logic of the transceiver.|s^df
mn021|and not uh transmitted to the air.|s^df^e
mn021|it is not power transferred to the air.|s^e
mn021|so the problem now is that uh most of the power uh uh uh a wireless network card is consuming is is is drawn by the by the uh logic control of the card.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|all the all the calculations.|s^e
mn082|that's what i|%-
mn021|all the hardware|s^e.%-
mn082|yeah that was the reason i'm talking about this is uh|fg|s^df.%-
mn021|so i am sure that uh that manufacturers will try to to squeeze until the the the last ampere of of this uh let's say uh wasted power.|s
mn021|because what you cannot avoid is uh|s^df.%--
mn021|to the part of the of the radio frequency power you have to transmit.|s
mn021|i mean this is this cannot be avoided.|s
mn021|but what you can avoid or you can reduce|s.%--
mn021|and probably|s.%--
mn021|because now it is the main factor the main consumption factor is the logic inside.|s^df
mn021|in the same way at as as it happened with with processors for example.|s
mn021|now processors are much more uh power efficient than before.|s
mn021|okay.|s^f
mn082|yeah but anyway that was the reason for my question.|fg|s^bd
mn082|if i save with a lot of difficult mechanism within the air interface and between the base station or access point and the mobile node one percent of the power whereas ninety nine percent is consumed by packet processing.|s
mn082|and and and and uh uh c. p. u or whatever.|s^e
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|uh is it worth to have it?|fh|qy
mn082|if i really with a normal device uh with a battery lifetime of maybe twenty four hours thirty six hours or whatever kind of thing and i think it will be increased.|s^rt
mn082|as the more mobile nodes are in the world the better the battery will be.|s
mn082|so that's was the reason for my question.|s
mn021|yeah pero|s^bk|%-
mn082|yeah yeah yeah.|s^bk
mn021|uh but|%--
mn021|oh sorry.|s^fa
mn021|but even if you if you don't have to to worry about uh your power source you have to worry about your environment.|s
mn021|about not using more resources that you don't own.|s^e
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|that are uh shared about among the community.|s^e
mn082|yeah i got it.|fg|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn040|excuse me.|fg
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn040|if i understood correctly the mechanism uh you should uh look for um the minimum uh coverage range.|s^cs
mn021|yeah.|b
mn040|in order to maximize the throughput of the network.|s^df
mn021|yeah.|b
mn040|so there the the power control uh algorithm should work in order to use at each instant of time the minimum power need to reach|s.%-
mn021|the destination.|s^2
mn040|the neighbor.|s^e
mn040|that because this is the way uh uh more transmissions uh|s^df.%--
mn040|may take take place at the same time.|s^2
mn021|can take place at the same time.|s^rt
mn082|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|s^bk
mn040|so you need the adaptive mechanism to minimize the coverage range.|s^rt
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|that's okay.|s^ba
mn021|and to and to get the maximum network throughput.|s
mn040|that|%-
mn021|that's that's the idea.|s
mn021|however however and|s.%--
mn021|uh it is always some however.|s
mn021|uh by applying this uh greedy mechanism in in|s.%--
mn021|or more than greedy in this case.|s^bsc
mn021|it could be say this stingy mechanism to trying to avoid to use any extra space is also leading to a higher level of interference at the receivers.|s
mn021|so uh|fh
mn021|at the end of the road we have to uh look for some tradeoffs to avoid too much uh interference at the receivers.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|so uh at the end we are using a little bit more power than these mathematically minimum values.|s
mn021|okay.|s^f
mn021|because if not the uh|s^df.%--
mn021|huh|fh
mn021|the frame error rate or the bit error rate uh skyrockets.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|okay.|s^f
mn021|because of the of high interference levels.|s^df
mn021|a lot of simultaneous transmissions also means for each receiver point of view a lot of neighbors or or nodes transmitting at the same time.|s
mn021|and all the transmitters uh with the exception of the transmitter of my transmitter are my intereferers.|s
mn021|and are and all of them are producing less quality reception.|s
mn021|so if they are a lot of them well uh the reception can be can be uh disturbed.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn021|and but um um this is taking longer than i expected.|fh|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|let's let's uh take a a a really a really light uh view at the at the routing in this in this network.|s^t^tc
mn021|which is another important area of of research.|s^rt
mn021|you know in fact there is a a group at the i. t. f uh called manit.|s^rt
mn021|this working group is is devoted to uh try to to present or to agree a common protocol for routing i. p traffic on these uh kind of networks.|s^rt
mn021|on these ad hoc networks.|s^e^rt
mn021|uh and|fh
mn021|at this moment there are i would say a lot of proposals of different protocols uh for uh end to end traffic.|s
mn021|and also for multicast traffic.|s^rt
mn021|on these networks.|s^e
mn021|and uh well some day in the future uh a protocol should be chosen.|s
mn021|but for the moment uh we have several of them on the table.|s
mn021|and uh any protocol has some advantages and some disadvantages.|s
mn021|the basic the basic problem we have to solve in in these uh routing protocols is the fast uh the fast pace at what uh topology changes can happen.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|the problem here is that now uh one node is my neighbor.|s
mn021|and next second it is not.|s^e
mn021|so any route that was going through this neighbor now is is not possible.|s
mn021|and should change.|s^e
mn021|and the problem is that well|s.%--
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|if you let me a personal comment i think that one error on the group is not to agree a set of mobility patterns to to do the the tests.|s
mn021|because here well mobility is making these uh neighborhood relationships to appear or to disappear.|s^df^rt
mn021|so uh it should be interesting if we agree uh a common a common set of motion patterns to perform the tests.|s^rt
mn021|because if not well it's difficult to to perform comparisons uh between one protocol and another.|s^df
mn021|a different one.|s^e
mn021|but anyway now what we have is is two basic approaches to this this problem.|s
mn021|uh mainly what they call the practive protocols.|s
mn021|which are um extensions of of uh um back door and link end state routing protocols.|s
mn021|distance vectors.|s^e
mn021|sorry and and link end state protocols.|s^fa|s
mn021|uh which are usually table driven.|s^rt
mn021|so you have a process trying to to maintain up-to-date a set of routing tables and the nodes.|s^rt
mn021|and uh every routing decision is uh just uh looking up the table.|s^rt
mn021|and sending to the proper neighbor node.|s^rt
mn021|and uh the other the other set of protocols are using a reactive uh approach.|s^rt
mn021|and these protocols are trying to work on demand.|s
mn021|so they are trying to solve on only these routers that are needed.|s
mn021|so when i want to send uh a packet to a a given destination first of all i have to figure out the proper route for this packet.|s
mn021|and then uh i'm using soft routing.|s
mn021|i'm i'm including on the on the uh header of this packet the set of uh nodes that should be forwarding this node to the destination.|s
mn021|uh of course uh these uh two approaches can be can be uh somehow mixed.|s
mn021|and some hybrid proposals are also on the on the paper.|s
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|these proposals are are trying to get the advantages of both uh mechanisms.|s
mn021|uh sometimes making a kind of combination of of them.|s
mn021|uh let's say for example using uh practive approach for the closer set of nodes.|fh|s
mn021|let's say for the neighbors and maybe the next level.|s^rt
mn021|and using a reactive approach.|s
mn021|i mean as our routing approach for nodes that are closer than this practive area.|s^e
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|and uh well|s.%--
mn021|some multicast protocols have been proposed for this scenario too.|s^rt
mn021|and well they have to deal with the same problems that they're uh end to end routing protocols.|s
mn082|huh.|b
mn082|what do you mean by multicast protocols?|qw
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|routing.|s^bu^e
mn021|routing protocols intended for multicast.|s
mn082|okay yeah.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so for for uh for sending one to any.|s^e
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|huh?|qy^d^f^g.%
mn021|uh well the main the main problems that some of the solutions uh are exhibiting is uh the lack of uh scalability.|fh|s
mn021|uh mainly the source routing protocols have a problem when you when you scale from or scale scale badly from tens of nodes to to thousands of nodes.|s
mn021|because well you cannot have uh uh let's say uh an endless uh header length.|s^df
mn021|you have a limited a limited header length.|s^e
mn082|and maybe we will have to explain a little bit for those who are not familiar with source routing.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn082|you can have the destinations you would like to or the in the i. p addresses of the intermediate nodes you still know.|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn082|even if it's not the direct neighbor.|s^e
mn082|but one of uh where you really want that the packet went through put it in the i. p header.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn082|so and|fh
mn082|this one is going then to this guy and so on and so on.|s
mn082|until finally it's reached destination.|s^e
mn030|so there are|s.%-
mn082|and that's what i mean you cannot put it thousand intermediate nodes in for example.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn082|but to put a thousand i. p addresses in the header so that the packet is uh forwarded accordingly to.|s
mn030|so there's more than one i. p address in the header.|s^bu
mn082|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn030|and|fh
mn030|okay i see.|s^bk
mn021|something like this.|s
mn021|so you your packet should look like like this way.|s
mn030|do they have to|qy.%-
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|do they have to be in order?|qy^rt
mn030|so you are looking first for node two and then for node three and so on.|s^e
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|it's uh|%--
mn082|you'll know to remove it's from the header in principle and and so on until it uh reaches the final destination.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so this this uh header well it's it's a problem.|s
mn021|of course there are also some some solutions.|s
mn021|like uh uh employing some kind of of uh hierarchical source routing.|s
mn021|so you don't have to put all the all the route|s.%--
mn082|this one for instance.|s
mn082|that may that the different parts could be one to number four.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn082|maybe two b. or three b..|s:s
mn082|yeah but nevertheless this guy is a is an gateway in the router for for this packet you know.|s
mn082|and they remove itself from the header.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|it must be not the whole path you know.|s
mn021|another problem uh is uh trying to provide some quality of service in these networks.|s
mn021|because well them uh change is is the only thing you know for sure here|s^df.%--
mn021|so uh providing quality of service is also is quite a challenge in in this network.|s
mn021|but again uh there are some proposals.|s
mn082|um miguel are you familiar with these kind of proposals?|qy^rt
mn021|not really.|s^nd
mn021|not really because i don't trust|s^df.%--
mn021|you know|fh
mn021|uh i'm sure that the proposals are okay.|s^ba^df
mn021|but uh i don't i don't think that you cannot you you i don't think you can warranty too much in these networks.|s^df
mn021|so i see this like a you know a a topic i'm not convinced about.|s
mn021|i don't trust you can really provide quality of service.|s^e
mn021|but of course|s.%-
mn082|that depends on the service level you want to be.|s^aap
mn082|definitely not a guarantee level.|s^e
mn082|but maybe something like a control load level or something like that seems to be for me possible.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^am
mn082|right?|qy^d^g
mn021|you know uh if you are curious uh i can i can i can provide you the some of the proposals.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|huh.|b
mn021|which include|s.%-
mn082|yeah we can discuss later off line.|s^bk|s^cs
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|and uh finally the other the other thing which is also under research or under study is uh to have some kind of a power aware routing.|s
mn021|there are some proposals too.|s
mn021|so that way you could|s.%--
mn021|routing function could be connected with uh global or local power consumption.|s
mn021|so for example you could ask to nnn the network to transmit your packet with the lowest uh global uh consumption.|s
mn021|or with your lowest local consumption for example.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn021|i mean would the option for me to to use less power when sending a packet is to send it to the closest neighbor.|s
mn021|okay assuming that i'm i'm also using or having some kind of power control thing.|s^f|s
mn021|so that way transmitting to the closer close to my closer node is uh something that requires less effort than sending to a more distant node.|s
mn021|maybe the closer node is not a good uh it is not in the good direction to the to reach the destination.|s
mn021|but it is for sure the the less expensive uh thing for me.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn021|but probably this uh this is not something really useful.|s^bd
mn021|and that what can be really useful is to reduce the global power consumption in the routing function.|s
mn021|so|%--
mn021|because in this way|s^df.%--
mn021|well maybe one node is is being forced to use more power.|s
mn021|but but if we take a look at the whole thing well we can ask for a a low consumption route.|s
mn021|well the same way|s.%-
mn082|yeah but the|fg|%-
mn021|as we are asking for example when we want uh some packet to be shipped in the real life we can go and say well we will we are happy with this u. p. s ground system.|s:s
mn021|what we want is two day delivery service or twenty four hours service and we are willing to pay more or less for this service.|s
mn082|yeah but it's really happened also in the riot case you know.|s^bk|s
mn082|if i get the wrong route with the r. c. m. p redirects it's in principle then the same.|s^e
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|that's okay.|s^ba
mn082|yeah yeah.|s^bk
mn021|so these are more or less uh some open problems.|s^rt
mn021|and uh well just a quick comment about probably|s.%--
mn021|all of use are now aware of the availability of this uh standard the i. triple e. eight hundred and two point eleven.|s^rt
mn021|uh in fact it is it is powering you know uh the evolution of the of the of networking industry in the wireless area.|s
mn021|and in the beginning the first adaptors uh|s.%--
mn021|oops.|s^fa
mn021|were only one and two megabytes per second.|s^e
mn021|but now we you you can buy for for the same price for even the same price uh the new eleven megabytes per second version.|s
mn021|i've been use it for for a while.|s^rt
mn021|and it can tell you it works pretty well.|s
mn021|and uh the thing is that these devices have two different modes of operation.|fh|s
mn021|one of them and probably the most popular is uh what we call the infrastructure mode.|s
mn021|where you have a set of mobile nodes.|s^rt
mn021|and then you have one or more access points.|s
mn021|these access points are uh in fact providing the uh required connectivity from the mobiles to the network to the wired network.|s
mn021|and from there to the internet usually.|s^e
mn082|yeah in principle the base station.|fg|s
mn021|yeah yeah we can call it a base station.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|yeah.|s^bk.%
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|and uh the other mode of operation which should be appropriate for example for this meeting room example uh doesn't require any any access point.|s^rt
mn021|and in this second case communication happens uh um from one computer to the other at the link layer.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn021|so if i want to connect to uh let's say miguel's uh michael's uh i i will send him a packet.|s^rt
mn021|and he will receive it and that's it.|s
mn021|okay we can build on top of this some uh routing algorithm.|s
mn021|some ad hoc routing algorithm.|s^e
mn021|but this is out of the scope of the of the standard.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|and|fh
mn082|and miguel should i should ask you one question.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|and uh uh in version one and two you you have different technologies.|s
mn082|you know frequency hopping uh two modes and and and also infrared.|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn021|yeah.|b
mn082|does it still apply for for the uh?|qy^rt
mn021|for the|s^2.%--
mn021|no.|s^ar
mn021|eleven b. is only for for uh radio.|s^rt
mn021|and it's only for uh direct sequences spread spectrum.|s
mn082|okay d. s. s.|s^bk|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|but in fact there is an ongoing new version i think it's version a..|s
mn021|but it is not uh commercially available.|s
mn021|which will use uh orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.|s^e
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|and will get probably twenty five megabits per second.|s
mn021|uh but again the will move to five gigahertz.|fh|s
mn021|uh five point five gigahertz.|s^e
mn021|uh gigahertz uh area of a expect uh spectrum.|s^e
mn021|but now uh current devices are split at|s.%--
mn021|you know that the old the old wavelan are nine hundred megahertz version.|s^rt
mn021|and the new ones are the the eleven megabits uh are uh two point four uh i. s. m band.|s
mn082|megahertz.|s^2
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|however uh some old uh wavelans are also but not the older ones the oldest ones are also uh two point four|s.%-
mn021|uh gigahertz.|s^m^na
mn082|uh gigahertz.|s^2
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|in the r. s. m band.|s
mn021|and the good thing is that now especially with the new version all you|s.%--
mn021|you you you are you start to see uh compatible products in the market.|s
mn021|because uh maybe because it's the let's say second version.|s^df
mn021|but also because i think it's the only way for this industry to take off.|s^df^e
mn021|because uh previous versions if you buy let's say wavelan you are tied to wavelan the rest of your life.|s^df
mn021|but now you can you can have interoperable products from several vendors.|s
mn021|which is i think what in the past will power the ethernet uh revolution.|s^e
mn021|you can buy any any compatible product.|s
mn021|and and you know it will work with the other brand.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|and one additional question from myself.|s
mn082|but maybe also short.|s
mn082|because time it running fast.|s^df
mn082|uh i have heard that uh wireless lan and bluetooth will have some problems.|s
mn082|uh that they influence each other.|s^e
mn021|in front?|qy^bu^d
mn082|do you have additional information about this topic?|qy
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|huh.|h
mn021|you know|%--
mn021|in the beginning uh what the|s.%--
mn021|i think that to put things in perspective what we need to know is what bluetooth is and what bluetooth is for.|s
mn021|and uh bluetooth is mainly for cutting this cable.|s
mn021|you know the other day i was joking about that our wireless microphones were not in fact wireless.|s
mn021|because it had this wire.|s
mn021|so the point is that uh bluetooth is mainly a technology for cutting these kind of cables.|s
mn021|you know oh short short distance cables.|s
mn082|yeah that's right.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|uh carrying usually really uh sh nnn|s.%--
mn021|nnn|fh
mn021|slow signals.|s^e
mn021|or let's say boys and something like this.|s^e
mn082|yeah but nevertheless you have the range of ten meters or of one hundred meters.|fg|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|yeah but you know uh in fact|s^aap|s.%--
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|uh the initial version had only the the range of ten meters.|fh|s
mn021|and i guess that somebody at a certain meeting said okay why don't we have a an extended range version.|s:s|qh^cs
mn021|so we could reuse the same technology for other purposes.|s:s^df
mn021|different than the original ones.|s:s^e
mn021|so them uh i have the feeling that this is this is what is uh introducing some confusion in the in the bluetooth.|s
mn021|uh or in the way people is is looking at bluetooth.|s
mn021|because they can say okay hundred meters is is is an acceptable distance.|s^df
mn021|let's say for communicating inside a building inside a a small office.|s
mn021|so uh some people i think is being tempted to think that bluetooth could provide them uh some kind of local connectivity.|s
mn021|but uh for for data for computing uses.|s
mn021|uh however i think that the that the when you have tried uh current uh standard uh working devices you you|s.%--
mn021|working at at eleven megabits per second you cannot you cannot switch to another thing to another slower thing.|s
mn021|but uh even when they are using the same the same uh um area of a a spectrum.|s
mn021|because bluetooth is also intended to work in two point four uh gigabits.|s^df
mn082|yeah.|b
mn021|uh the technologies are different.|s
mn021|you know uh bluetooth uh is using a frequency hopping system.|s
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|huh|fh
mn021|both uh dialing sequence and frequency hopping spread the spectrum techniques are also intended to provide uh interference uh less uh data transmission.|s
mn021|so the idea is that these two techniques are intended not to interfere with any other thing.|s
mn021|so even when i haven't tried and i cannot tell you for sure i think that the only problem one network will encounter uh in the presence of the other is a little bit of more noise.|s
mn021|and this will produce a little bit less throughput.|s^bd
mn021|but nothing more.|s^df
mn021|i don't expect any any more problem.|s
mn021|even the the the own bluetooth specification is also|s.%--
mn021|uh huh|fh
mn021|assuming that another bluetooth or several bluetooth networks will be could be in the same area of space|s.%--
mn021|and they are using the same hopping technology frequency hopping technology.|s
mn021|but again this technology is uh trying to avoid the other networks by choosing different hopping patterns.|s
mn021|so uh if several bluetooth networks can can uh coexist without a problem i don't see any problem will will happen if if we want to to make coexist one uh bluetooth with another wireless uh local area network technology.|s
mn082|well that's a good news okay?|s^ba|qy^d^f
mn021|yeah i think so.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|but anyway um based on your uh uh initial scenario i believe because bluetooth is on one chip|s.%--
mn021|yeah.|b
mn082|like you have now your u. c. b buss or whatever connectivity you will have your bluetooth connectivity.|s
mn021|five bucks.|s
mn082|and that means your mouse and and and|s.%-
mn021|five bucks chip.|s^e
mn082|yeah and and and whatever kind of of uh things connected to your laptop and also your microphone and whatever you will will have is bluetooth-based.|s^bk^rt|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|yeah or will be bluetooth-based.|s^f|s^bsc
mn021|will be.|s^bc
mn082|yeah and this is this is uh within maybe an uh wireless lan.|s^bk|s
mn021|will be.|s^r
mn082|so despite the fact that they are considered for different scenarios they are still|s.%-
mn021|in fact in fact bluetooth is also designed.|s
mn082|within one one area.|s^e
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|to be compatible with existing digital european cordless telephones.|s^e
mn021|so hopefully we will be able to use some of our old devices or maybe our our cordless phone base station at home with a computer.|s
mn021|so i think some really nice applications will will appear.|s
mn082|okay we'll when i i will have some problems in the future with my wireless lan and bluetooth connectivity.|s^bk|s^j
mn082|i will come to you.|s^cc^j
mn082|you will solve it okay?|s^j|qy^d^f^g
mn021|i'll try to.|s^na
mn082|okay please go on.|s^bk|s^co^tc
mn021|so let me let me just uh finish you know.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|uh well this is something i more or less i told you.|s
mn021|and uh you know the point or or or|fh|s.%--
mn021|what the the spark of of my of my work here or at least of what i was proposing to work here is the fact that these two uh two modes of operation i was telling you here that you have to choose at the driver level if your network adaptor is working in an access point based environment or in ad in an ad hoc environment i see this as a as a limitation.|s
mn021|because i think that uh when you have to choose among two options well huh maybe you are saying no to some of the benefits the other option different than the one you are choosing could provide you.|s^df
mn021|and i envision an an an an escenario where uh|s.%--
mn021|oops.|s^fa
mn021|well yeah.|s^bk
mn021|let's go.|s^co^t1
mn021|where we can have a kind of uh dual mode uh wireless network adaptor.|s
mn021|so if we are not able to reach any access point but we are able to reach another network node well maybe this network node could do me the favor to reach or to forward my packets to the access point.|s
mn021|so the main idea the driving force here is to uh try to obtain uh let's say hybrid mode.|s
mn021|which allows an adaptor to work either in the access point or in the uh in the ad hoc mode in a seamless way.|s
mn021|and to include in every single node driver|s.%--
mn021|this forwarding or helper uh forwarding mechanism that will allow to extend the wireless coverage without a need of buying a lot of access points.|s
mn021|and putting even an access point inside the restroom okay?|s^e|qy^d^f^g
mn021|of course this idea huh can sound can sound a little bit not very appealing for the manufacturers.|s
mn021|at least for the manufacturers of access point.|s^e
mn021|because well they probably are very happy of selling a lot of them.|s^df
mn082|but maybe for cars.|s^cs
mn082|yeah if your car is the infrastructure for instance.|s^e
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|so this is the i think this is near the end this is the last.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|one possible extension of the same idea and something uh i've been thinking for awhile is the idea that well why can't do we extend this same concept to cell array systems?|qh
mn021|why can't we for example think about some huh new mechanisms that users could get uh connectivity by means of other users and no directly to the base station?|qh
mn021|or when we have several technologies uh in overlapped in a certain area why can't we use the closest and the cheapest maybe technology?|qh
mn021|or maybe the less power consumption technology without the user to worry about if he is now using this or the other technology.|s^e
mn021|and on the other hand what are the billing implications of this behavior?|qh
mn021|because it is clear that well when i'm only uh talking to the to the base station of my provider well billing is more or less straightforward.|s^df
mn021|but what happens if i'm working uh let's say uh across a mall and at a given moment i'm using the small base station of a cordless phone that is inside the shop i'm at the window of?|qh
mn021|well in this case i'm using a resource which is not owned by my provider.|s
mn021|i'm using a let's say a private property.|s^rt
mn021|maybe i have to pay to this private property.|s
mn021|or maybe my carrier will have to pay or to refund some money to this guy.|s
mn021|you know this something uh i'm putting on the table.|s^df
mn021|i'm not sure about uh if this can be really of interest or not.|s^bd
mn021|but it's an idea.|s
mn021|and i'll be happy to discuss it with you.|s
mn021|and i uh i think my presentation is over.|s^t^tc
mn021|so|fh
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|many thanks miguel.|s^ft
mn082|are there any questions?|qo^rt
mn021|oh you are welcome.|s^fw
mn082|maybe we have also the time to discuss with miguel off line the things if there is some uh question concerning uh his talk or maybe other questions.|s^cs
mn082|maybe one last question from my side.|s
mn082|because i bring it up uh concerning the proposal some kind of active routing mechanism.|s^df
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|it's going in a quite different direction as as as as the traditional things discussed in the i. t. f.|s
mn082|and i currently do not have any idea whether active routing is really a topic uh within the i. t. f.|s
mn082|do you have certain kind of experience or do you know certain activities uh in that area?|qr
mn021|nnn no to both to both questions.|h|s^nd
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|i don't have previous experience.|s^rt
mn021|i don't uh know if uh where it will it would fix.|s
mn021|however uh you know i'm just doing this presentation.|s
mn021|uh somehow a review of my previous work.|fh|s
mn082|i know yeah.|s|s^bk
mn021|so uh this uh doesn't mean that|s.%--
mn021|i'm i'm probably getting involved a little bit more in this active routing thing.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|so uh i i maybe i will be able to hopefully i will be able to to give you a better answer in the future.|fh|s
mn082|oh okay.|s^bk
mn082|one more time many thanks miguel.|s^ft
mn082|so|fg
mn021|oh thanks michael for your computer.|s^ft
mn035|no problem.|s^fw
mn082|so i will deploy a little bit information here from the uh project proposal.|s
mn021|should i power off it?|qy^t3
mn035|um just log out.|s^co^t3
mn021|okay.|s^bk^t3
mn035|uh no.|fg|s^ar^t3
mn035|log out.|s^co^t3
mn021|oh okay sorry sorry.|s^bk^t3|s^fa^t3
mn082|so i have only|s.%--
mn082|four.|s
mn021|oh.|s^bk
mn082|jordi is only a short period of time here.|s
mn021|which is which is proper|s.%-
mn082|so he will get the colored one.|s
mn021|michael.|s
mn040|uh thank you thank you very much.|s^ft
mn035|okay.|s^bk
mn021|michael.|s^r
mn082|and take a look to|s^cs.%--
mn021|which is the proper answer.|s^ba
mn082|uh|fh
mn035|that's the proper answer.|s^na
mn021|this one?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn035|yeah.|b.%
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|thank you.|s^ft
mn082|kill the computer.|s
mn082|uh so i started uh for for advertising the project proposal here to provide a few slides.|h|s^tc
mn082|i think first of all wilbert is not here.|s
mn082|second um the um link here was uh enabling u. m. t. s services and application.|s
mn082|uh i assume was not read yesterday night.|s
mn082|so i suggest we go roughly to the slides here.|s^cs
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|the the problem is that in principle we have different scopes.|s
mn082|and motivation of the project proposal from my point of view is that we will have the um wireless access networks for the next generation will be more flexible.|s
mn082|there's a for uh current uh uh uh for for fast changes within this network.|s
mn082|and that means if you go to slide number three that we have um the possibility to to um having normal features in the mobile access network.|s
mn082|and|fh
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|and um also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain that it is possible to to uh use novel things.|s
mn082|and and and new protocols and new technologies within this network.|s
mn082|on the other hand in the internet backbone uh we it is impossible.|s
mn082|and we see it on several examples.|s
mn082|like this m. p. l. s.|s^e
mn082|there's quality of service support and multicast.|s
mn082|and all this kind of thing.|s^e
mn082|that based on the success of the internet backbone it's become uh very unflexible to uh for the provision of these things.|s
mn082|so if we are going to offer building blocks and provide novel solutions for the next generation of wireless access networks taking into account without modifying the end to end scope then i think it's really beneficial work.|s
mn082|also for the use of interactive multimedia application.|s^e
mn082|so as it is described in the uh project proposal.|s
mn082|um the point is that um to start with um a bigger cluster of uh of potential partners to do this really really really big work.|s
mn082|seems not to be feasible in the next time.|s^e
mn082|because if you have settled everything and discussed everything and and and and uh without any money in the background and a lot of money in the background|s^df.%--
mn082|that is not uh feasible from my point of view.|s
mn082|nevertheless i discussed with a lot of partners these things.|s^df
mn082|and today uh michael and me we were on the u. c. b to discuss with a guy who is a professor who is probably interested in the application stuff.|s
mn082|they are going in that direction.|s
mn082|they have a small project funded by n. s. a.|s
mn082|n. s. f.|s^bsc
mn082|um for this intelligent classroom is a little bit exaggerated i believe.|s^e
mn082|but going in that direction.|s
mn082|so there are a lot of interest.|s
mn082|but without really hard money in the background it is very hard to come to the initial steps.|s
mn082|and uh juan peire one of the uh members of this n. s. a group has uh identified a certain kind of start money i would like to say.|s
mn082|so maybe if you start with a small cluster of um the constraints of this funding.|s^cs
mn082|and that means uh six universities and and institutions.|s
mn082|uh three in u. s. a and three in europe.|s^e
mn082|and of course they are uh including the n. s. a group.|s
mn082|and maybe that seems to be very reasonably for me.|s
mn082|but then we have to align the project proposal in that sense.|s^cs
mn082|because then we cannot do do anything as it is described in the in the bigger scope.|s^df
mn082|so the point is um to reduce the overall picture which i described in a few words to the fact that we have really some work packages where we can focus on it.|s
mn082|still fitting into the big picture.|s^e
mn082|yeah.|s^f
mn082|and so that will be the task of the next weeks.|s
mn082|and uh|fh
mn082|i hope that everybody is doing his homework concerning for instance.|s
mn082|uh alternative to the intelligent classroom maybe that we can start here only with the n. s. a group.|s^cs
mn082|within this big picture.|s^e
mn082|um with some work.|s^e
mn082|that we put the pieces together.|s^e
mn082|because i believe many are very flexible here.|s^df
mn082|accounting also the future coming uh joining people of the n. s. a group to do some work here.|s
mn082|and if we are starting with a very very very small cluster with a common activity have maybe some starting funding for bigger uh radius of the of the the the uh project proposal with the mind that maybe at the final stage it will becoming a european proposal with this uh the the whole funding.|s
mn082|that's uh my point and my picture i have in mind.|s
mn082|and i will go definitely back to germany the tenth of december.|s^rt
mn082|that is fixed now.|s
mn082|and i hope we can use these remaining weeks to have really progress in uh for the proposal in that sense what i mentioned before.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|because then i will make the advertising that is still worth to stay here.|s^df
mn082|and i hope then siemens will say okay for me to stay longer here.|s:s
mn082|and then i will come back maybe in the mid of end of january.|s
mn082|so that's uh it's a comment to the proposal.|s
mn082|so i think everybody should consider carefully based on this statement i made uh next steps.|s^cs
mn082|and of course everybody has little bit other work to do.|s^bd
mn082|but it should be should be always an ongoing process until i will leave until the tenth of december.|s^df
mn030|you mentioned um six partners of this um work.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn030|so you know already what partners are included.|s^bu
mn030|okay i didn't have a look at uh slides.|s^bk|s^df
mn082|um|h
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|i will distribute all the things electronically.|s
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn082|to all the|s^e.%--
mn082|okay take a look to slide of number two.|s^bk|s^cs^rt
mn030|just i'm just curious.|s^df
mn082|yeah.|s^bk^rt
mn082|you see uh uh university of mannheim.|s
mn082|university|s.%--
mn082|also these are the official ones.|s
mn030|yeah sure.|s^bk
mn082|you see that in the icsi u. s on the u. s. a side i believe that the home companies and universities are still contributing.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn030|yeah yeah.|s^bk
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|but these are then the official ones.|s
mn082|and i would like to have them|s.%-
mn030|and all of them had agreed?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn030|or|qrr.%--
mn082|they say they are very interested in it.|s^na
mn030|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|uh a few words the university of mannheim is at location where joerg widmer is uh working on it.|s
mn082|and i got the statement|s.%--
mn082|uh they are very interested in that.|s
mn082|they did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom.|s
mn082|but nevertheless they did a lot in networking stuff.|s
mn082|and university of uppsala sweden.|s
mn082|that's the reason i invited uh christian tschudin the professor who did ten years work in in active routing.|s
mn082|and uh okay the universidad nacional de|fh|s.%--
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|spanish.|s^df
mn082|maybe we have a better expert to pronounce it.|s
mn021|universidad nacional de educacion a distancia.|s
mn082|uned.|s^bk^m
mn082|i always said uned.|s
mn082|in spain.|s^e
mn082|uh this is this university of juan peire.|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn082|and he is also the one who had recognized uh|s.%-
mn040|who is?|qw^rt
mn082|one|s.%--
mn082|pair.|s^r
mn082|pair.|s^r
mn040|perez.|s
mn082|not parez peire.|s^nd|s
mn082|p. e. i. r. e.|s^e
mn035|paez.|s
mn021|paez paez.|s
mn035|paez.|s^r
mn040|uh peire.|s^bk|s
mn082|no no no.|s^ar
mn021|paez.|s
mn082|not not paez.|s^nd
mn082|not|%--
mn082|peire.|s
mn082|p.   e.   i.   r.   e.  .|s
mn082|you never heard from him?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn040|no.|s^ar
mn040|i don't know.|s^no
mn082|you can i you can mail him later on the|s^cs.%--
mn040|i don't know who he is.|s^no
mn040|okay.|s^bk
mn082|then of course the whole n. s. a group.|s
mn082|and also of the coordinator of all the things.|s
mn082|then georgia tech i have good relationship to uh the long lasting uh cooperation with georgia tech.|s
mn082|and they did a lot in this area also related to networking stuff as well as to the intelligent classroom stuff and the u. c. b.|s
mn082|we still focusing on maybe we can have uh more professors involved.|s^df
mn082|which are working also on the networking stuff as well as on the application stuff.|s^df
mn082|so that the u. c. b is clustered as one uh partner.|s
mn082|but nevertheless with different departments.|s^e
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|so|fh
mn082|but take a look to the slides i will uh deploy it um uh electronically.|s
mn021|where your slides are available?|qw
mn082|sorry?|qw^br^rt
mn021|where the slides are available?|qw^r
mn082|i will send it electronically.|s
mn021|when?|qw
mn082|after the meeting.|s
mn021|uh.|s^bk
mn021|you will send it sorry.|s
mn082|i will.|s^cc
mn082|future.|s
mn021|sorry.|s^fa
mn082|and maybe you take a look to the uh last two slides.|s^cs
mn082|um um|fh
mn082|maybe the g. p. r. s picture is still uh available.|s
mn082|so you have in principle here now the mapping of the different areas um within g. p. s.|s
mn082|and in principle the same applies for u. m. t. s.|s
mn082|there is no so much different.|s
mn082|um you always have the s. g. s. n and u. m. t. s.|fh|s
mn082|they are called three g. s. g. s. n..|s
mn082|and you have the protocol stack.|s
mn082|um in on the slide number five to see what uh is going on.|s
mn082|and you see the difference.|s^e
mn082|the amazing thing is that you have i. p over i. p.|s
mn082|as you take a look to the the uh g. g. s. n you have two i. p. layer functionality and and all those things.|s
mn082|and you have the g. p. s tunnel uh protocol g. t. p between the g.   and the s.   and the g. t. s. n.|s
mn082|and and so on.|s^e
mn082|so uh i believe they are very very difficult protocols stuck between the uh between the um um involved nodes.|s
mn082|and making it necessary in principle to deal with our four building blocks in um yeah i believe in a difficult way.|s
mn082|if uh we have in mind quality of service routing and and uh uh mobility aspects and and all this kinds of things for i. p layer functionality.|s
mn082|so that's in principle uh an overview of the protocol stack.|s
mn082|and the involved nodes.|s^e
mn082|and i will provide more and more information.|s
mn082|but um uh i have to also figure out everything from the scratch.|s
mn082|i am not a total expert for for the future wireless networks.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk^rt
mn082|then i would like to thanks everybody.|s^ft
mn082|and if there's no additional question comment or or other remarks i would like to start with reading uh these numbers.|s
mn021|okay we have|s^bk|%-
mn082|okay please the next one.|z
mn082|okay thank you.|s^bk|s^ft
mn082|now please let don't switch off power.|s^cs
mn082|i have to call adam.|s
mn082|so|fh
mn082|so i suggest now we will have in a few minutes we will have the coffee break tea cake whatever will will be offered.|s
mn082|and then we will have a we can have a discussion.|s
mn082|okay.|z
mn082|we can start?|z
mn082|okay.|z
mn082|thank you adam.|z
mn082|i will call you then when we are ready.|z
mn082|i believe maybe one hour in that sense.|z
mn082|okay.|fg
mn082|welcome to our next meeting.|s^rt
mn082|um i have couple of points we should discussed.|fh|s
mn082|one is related to the proposal.|s^rt
mn082|michael please can you close the door?|qy^co
mn035|yep.|s^aa
mn082|thank you.|s^ft
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|furthermore as most of you know i will leave in tenth of december.|s^rt
mn082|i think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime.|s^rt^t
mn082|because i get i would like to say different signals from siemens.|s^rt
mn082|i believe in the meantime it's a higher probability that i will return.|s
mn082|but based on the uh procedure to get a j. one visa and the i. p six six it will be i would like to say earliest stage will be end of january.|s^df^rt
mn082|so that means we have to get over six weeks.|s
mn082|and|fh
mn082|then furthermore i would like to know the status of everybody.|s
mn082|i know for sure okay um miguel you will have your plans for this uh ongoing process uh concerning your work.|s
mn082|okay from you it's definitely clear in principle.|s
mn082|okay for michael what are your current plans?|qw^rt
mn082|and dietmar maybe you then also.|s
mn082|what we have discussed in principle concerning the ongoing process with u.   u. s. a. i. a and also this uh your current work.|s^rt
mn082|and from my point it seems to be clear that i will go back.|s^rt
mn082|definitely at tenth of december.|s
mn082|and as i mentioned before probably will be more than fifty percent i would like to say that i will be come back to get the freedom to launch here the project in the sense in whatever kind of form and get in principle paid by another project within siemens.|s
mn082|so the point is how long i will stay.|fh|s
mn082|i believe a couple of months definitely.|s
mn082|and based on the success i think that's always an ongoing process to go back to uh to germany for a couple of weeks.|s
mn082|and then come here and and go on with with this work.|s
mn082|and|fh
mn082|so that is my current opinion concerning how siemens deal with with my uh ongoing effort.|s
mn082|and furthermore i would like to first of all thanks to uh dietmar.|s^ft
mn082|because he started to use a testbed.|s^df
mn030|oh.|s^bk
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|in principle in his spare time.|s^rt
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|yeah.|b
mn082|uh i will|s.%--
mn082|so so the first uh uh box this morning.|s
mn082|i will set up definitely in my spare time in the evenings and the weekends the second box.|s^cc
mn082|and i'm looking for two other volunteers who are setting the third and the fourth box.|s
mn021|but what are the box?|qw
mn082|a box is a p. c.|s
mn030|p. c.'s.|s
mn030|p. c.'s.|s^r
mn021|but what|qw.%-
mn082|equipped with with we should equipped it with with linux.|s^cs
mn082|or maybe too with free b. s. d.|s^cs^rt
mn030|well the first|s.%-
mn082|i doubt i don't know.|s^no
mn030|stop.|s^co
mn082|and we'll|%-
mn030|the first thing the most uh complicated is to fit them with the removal removable um hard disk.|s
mn082|and now we have an expert.|s^j
mn030|but it's|%-
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|so the first computer i had to|s.%--
mn030|um|fh
mn030|the|fh
mn030|oh.|s^bk
mn030|what's the right word?|qw^rt
mn030|i had to put everything out.|s
mn030|to to put the removable hard disk in.|s^e
mn082|yeah to|s.%-
mn082|so that you can pull uh the plug in the removable hard disk to the i. d bus.|s
mn030|and and it's|s.%-
mn021|okay.|b
mn030|yeah it's|s^bk|%-
mn082|and and okay maybe it's a little bit|s.%-
mn030|but but it's not not um very uh difficult or something like that.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn030|so you just have to|s.%-
mn082|and|fh
mn082|why you are laughing?|qw
mn082|i|%--
mn082|i don't know.|s^no
mn082|i i i didn't see him.|s
mn082|so i don't know what he did.|s^no
mn082|i know in the meantime it's running.|s
mn030|uh!|s^fe
mn082|and i will definitely set up the next one.|s^cc
mn030|so wilbert will set up the second computer.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|though my idea maybe you uh can equip it with|s.%--
mn082|i don't know what your time whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with free b. s. d for instance.|s^no
mn021|you know i i can i can build uh any computer uh you installing whatever it's needed.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|i mean i will enjoy doing it.|s^df
mn082|do you find the time?|qy^rt
mn021|so|fh
mn021|that's okay for me.|s
mn081|huh.|b
mn082|maybe also to uh support your|s.%-
mn081|no promises.|s
mn082|no promises?|qy^bu^d^m
mn081|no.|s^aa
mn082|and even maybe to to uh put your i. g. m. p stuff on it.|s
mn082|uh|fh
mn081|no promises.|s
mn082|no promises.|s^bk^m
mn081|no.|s^aa
mn082|uh he's very hard to sell.|s^ba
mn030|so it's about one hour to put this uh hard disk in.|s
mn030|and a further hour to uh well two or three hours to install the operating systems.|s
mn082|nee because then the network is still running then.|s
mn082|could we wait until the network is running?|qy^rt
mn082|because currently it's not possible uh based on certain fire wall constraints.|s^df
mn030|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|at the moment.|s^aap
mn082|i believe david is uh currently working on that to set up the fire wall.|s^df
mn082|and he's not an expert for that.|s^df
mn082|and when i get the signal i will ask one more time.|s^cc
mn082|nah but nevertheless thanks to dietmar that he.|s^ft
mn081|did the networks have internet connectivity?|qy^rt
mn082|yes.|s^aa
mn082|we have uh for for secure socket.|s^df
mn082|and uh for web access the fire wall is open.|s^df
mn082|that's all.|s
mn082|and but currently it's not working right?|s|qy^d^g^rt
mn030|right.|s^aa
mn030|um on friday when i installed um uh linux the first time i got access to the local network here um but not to any machines outside of uh i. c. s. i.|fh|s
mn030|and till monday there's no access at all to any machines.|s
mn030|also not to inside machines.|s^e
mn082|but then|s.%--
mn082|uh|fh
mn030|so i think it's related to the work um they've done on sunday here.|s
mn030|and i sent|s.%-
mn081|but normally you should have access to all the internet to outside.|s
mn082|yes.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|you have internet outside access.|s^na
mn081|full.|s^e
mn082|but no telnet and not r. login or whatever kind of things you know.|s
mn081|a restricted in.|s
mn081|not.|s^bk
mn081|huh?|qy^bh
mn081|not a no f. t. p.|s
mn082|yeah f. t. p yes.|s^nd
mn082|but no telnet.|s
mn081|huh.|s^bk
mn082|uh because you can|s.%--
mn082|the the the point is that we will use it as it is uh described several times that we will use it as a local network in principle.|s
mn082|but it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of uh media transportation to put some stuff you need from your p. c or your l. s to this uh uh uh to this testbed.|s
mn082|you know.|fh
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|so|fh
mn082|you download it if that must be possible from the network.|s
mn082|but normally it should be used as um uh for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than uh one box which you have on your desktop.|s
mn082|because that is the primary uh uh reason for this testbed.|s^df
mn082|so definitely you have to have web access to download the necessary files.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b.%
mn082|so and then furthermore one more thanks to claudia.|s^ft^rt
mn082|he did a lot of work.|s^df
fn083|right.|b
mn082|and i could only pass her some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages.|s^df
fn083|uh the messages.|s^bk
fn083|oh.|s^bk
mn082|and now we are in principle in the state we have to do it with a project area.|s^rt
mn082|but they're also some contributions from you guys requested.|s
mn082|um|fh
mn082|and the alumni page in principle we have to|s.%--
mn082|you know but it's primarily my job i believe uh to set up so that it is uh adjusted really to the people who are worth to be alumnis.|s
mn082|alumnis.|s
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|is it alumni alumni?|qr^bu^rt
mn082|i'm|%-
fn083|alumni.|s
mn082|alumni.|s^bk^m
mn082|i'm not sure how to pronounce this word.|s^df
mn035|aber das wird jetzt geaendert.|s
mn082|huh?|qw^rt
mn035|das wird geaendert.|s
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|but um|fh
mn082|i think everybody should take a look to the web pages and inform claudia if something uh has to be improved or if there's some comments.|s^co
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|or|fh
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|he's laughing all the time.|s^j
mn082|why?|qw
mn082|uh because it is you know that's very important.|s^df
mn082|maybe not for us.|s^am^df
mn082|but maybe for our successors.|s^am^df
mn082|and maybe somebody will come back once a day or send some students or some colleagues or whatever.|s^am^df
mn082|so my point of view i will i will documented everything when i will leave here in the sense that potential successor as a group leader can hook in with these things and that these web pages will be updated every time when it is necessary.|s^cc
mn082|we tried to do it so that it must be at least updated only when really major changes happen.|s^df
mn082|so that means somebody's leaving the group.|s^e
mn082|uh somebody is joining the group.|s^e
mn082|a new project is started.|s^e
mn082|but uh the effort should be minimized as possible.|fh|s^cs
mn082|and so please take a look to the web pages.|fh|s^co^rt
mn082|and|fh
mn082|i have announced in the project area the major headlines.|s
mn082|and especially wilbert maybe you can write something about yours?|qy^co^d^rt
mn082|i call it i believe multicast and then development deployment uh for for source specific|s.%--
mn082|maybe a few lines.|s^cs
mn082|maybe a picture.|s^cs
mn082|and something like that should be added to u. s. a. i. a.|s^co
mn082|okay that's my stuff.|s^bk|s
mn082|and|fh
mn082|um|fh
mn082|then the next point is then this active routing stuff.|s^rt^tc
mn082|um|fh
mn082|i would like to discuss it before.|s
mn082|but you were busy.|s^df
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|and so.|fh
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|um|fh
mn082|i believe it must be adjusted to the current activities a little bit more.|s^cs
mn021|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|i i think it doesn't|s.%--
mn082|it is not worth to discuss it now.|s
mn082|because nobody raised it before.|s^df
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|i think so.|s^na
mn082|and uh so let us have a bilateral discussion afterwards.|fh|s^co
mn082|i would what i would like to have is that um your contributions is related to certain kind of things happened here.|s^cs
mn082|and that means really to the project proposal itself and also maybe to the u. s. a. i. a architecture.|s
mn082|in that sense that at certain stages because it's a general architecture certain stages maybe to future mobile core networks that it is related to these kind of things.|s
mn082|um having uh i what i have in mind is that things should not be started from the end system.|fh|s^co
mn082|that's my principle concern.|s
mn082|because that will never be happen from my point of view.|s
mn082|it should be started as the edge device.|s^co
mn082|so that it certain kind of mechanism whatever is enabled between the ingress edge device and the outgress edge device.|s
mn082|because it will be at the certain stage i. p based in the future generation telecommunication networks before its goal.|s^df
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn021|that's okay.|s^aa
mn082|fuel it to the over the internet.|s
mn082|and between these both boxes i can assume uh because the mobility happens there as a normal natural thing.|s
mn082|and the forwarding process and the routing process should be no more separated from my point of view.|s
mn082|and to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism that the packets can be used to set up the routes because they have all the information.|s
mn082|they know where they have to go because i. p addresses are still there and within the packet.|s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|i mean how can this use uh within this area and how this area is then aligned to the more traditional routing within the internet backbone itself?|qw
mn082|that's my question.|s
mn082|and i think that is good a research area.|s^ba
mn082|then i think there's a lot of|s.%--
mn082|i'm not a expert at all for this.|s^df
mn082|but i i i believe there's a lot of potential for that.|s^ba
mn082|and we should discuss it maybe bilateral afterwards.|s^cs
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|so one more time everybody should take a look to the web pages.|s^bs^co
mn082|and from claudia at the general remarks.|s^bs^co
mn082|and should write based on the uh headlines in the project proposal the um things what still happened the things what they have still in mind.|s^bs^co
mn082|uh so that we can update these last you know present the last major part of the web pages.|fh|s^df
mn030|the pages are already on the web?|qy^d^rt
mn021|okay.|s^bk
fn083|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yes.|s^aa
mn030|yeah.|b
fn083|it is.|s^na
mn082|you can now access it normally with maybe w. w. w i. c. s. i berkeley edu.|s^df
fn083|so there are some gaps.|s
mn030|okay.|b
mn030|huh.|s^bk
mn082|and|fh
mn082|so|fh
mn030|okay.|s^bk
fn083|yeah so there are some gaps left.|s^r
fn083|and|fh
fn083|i don't know.|fh
fn083|you maybe you can also read through the all the text which is on the web pages.|s^cs
fn083|because i'd like to change the text a bit.|s^df
fn083|because sometimes it's too long.|s^df
fn083|sometimes it's too short.|s^df
fn083|maybe the english is not that good.|s^df
fn083|so|fh
fn083|um|fh
fn083|but anyways.|fg
fn083|so i tried to do this today.|s
fn083|and if you could do it afterwards it would be really nice.|s^cs
fn083|because i'm quite sure that i can't find every like orthographic mistake in it or something.|s^df
mn021|uh there there there are couple of comments i i have about the web pages.|s
fn083|good.|s^ba
mn021|one is is the uh i think it's joe's uh graphic i think it should be better.|s
fn083|yeah yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
fn083|the graphics are too bad.|s^ba^na
mn021|maybe you are working at it.|s
fn083|i know.|s^na
mn082|you are definitely right.|s^na
mn082|it was in a good shape but it uh then we disturbed.|s^df
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|and then maybe the the i. c. s. i logo could be could be could be|s^cs.%--
fn083|i can't change something with a logo.|s^ng
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|no.|s^ar
mn021|it is just|s.%--
mn021|uh|fh
mn021|maybe we can we can uh translate the white color into transparent color.|s^cs
mn021|so it will get more natural.|s^df
fn083|yeah.|s^aa
fn083|okay.|s^aa
fn083|good.|s^ba
fn083|yeah i|s^bk|%--
mn021|it's just a suggestion.|s^df
fn083|another thing is i'd want to get a link on the logo so that you can come from the logo to the icsi web home page back.|s^cs
mn021|to the home page.|s^2
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|that's that's okay.|s^na
fn083|so|fh
fn083|that's these are some things i have to do.|s
fn083|yeah.|fh
fn083|and if you have something which i should put on the web page for you|s.%--
fn083|so|fh
fn083|yeah some pictures will be nice.|s^bk|s^ba^cs
fn083|a few sentences will be nice.|s^ba^cs
fn083|and|fh
fn083|yeah it depends on how much time you have.|s^bk|s^df
fn083|and then the page for about|s.%--
fn083|so some information for people who are new comers or|s.%--
fn083|i don't know a good word for it.|s^no
fn083|should we use uh new comers?|qy^rt
fn083|or|qrr.%--
fn083|so with somebody who is new arriving here or wants to to uh send an application.|s
mn081|newbies.|s^cs
fn083|huh?|qw^br^rt
mn081|newbies.|s^r
fn083|newbies?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
fn083|yeah okay.|s^aa
fn083|so there i have to add some information.|s
fn083|i don't know i i tried to set up everything by today for this page.|s
fn083|because i've started with this.|s^df
fn083|um if you have any kind of ideas what was important for you then just let|fh|s^cs.%--
fn083|because i have some points like um i don't know yeah like pacific bell.|s
fn083|like uh long-distance carriers.|s^e
fn083|then like uh cars and car insurances.|s^e
fn083|health insurances.|s^e
fn083|so health insurance is something i can only say for german people.|s^df
mn021|uhhuh huh.|s^bk
fn083|so maybe|s.%--
fn083|i don't know if this is different in spain.|s^no
fn083|that would be fine too to have some information or in nnn holland.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
fn083|i don't know.|s^no
mn021|i will take a look and i will tell you something.|s^cc
fn083|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|uhhuh.|b
fn083|so how maybe how you did it or whatsoever.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|i will send you some because i have something in mind.|s^cc
fn083|so|fh
fn083|yeah.|s^bk
fn083|then what else did i have?|qw
fn083|then|fh
fn083|another point's like uh what about the bank.|s^tc
fn083|uh so transferring your money from europe over here what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something?|qw
fn083|um|fh
fn083|another point.|s
fn083|yeah and then there's there's another point like going out in berkeley or what to do in berkeley or in the neighborhood.|s
mn081|this a lot of this stuff is not networking group n. s. a uh restricted.|s
fn083|no.|s^aa
fn083|i know.|s^na
mn082|yeah but nobody do that you know.|s
fn083|i know.|s^na
fn083|but there's nothing like this on the on the icsi page as far as i know.|s^df
mn082|so|fh
mn082|that's the point.|s
mn082|we discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago.|s
mn082|uh the point is normally it is an i. c. s. i task anyway.|s
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|but|fh
mn081|yeah but at least then it should be huh i think be uh i. c. s. i part and not network restricted.|s^bk|s^cs
mn082|right.|b
mn021|well they have uh a a white booklet you know probably|s.%-
mn082|yeah that is from nineteen ninety one or nineteen ninety two you know.|s^bk|s
fn083|yeah but it's not in the|s^bk|s^ng.%-
fn083|this is not on the web.|s
mn082|and this is not on the web.|s^bk^m
mn021|no.|s^aa
mn021|no no.|s^aa^r
mn082|and the the the|%--
mn021|i i just i|%-
mn082|people|%--
mn082|normally that's was my my uh|s.%--
mn021|in fact the pacific bell phone was not working for example.|s
mn021|when i tried the the phone on this booklet it was not working.|s
mn082|huh.|b
mn021|but the thing is that maybe this could be on a starting point or or if digest|s.%-
fn083|yeah.|s^aa
fn083|i don't know.|fh
fn083|maybe i talk with jane about this.|s^cs
fn083|if we can use this information i don't know somewhere on the icsi home page too.|s
mn081|move it on the normal icsi i. c. s. i.|s^2
fn083|yeah.|s^aa
fn083|maybe.|s^am
mn081|maybe every group has somewhere hidden uh a uh deep outgoing|s^am.%-
mn082|we can do that.|s
mn082|yeah but the point is that nobody feel responsible for that.|s^ng
mn082|and if it's|%-
mn081|yeah but uh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group thing.|s^bk|s^df
mn021|it's a common|s.%-
mn082|yes.|s^bk
mn082|uh yes.|s^bk
mn081|uh but|%-
mn082|i see there your point.|s^bk
mn081|okay.|s^bk
mn082|that's right.|s^aa
mn082|but if it is under the networking points the group leader is responsible to get up to date information.|s^df
mn082|i believe we are the group where the people are uh changing much more faster to join the group and to leave the group as other groups.|s^df
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|and so the most problem as as of uh it's likely that uh the people here in this group needs this information um much more uh often as as other groups.|fh|s
mn081|but|fg
mn081|but that could still be applicable if you put it under the icsi site if you take the responsibility for that.|s^df^nd
mn082|yes.|s^bk
mn082|i see|s^bk.%-
fn083|yeah i talk to jane about this.|s^bk|s
mn081|uh|%
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn081|so i think i think both arguments are not an are arguments against having this under the normal i. c. s. i page.|s^ba
mn082|but we we can do that.|s
mn081|or only the networking uh page.|s^ba^e
mn035|but the problem is are you allowed to change anything on the general icsi server?|qy^rt
mn081|yeah.|b
fn083|no.|s^ar
fn083|this is why i have to talk to jane.|s^df
mn035|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah that's|%-
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn035|so you may need just a link from the main icsi page to the n. s. a page.|s^cs
mn082|that's a|%-
mn082|we have the we have the directory structure of the real unix tree in compliance and in accordance with what you with the structure of the web pages.|s
mn082|and um that means uh the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages.|fh|s
mn082|he has access to the n. s. a pages.|s
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|but i think that's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information page must be on the general on the highest level.|s
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|i have no problem with that.|s
mn030|but uh|fg
mn082|but|fh
mn082|but i think we discuss if still|s.%-
mn030|your argument is uh i think it we have to have the right to change it.|s^co
mn035|yeah.|b
mn030|so if there's anything changing in insurances or something something like that that we have access to this page further on to to make any changes.|s^co^df
mn081|yeah.|b
fn083|yeah but this is not a problem at all.|s^bk|s^ng
fn083|i i mean if you are coming from germany and you know that there is something changed with the health insurance then you send jane an email like could you please change this blah blah blah.|s:qy^cs
mn030|yeah but it's much more complicated.|s^bk|s^ng
mn035|yeah but that's that's effort.|s^bk|s
mn035|that's the whole problem that nobody wants to do it.|s^df^nd
mn030|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
fn083|yeah okay.|s^bk
mn082|you know how it you know the process here within the n. s. a group.|s
mn082|you know.|fh
fn083|yes.|s^aa
mn082|and and that was a reason i we finally decided here that we put it information on the n. s. a page.|s^df
mn082|we have this discussed still a couple of months ago ago.|s
mn030|i think the best solution is really to put a link on the i. c. s. i page to this stuff.|s^cs
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn035|yep.|b.%
mn030|and the stuff itself is uh located at our server.|s
mn082|in our directory.|s
mn030|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|in our directory.|s^m^na
mn082|yeah.|b
mn030|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah we can do that.|s^aa|s^na
fn083|yes also fine.|s^aa|s^na
mn082|we then create a link and then we have to ask with jane.|s^co
fn083|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|okay.|s^bk
fn083|another point is i want i want to would like to add another button something which is called like events or i don't know yeah i guess i call it events.|s^cs
mn021|huh.|b
fn083|like where we could uh announce talks which are you know future talks for the future.|s^cs^df
fn083|or and where we could also have a link on for instance the two workshops which have going on uh last summer.|s^cs^df
fn083|so hannes' workshop and then the workshop from oliver.|s^e
fn083|that there might be a link behind these workshops and or former talks we have.|s
fn083|so like from people who have been here before.|s^e
fn083|and he wants to uh publish their slides or an article or whatsoever behind there.|s^e
fn083|so that we have like a button for events which are where workshops can be announced or old workshops could could be um shown or whatever.|s^df
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|of course that is a living thing.|s
mn082|i think it's a good idea.|s^ba
mn082|not only that the workshop was a talk announce because they are still announce it is a broader sense.|s
mn082|uh but i think the idea from claudia is very good that the slides from the talks here if it's worth to have it on the web anyway um should be published in that way that the people can access it.|fh|s^ba^df
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn082|for instance i have my u. s. a. i. a slides.|s^e
mn082|maybe if some things and is going on maybe you have some multicast slides concerning your work at i. g. m. p.|s^cs^e
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|that's okay too.|s^na
mn082|and uh|fh
mn082|and if we have some talks from exterm and we had some in the past we can also put the slides on on these things.|s^cs
mn082|because then they're still still a growing context for us opportunity for the people you know there.|s^df
mn082|oh.|s:s^bk
mn082|this guy did something there.|s:s
mn082|maybe i can contact him and ask him would you like to do something contribute whatever.|s:s
mn021|uhhuh huh.|b
mn082|uh so.|fh
mn082|that's and i think it's a great idea from claudia to to have this event page.|s^ba
mn082|because it's not a big deal.|s^df
mn082|you know.|fh
fn083|no it's easy to to add it.|s^aa|s^df^na
mn082|it's it's|%-
fn083|i mean.|fh
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|and then it's|s.%--
mn082|nah okay.|fg
mn082|if there are no events then there are no events.|s
fn083|yeah yeah.|s^aa
mn082|but we still have a few which happened in the last year.|s^rt
mn082|and okay.|fh|s^bk
mn082|then it is a growing thing.|s
mn082|but it's done automatically that the group leader or the group uh put some things uh also on the web.|s
mn082|something in the center pipe.|s^e
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn082|everybody agree?|qy^d^rt
mn030|um i don't know.|h|s^no
mn021|okay.|s^aa
mn030|maybe it could be a good thing if we have such an event button that um somewhere beneath this button or wherever that there's a date when the last update was.|s^cs
mn030|so that you know it's worth to click this button to see there's a new um announcement or not.|s^df
fn083|yeah okay.|s^bk
mn030|so otherwise you are often clicking this button.|s^df
mn030|and you get your old information or even an uh empty page.|s^df
mn082|maybe there's|%-
fn083|yeah but this will be then down on the button of the page anyways.|s^bk|s^ng
mn082|yeah maybe we can have updated on you know the button itself.|s^bk|s^cs^rt
mn030|so|fh
mn030|yeah.|s^aa
mn030|something like that.|s^na
mn082|and then updated and the current date when when something happened.|s^cs
mn030|last updated.|s^2
mn030|yeah.|b
mn082|i don't know how we deal with that.|s^no
fn083|yep.|b
mn082|is it another thing we have to?|qy^rt
fn083|yep.|b
mn030|so it's just a suggestion.|s
mn030|i don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that.|s^no
mn082|yeah.|b
fn083|huh.|b
fn083|okay.|s^bk
mn082|okay you|s^bk|%--
mn082|well.|fh
mn082|let's consider update event button.|s^t1
mn082|okay.|fg
mn082|so and then the next point and i believe yeah so   not the last one is one that i would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody concerning his future intention here at i. c. s. i or whether when he will leave whether he can or will he consider currently uh contribute here to the proposal.|s^tc
mn082|because you know i've i'm facing the problem if i go back to siemens.|s^df
mn082|and i say okay.|s:s^bk
mn082|there's a potential.|s:s
mn082|there are potential contacts.|s:s
mn082|currently maybe no money.|s
mn082|but if we go in one direction it it is worth to know if people can still go on in that area of that kind of work then they are back in their university or their company or whatever.|s
mn082|and even if it's nur part-time jobs and and if it's come to a real proposal that maybe the people can hook in uh one more time.|s^cs
mn082|because i need this information definitely uh to inform the uh the siemens management that it's worth to send me back here.|s^df
mn082|so maybe wilbert you can start.|s^co
mn082|you will leave end of january definitely.|s
mn082|and currently you see no chance as far as i know uh to stay longer here.|fh|s^rt
mn082|and either you will go back to k. p. n or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company.|s^bu
mn082|is that right?|qy^g^rt
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|can you give us more details of concerning the status?|qy^rt
mn081|no.|s^ar
mn082|no?|qy^bu^d^m^rt
mn081|no.|s^aa
mn081|pending.|s^df
mn082|pending.|s^bk^m
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
fn083|see for me it's the same.|s
fn083|i can also say uh|s.%--
fn083|for me everything has completely changed.|s
fn083|so now i go back and i don't anything what to do.|s
fn083|so it's like i have to sort everything out when i'm back in germany.|s
mn082|yes.|s^bk
mn082|but you have no|s.%-
fn083|but i won't go back to the university.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
fn083|so|fh
fn083|i don't think so.|s^nd
mn082|so you are looking for a job.|s
mn082|that's probably then okay.|s
mn082|in principle i would like to say you are lost for the n. s. a group.|s
fn083|then it's like|s.%-
fn083|yeah.|b
mn082|because ffft that's uh it would be a a wonder if uh it hook in at the same area you know.|s^df
fn083|yeah.|b
fn083|no no no.|s^ar
fn083|yeah.|b
mn081|uh but that's also for me.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|i'm kind of lost for the n. s. a group.|s^df
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|i think so yeah.|s^na
fn083|lost is maybe a bit like|s.%-
mn081|and oh also also|s.%-
mn082|ja.|s^aa
mn082|from the work contributions you know.|s
mn081|well|fg
mn081|but i think even also k. p. n is lost for the uh for the i. c. s. i.|s^rt
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|uh do you know whether they have|qy.%-
mn081|there's a lot of uh budget cuts going on.|s^df
mn081|and nothing is possible anymore.|s
mn081|so|fh
mn082|um so from your side the statement is um that uh independently of your person uh the k. p. n is not they're not willing to send us another guy here to i. c. s. i anyway.|fg|s^bu
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn081|absolutely.|s^na
mn082|and if they are interested in uh a certain kind of project then it must be related to a certain kind of really service or a certain kind of end system or real product or whatever kind of thing with respect to u. m. t. s.|fh|s^bu
mn081|it it will be different thing.|s
mn082|right?|qy^d^g
mn081|it will be a it will be a start-up.|s
mn081|and i know they're they're working on a a few of them in this area.|s
mn081|but it's outside of i. c. s. i.|s
mn082|huh.|s^bk
mn082|so|fg
mn082|k. p. n and and i. c. s. i in principle.|s^bs
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|after you will leave here that is.|s^bs^e
mn082|yeah and then what do you intend to do in the last two months beside of course looking for|s^tc.%-
mn030|holidays.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn081|um i am working now on on something.|fg|s
mn081|uh an open source router.|s^e^rt
mn082|this is that from from mark right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn081|no.|s^ar
mn081|in|%--
mn082|not?|qy^bu^d
mn081|well it's a little bit out of mark.|s^arp
mn081|i'm|%--
mn081|right now i'm interested and i'm looking into it.|s
mn081|and i'm working started yesterday actually working on it.|s
mn081|to do the uh to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by mark um on an open source router that's different from the one that of mark's project.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|yeah do you finish that and do you believe that you can finish that until end of january?|qy^rt
mn081|i hope so.|s^na
mn082|it sounded sounded to me a little bit little bit hard hard hard time constraint right?|s|qy^d^g^rt
mn081|that would be cool.|s^ba
mn081|yeah.|b
mn081|it's|%--
mn081|hard work.|s^2
mn081|yeah.|s^aa
mn081|that's right.|s^aa
mn081|but i'm working on it.|s^df
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|miguel maybe you can say also.|s^co^tc
mn021|oh i'll be i'll be here until the end of july.|s^rt
mn021|and uh|fh
mn021|well uh|fh
mn021|even later if uh there is some interesting work uh going on.|s^e
mn021|well i i will be able to to do some work from spain too.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|so that's my future uh forecast.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn082|and uh do you have some students which could be join if there is|fh|qy.%--
mn021|yeah.|b
mn082|i assume there is a certain activity.|s
mn082|maybe if you will leave in july|s.%-
mn021|yeah well you know uh the problem the i think that we have a a problem or a difference in spain at least compared with the americans.|s^bk|s
mn021|and is that our students are uh are not getting involved in research until they have uh finished their studies.|s^df
mn021|so uh it's something a little bit uh strange.|s^ba
mn021|but it is this this is the|s.%-
mn082|what?|qw^br^rt
mn082|they are not|qy^d.%--
mn082|sorry?|qw^br
mn082|they are not involved in in research?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|you know|%-
mn082|what they are doing then?|qw
mn082|i'm sorry.|s^fa
mn081|lectures.|s
mn082|huh?|qw^br^rt
mn021|you know they|s.%--
mn082|ach so ach so|%
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn021|you you have to to pass the different tests.|s^rt
mn021|and you have to study the different subjects.|s^rt
mn021|and until you have finished with this uh well okay you can do it by by your own.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|but but the thing is that you're not supposed to do it.|s^rt
mn021|and usually students are pretty busy for not doing other things.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|uh|fh
mn030|and there's no final master's thesis or something like that what they have to perform?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn021|uh yeah them nnn not really.|h|s^nd
mn021|you know there is.|s^na
mn021|there is.|s^na^r
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|but uh it is not a research work.|s^df
mn021|usually it's an application work.|s^df
mn021|so you build a web site your own e. commerce site uh whatever.|s
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn021|or a program or|s.%--
mn082|why i didn't study in spain?|qw^j^rt
mn021|but|%-
mn021|but it is not uh something your teacher provides you some research papers and you let's say build a simulator or try to.|s^df
mn082|huh.|b
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn030|uhhuh.|b
mn082|are certain tasks?|qy^rt
mn030|okay.|b
mn082|and so|%-
mn021|so|fg
mn021|we have uh other students are which are uh huh people that has a grant.|s^tc
mn021|and they are they are starting as uh researchers.|s
mn021|ah but this is only connected to your own funding.|fh|s
mn021|so if you if you have projects you can have uh people working with you.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|if you don't have a research project well you cannot pay them.|s
mn021|so usually you don't have anybody.|s
mn021|so it's kind of uh dependent on the funding we have in some projects.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|it's not sure.|s
mn082|no.|s^ar^t3
mn021|not really sure.|s
mn082|there.|s^t3
mn082|we're not talking about to send the students here to i. c. s. i.|s
mn082|i'm talking if there is an activity at least with the n. s. a group that certain kind of activities also in the university could apply for the master works of diplomas thesis uh whatever kind of thing that|s^df.%-
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|we we|%-
mn021|i think we could we could find uh some uh work force.|s
mn021|okay?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn021|because well you you can uh redirect you know the the work as uh let's say as a subject work of something that you can you can try to uh|s.%--
mn021|in some subjects in fact uh the the the uh topics are more open.|s
mn021|so you can introduce some research topics too.|s
mn021|so|fh
mn021|but the main thing is that there is a uh this big difference.|s
mn021|because uh students are not supposed to do research uh work until they have finished their their grade.|s^df
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn081|you can change that.|s
mn021|yeah.|s^aa
mn021|sure.|s^aa
mn081|uh maybe you|s.%--
mn021|sure.|s^aa^r
mn081|i think it's pretty healthy for a student to to have a project uh where you have to write actually some part of research.|s
mn081|or|fh
mn021|yeah i think so too.|s^aa|s^na
mn021|but uh you know it also depends on the subjects.|s
mn021|because sometimes subjects are fixed.|s^df
mn081|sure.|s^aa
mn021|so you cannot you cannot uh uh give any any stuff you want.|s^df
mn081|okay.|s^bk
mn021|you have to to provide a certain a certain prime for the subject too.|s^df
mn081|of course.|s^aa
mn021|but you know sometimes especially in the in the latest uh uh courses uh things are probably more open.|s
mn021|and well it it is something that can be changed.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|okay.|b
mn082|thank you.|s^ft.%
mn082|claudia i still mentioned have you other things?|qy^rt
mn082|for me as i said before i will be funded by a uh by the ministry of uh the german government for research in the project so-called invinet.|s
mn082|that seems to be sure.|s
mn082|and i got absolutely freedom to do what i would like to do.|s
mn082|and i would like to go on with the q. s in advance mechanism.|s
mn082|and uh|fh
mn082|in the relation of u. s. a. i. a i also have the activities with georgia tech.|s
mn082|they have now a p. h. d.|s
mn082|it is settled.|s
mn082|and my other next uh generation of contract is also going in that sense so the topic is still going going on.|s
mn082|and when i will come back here i would like to use these things too to maybe come to a closer a bigger project um outside of this goal with contributions here from uh first of all from the n. s. a group and then from from other partners.|s
mn082|but this i have definitely uh discussed with my management.|s^rt
mn082|and this will happened i believe in december.|s
mn082|maybe and in the beginning of january.|s
mn082|and i will keep informed to the management of i. c. s. i anyway.|s^cc
mn082|but also i assume that my suggestions that we have a weekly phone conference and email exchange during that time.|s^cs
mn082|so that we can inform each other concerning what are the questions what are the problems what is the status and so on.|s^df
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|but i think we will uh detail these things then in one of the last meetings.|s
mn082|so|fh
mn082|how is your status and and your ideas and your plans and your future and|qw.%--
mn030|yeah.|s^bk
mn030|well.|fh
mn030|i will|s.%-
mn082|you're addicted to the testbeds you run on the hour.|s^j
mn030|no no no no no.|s^ar
mn082|so that's|s.%-
mn030|so i will stay here till the end of february.|s^rt
mn030|and|fh
mn030|afterwards um at berlin i'm yeah funded by an institution of the german government.|s
mn030|so|fh
mn030|they are paying me.|s^rt
mn030|and i have to do research for them of course.|s
mn030|i have to um well uh reach some goals and so on.|s
mn030|but on the other hand there will be some time left i think to do some work on this area i started here.|s^rt
mn030|and for me myself i'm also very interested in in continue this work.|s^rt
mn030|and so that will be manageable.|s
mn030|and um|fh
mn030|on the other hand there are also uh some students or|s.%--
mn030|well.|fh
mn030|at the moment it's quite difficult to find students uh who are doing their master's thesis and so on.|s
mn030|because there are not a lot of students uh which are in this state in germany now.|s^df
mn030|but um|fh
mn030|about two years ago the numbers of students were um studying computer science uh started to increase again.|s
mn030|and so in one or two years we will have uh many students uh which are performing their master's thesis.|s
mn030|and so i think there will also be uh many students which are joining in this work.|s
mn030|so hopefully uh i will found will find some students which are joining in.|fh|s
mn030|and um|fh
mn030|so hopefully this work will be go on.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|sounded good to me.|s^ba
mn082|and michael?|qy^co^d^rt
mn035|so i won't change the topic then.|h|s^cc
mn035|i'm here until end of may.|s^rt
mn035|and after that i presumably going to a siemens project with some department of gee mens.|s
mn035|but related to that topic what i have done here.|s
mn035|so|fh
mn035|it's some of pre stage to that.|s
mn035|so it might be more related or loosely related.|s^df
mn035|so it's at least it's in the same topic.|s^bu
mn035|and progress it's going on.|s^rt
mn035|but it's not that fast going on as i would have like it.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn035|oh.|%
mn035|i would like to have it.|s
mn035|sorry.|s^fa
mn035|well.|fh
mn035|but oder?|%
mn082|yeah then what is the current status anyway?|s^bk|qw^rt
mn035|um i'm currently i'm looking into quality of service routing.|h|s
mn082|this is.|s
mn035|and i had discussions with a post doc from the u.   u. c. b.|s
mn035|well.|fh
mn035|we want to we started to collect information to write the paper about quality of serving routing for m. p. l. s in an m. p. l. s domain.|s^rt
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn035|so you have um distributed routing at the edges.|s
mn035|and one aspect is that the information is outdated so that you know to always have the exact information of your links dates and so on.|s
mn035|it what we have plans of that.|s
mn035|and trying to look at some routing policies or routing algorithms.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|b
mn082|now as i see in principle uh fff that's a really raw view.|s^ba
mn082|m. p. l. s offers certain kind of success of active routing.|s
mn082|because in principle the forwarding pass is a little bit decoupled from this from the routing pass.|s^df
mn035|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|and this was in principle.|s^df
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|it's it's not really the subject.|s
mn035|it it|%-
mn082|but in a broader sense it could be seen in that sense.|s
mn035|it yeah.|b
mn082|i think uh there are in a certain degree some alignment with with both of you guys.|s
mn035|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|right?|qy^d^g
mn035|so at least from the definition of christian tschudin m. p. l. s is a subset of of active active routing.|s
mn035|so it's very it's static?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn035|it's no active?|s^ar|qy^bu^d^rt
mn035|but it's sort of active because they have these program statements.|s^df
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|maybe it's a separation in principle that i do not use the normal traditional uh data forwarding pass and update in principle only the routing information uh to to to use it.|s
mn035|but|%-
mn035|yeah.|b
mn035|yeah.|b
mn021|well they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something.|s
mn082|yeah.|b
mn082|yeah.|b
mn035|yeah.|b
mn035|that's right.|s^aa
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn082|so what i mean is at a certain degree yeah that has to be figured out.|s
mn021|yeah.|b
mn021|there's a connection point.|s
mn082|there is uh there are some linkage between them in both of your your work.|s^na
mn021|uhhuh.|b
mn035|yeah.|b
mn082|so|fg
mn082|my last point uh in principle is the proposal itself.|s^tc
mn082|um|fh
mn082|i know in the past it was always if i'm not writing something nothing going to happen.|s
mn082|so i believe wilbert you are going out of these activity.|s
mn082|you have to use your time to finish your work as you uh have in mind until your end of february.|s^co
mn082|or is that right?|qy^g
mn081|january.|s^nd
mn081|yes.|s^aa
mn082|end of january.|s^bk
mn082|sorry.|s^fa
mn082|so you will not you will not find any time to contribute anymore to this activity.|s^bu
mn081|no.|s^aa
mn082|okay.|s^bk
mn082|then from miguel's side i expect more detailed vision.|s^co^rt^tc
mn082|we can do it as i mentioned before bilateral afterwards uh concerning your work and how you think it could be beneficial contribution to the activity maybe based on the generic uh uh u. s. a. i. a architecture.|s^cs
mn021|later.|s^2
mn082|i will write as long as i have time here uh on the proposal itself.|s^cc^rt
mn082|and in the near term future i will distribute a list of the small cluster of people.|s^cc^rt
mn082|i tried to access juan peire several times.|s
mn082|he didn't answer because he still had mentioned that there's some minor funding that i think would help.|s
mn082|for instance to have initial meeting either here or in europe or or wherever.|s^e
mn082|i've uh contact one more time the professor.|s
mn082|what is his name?|qw
mn082|rao?|qy^d
mn082|or|qrr.%--
mn082|uh landay mentioned uh|fh|s.%-
mn035|landay?|qy^d^rt
mn082|rao right?|s|qy^d^g^rt
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn082|because he's a professor in uh responsible for the infrastructure at u. c. b and he has some projects which are related to um these these uh activities.|s
mn035|landay.|s^bk
mn035|uh.|s^bk.%
mn082|i would name it intelligent classroom.|s
mn082|i don't know whether i can succeed to get an appointment then.|s^no
mn082|but i will distribute a list contact list and the interests of each partner.|s^cc
mn082|so that everybody can see and everybody knows yeah i have in mind.|s^df
mn082|maybe it's a small n. s. a group activity itself with no linkage to the outer world.|s^am
mn082|maybe it's a n. s. a group activity with a linkage to the outer world based on the uh universities at home or the companies at home.|s^am
mn082|there's some linkage.|s
mn082|and the third stage is let's say there's a n. s. a group activity in this area uh with the supported um home entities and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or or universities here in this area.|s
mn082|the last one i think it's uh the best one.|s^ba
mn082|but you see the question is always where's the money.|s
mn082|and i say oh poo.|s:s^fe
mn082|currently i don't know.|s:s^no
mn082|the second question is how long i stay here.|s
mn082|and say ooo i don't know.|s:s^no
mn082|so|fh
mn082|everybody's waiting.|s
mn082|yeah?|qy^d^f^g
mn082|and the only um activity could come from the n. s. a group itself.|s
mn082|but i think it's a a work in process and that it will take some time and uh everything must be just settled a little bit more.|s
mn082|so but anyway i would like to get contributions from the people here of the n. s. a group concerning proposals.|fg|s^cs
mn082|this is a living thing.|s^df
mn082|and|fh
mn082|it's a pity that multicast is in principle removed.|s^ba
mn082|and we do not have any expert from multicast anymore.|s
mn082|and uh that's makes very hard i believe.|fh|s
mn082|because that is a major at least twenty five percent of the whole network uh stuff.|s^df
mn082|and um|fh
mn082|but neverless we have to live with this situation.|s
mn082|right.|fh
mn082|you are laughing again?|qy^bu^d
mn081|right.|s^aa
mn081|right.|s^aa^r
mn082|so maybe we have to rewrite something.|s^cs
mn082|have new ideas going forward more in certain kind of really telecommunication network and the routing and q. s stuff.|s^cs^rt
mn082|and remove in principle the multicast stuff.|s^rt
mn082|which in principle a pity because i think that's a really really good uh uh huh source of research work for the future telecommunication core networks.|s^ba^e
mn082|because they are still not able to deal with multicast.|s^df
mn082|they still have there that tunnel generations and all those kind of things.|s^df
mn082|and i i believe that would be very beneficial to use it for the really uh mobile scenarios in in that network.|fh|s^ba^df
mn082|so but anyway we have to live with a real situation.|s
mn082|and that means we have to drop multicast from the proposal.|s
mn082|any comments?|qy^d^rt
mn021|oh not really you know.|s^nd
mn021|uh i i i i think that well in the future somebody will come to the n. s. a group.|fh|s
mn021|uh|fh
mn082|then we can extend the proposal one more time with multicast.|s
mn021|uh|%
mn021|so|fh
mn021|no i mean that|s^ar|s.%--
mn021|okay.|fg
mn021|i i i think that it cannot uh be uh considered the first type task to do.|s^nd
mn021|because nobody is is knowledgeable about multicasting.|s^df
mn021|but i think that uh any of us could address these things in the future.|s^cs
mn021|or maybe a new person could address this in the future.|s^cs
mn021|so|fh
mn021|if|%--
mn021|i mean what i think is that uh it it makes no sense to me to reduce uh uh uh uh something which is more or less complete.|s
mn021|because we don't have the person.|s^df
mn021|i think that the the way to to go is probably the opposite to try to find something which has a meaning by itself.|s^cs
mn021|and then try to get the resources to to to do this.|s^cs
mn082|oh maybe you understand me in the wrong way.|s^ng
mn082|uh|fh
mn082|i do not mean to drop it to remove the text from the proposal.|s^df
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|i mean activities planning activities.|s^df
mn021|sorry.|s^fa
mn021|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|that's okay.|s
mn082|work packages.|s
mn021|sorry sorry.|s^fa
mn021|heh.|fh
mn082|yeah.|s^bk
mn021|now i|%-
mn082|so|fg
mn082|no no.|s^ar
mn082|because that's uh that's why i mentioned that it is important thing.|s
mn082|but currently there's only one new group member sven buchholz who will figure out the thing huh how to say um the taking into account the end system or the limited end system capabilities with respect to mobility and the network itself.|fh|s
mn082|where it should be where should be uh the adaptation process performed to deal with the different devices for ubiquitous access to the network?|qw
mn082|should it be in the end system itself?|qy^rt
mn082|should be in the edge device?|qy
mn082|it should it be in the core?|qy^d
mn082|should it be on the server?|qy
mn082|these are the questions he would like to figure out.|s
mn082|and to uh to have in principle the pro and cons of uh different of all these different approaches.|s
mn082|so that's the only new member.|s
mn081|who is that?|qw^rt
mn082|sven buchholz.|s
mn082|he was here.|s^e
mn082|i invited him and discussed with him his potential work i.|s^e
mn082|quite sure.|s
mn081|oh he was here one day.|s^bk|s^bu
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
fn083|yeah.|s^aa
mn035|huh.|s^aa
mn082|but he showed up the next day.|s^e
mn035|several days.|s^e
mn082|but only for administration stuff.|s^e
mn035|yeah.|b
mn082|but for the technical discussion he was here one day.|s^e
mn035|yeah.|b
mn035|yeah.|b
mn082|i'm do not remember whether whether you were|s^no.%-
fn083|that must be three weeks ago.|s
fn083|because i i just met him when i arrived.|s^df
mn081|yeah i do remember him.|s^bk|s
mn035|yeah.|b
mn081|but i didn't talk with him about uh about the research topic.|s
mn082|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn081|so i didn't know what he was going to do.|s^df
mn082|yeah he will come mid of january i believe.|s^bk|s
mn082|yeah.|s^aa
mn035|uhhuh.|b
mn082|as far as i know.|s^df
mn082|so but this is the only guy you know.|s
mn082|but that is not reflected in that sense that we remove the text.|s
mn082|what i mean is is uh the that we what's kind of activity we are going more in detail in describing the network packages and and detailed uh uh descriptions more detailed descriptions.|s
mn021|okay.|s^bk
mn082|so|fh
mn082|any other question?|qy^d^rt
mn082|any other comment?|qy^d
mn082|oh.|s^bk
mn082|then we should start with reading the numbers.|s^co^tc
mn082|one more time.|s
fn083|oh again?|qy^d^rt
mn081|we have to do that?|qy^d^rt
mn081|oh.|s^bk
mn082|yes.|s^aa
mn082|we have to do it.|s^na
fn083|i don't know.|s^no
mn082|so that means we have to read the transcript script number and then the numbers.|s
mn082|and if there's a new line a short break.|s
mn082|and afterwards we have to|fh|s.%--
mn082|uh that device is switched on.|fh|s
mn082|so please do not switch off the devices.|s^cs
mn082|and i will call herr janin and that adam.|s
mn082|so i will start.|s^cc
mn082|okay the next one please.|z
fn083|should i?|z
mn082|oh yeah yeah fine.|z
fn083|okay.|z
mn082|he's laughing all the time.|z
fn083|oh oh wilbert.|z
fn083|oh i'm sorry.|z
mn081|did you get that?|z
fn083|oh i'm so sorry.|z
fn083|that was mean.|z
fn083|okay.|z
mn081|no it wasn't.|z
mn081|i i i saw it already standing there when i was here so then i started laughing.|z
mn081|oh oh.|z
mn082|okay michael please.|z
mn030|that's it.|z
mn082|okay.|z
mn082|thank you.|z
mn082|okay.|z
mn082|then i will call adam.|z
mn082|adam?|z
me026|channel one.|z
mn007|test.|z
fn002|hello.|z
me026|channel three.|z
mn007|test.|z
me018|uhoh.|z
me013|so you think we're going now.|s
me013|yes?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|okay good.|s
me013|all right.|fg
me013|going again.|s
me013|uh so we're going to go around as before and uh do do our digits.|fh|s^co^t
me006|okay this is barry chen and i am reading transcript|z
me013|uh yeah you don't actually need to say the name.|fh|s^t3
me013|that'll probably be bleeped out.|s^t3
me006|okay.|s^bk^t3
me013|so|fh
me013|that's if these are anonymized.|s
me013|but yeah|fh
me006|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|uh i mean not that there's anything defamatory about uh eight five seven or or anything.|fh|s^j
me013|but|fh
me013|uh anyway.|fh|s^tc
me006|okay.|b
me013|uh so here's what i have for i i was just jotting down things i think that we should do today.|fh|s^t
me013|uh this is what i have for an agenda so far.|fh|s^t
me013|um we should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh the field trip next week.|fh|s^co^t
me013|uh a number of us are doing a field trip to uh uh o g i.|fh|s^rt
me013|and uh mostly first though about the logistics for it.|fh|s
me013|then maybe later on in the meeting we should talk about what we actually you know might accomplish.|s^co^t
me013|uh|fh
me006|okay.|b
me013|uh in and kind of go around see what people have been doing talk about that a progress report um essentially.|fh|s^co^t
me013|um and then uh another topic i had was that uh uh uh dave here had uh said uh give me something to do.|fh|s^t
me013|and i i have i have uh failed so far in doing that.|s
me013|and so maybe we can discuss that a little bit.|s^co^t
me013|if we find some holes in some things that that someone could use some help with he's he's volunteering to help.|s
me018|i've got to move a bunch of furniture.|s^j
me013|okay always count on a serious comment from that corner.|s^bk|s
me013|so um|fh
me013|uh and uh then uh talk a little bit about about disks and resource resource issues that that's starting to get worked out.|fh|s^co^t
me013|and then anything else anybody has that isn't in that list?|qo^d
me013|uh|fh
me026|i was just wondering does this mean the battery's dying and i should change it?|qy^rt
me013|uh i think that means the battery's okay.|h|s^nd
me013|d do you|%
me018|let me see.|s^co
me026|oh okay.|s^bk
me026|so|fh
me018|yeah that's good.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|you're all right.|s
me026|because it's full.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me026|all right.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|b
me013|it looks full of electrons.|s
me013|okay.|fh
me013|plenty of electrons left there.|s
me013|okay.|fh
me013|so um|fh
me013|uh|fh
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so uh i wanted to start this with this mundane thing.|fh|s^t
me013|um|fh
me013|uh i i it was it was kind of my bright idea to have us take a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning.|s
me013|um.|fh
me006|oh yeah that's right.|s^bk
me013|uh this is uh the reason i did it uh was because otherwise for those of us who have to come back the same day it is really not much of a of a visit.|fh|s^df^e
me013|uh|fh
me013|so um the issue is how how how would we ever accomplish that?|fh|qw
me013|uh|fh
me013|what what what part of town do you live in?|qw^rt
me006|um i live in um the corner of campus.|h|s
me006|the um southeast corner.|s^e
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay so would it be easier|fg|qy.%--
me013|those of you who are not you know used to this area it can be very tricky to get to the airport at at uh you know six thirty.|s
me013|um so would it be easier for you if you came here and i drove you?|fh|qw
me013|yeah?|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|yeah perhaps yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah yeah okay.|s^bk
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
me006|yeah sure.|s^aa
me013|okay so if if everybody can get here at six.|fg|s^cs
fn002|at six.|s^m
me013|yeah i'm afraid we need to do that to get there on time.|s^aa|s^df
me006|six okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah so.|fh
me013|oh boy!|s^fe
me013|anyway.|fg
me013|so|fh
me018|will that be enough time?|qy^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah so i'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front.|s^cc
me013|and uh and yeah that'll be plenty of time.|fh|s^na
me013|it'll take it it it won't be bad traffic that time of day.|s
me013|and and uh|fh
me018|i guess once you get past the bridge that that would be the worst.|s
me013|going to oakland.|s^nd
me034|yeah oakland.|s^nd
me006|oakland.|s^nd
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me013|bridge.|s
me018|once you get past the turnoff to the bay bridge.|s
me013|oh the turnoff to the bridge.|s^bk
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me013|won't even do that.|s^nd
me013|i mean just go down martin luther king.|s
me034|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|okay.|s^bk
me013|and then martin luther king to nine eighty to eight eighty.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me013|and it's it'd take us tops uh thirty minutes to get there.|s
me018|oh i|b
me013|so that leaves us fifty minutes before the plane.|s
me013|it'll just|s.%--
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|great.|s^ba
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so that'll|s.%--
me013|it's i mean it's still not going to be really easy.|s
me013|but well particularly for for uh for barry and me.|s
me013|we're not we're not staying overnight.|s
me013|so we don't need to bring anything particularly except for uh a pad of paper.|s
me013|and so and uh you two have to bring a little bit.|fh|s
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|but uh you know don't don't bring a footlocker and we'll be okay.|fh|s^co^j
me013|so|fh
me013|you're staying overnight.|s
me006|so just|%-
me013|i figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase.|s
mn007|oh yeah yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|that's sort of one night.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|anyway.|fh
me006|so six a m in front.|s^bu
me013|okay.|fg
me013|six a m in front.|s
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|uh i'll be here.|fh|s
me013|uh i'll i'll i'll i'll give you my phone number.|fh|s^cc
me013|if i'm not here for a few after a few minutes then|s^j.%-
me006|wake you up.|s^cs
me013|nah i'll be fine.|s
me013|i just uh it for me it just means getting up a half an hour earlier than i usually do.|s
me013|not not not a lot.|s
me006|okay wednesday.|s^bk.%
me013|so|fh
me013|okay.|fg
me013|that was the real real important stuff.|s
me013|um i i i figured maybe wait on the potential goals for the meeting uh until we talk about what's been going on.|fh|s^co
me013|so uh what's been going on?|fh|qw
me013|why don't we start start over here.|s^cs
mn007|um well preparation of the french test data actually.|h|s^rt
me013|okay.|b
mn007|so it means that um|s.%--
mn007|well it is uh a digit french database of microphone speech.|s
mn007|downsampled to eight kilohertz.|s
mn007|i've added noise to one part with the actually the aurora two noises.|s^rt
mn007|and so this is a training part.|s
mn007|and then the remaining part i use for testing and with other kind of noises.|s
mn007|so we can.|s
mn007|so this is almost ready.|s^rt
mn007|i'm preparing the the h t k baseline for this task.|s
mn007|and yeah.|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|uh|fh
me013|so the h t k base lines so this is using mel cepstra and so on.|s
me013|or|fh
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah okay.|fh
me013|and again i guess the the plan is uh to uh then given this|s.%--
me013|what's the plan again?|qw^rt
mn007|the plan with these data?|qy^bu^d
me013|with|%--
me013|so so does just remind me of what what you were going to do with the what what what what's|s^co.%--
me013|you just described what you've been doing.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so if you could remind me of what you're going to be doing.|s^co
me013|oh this is|%--
mn007|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
me013|yeah yeah.|b
me006|tell him about the cube.|s^co
mn007|the cube.|s^bk^rt
mn007|i should tell him about the cube.|s
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me013|oh cube yeah.|s^bk|s^aa
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|uh we actually we want to huh uh uh analyze three dimensions.|s
fn002|fill in the cube.|s^co
mn007|the feature dimension the training data dimension and the test data dimension.|s^e
mn007|um|fh
mn007|well what we want to do is first we have number for each uh task.|s
mn007|so we have the um t i digit task the italian task the french task and the finnish task.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|so we have numbers with uh systems i mean i mean neural networks trained on the task data.|s^rt
mn007|and then to have systems with neural networks trained on uh data from the same language if possible with well using a more generic database which is phonetically phonetically balanced.|s
mn007|and um.|fh
mn007|yeah so|%
me013|so we had talked i guess we had talked at one point about maybe the language i d corpus.|s
me013|is that a possibility for that?|qy^rt
mn007|uh yeah but uh these corpus there is a call home and a call friend also.|s^aa|s
mn007|the call friend is for language identification.|s^e
mn007|well anyway these corpus are all telephone speech.|s
mn007|so um this could be a a problem for why?|qw^d
mn007|because uh uh the the speech dat databases are not telephone speech.|s
mn007|they are downsampled to eight kilohertz.|s
mn007|but but they are not uh with telephone bandwidth.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|that's really funny.|s
me013|isn't it?|qy^g^rt
me013|i mean because th this whole thing is for developing new standards for the telephone.|s^df
me006|telephone.|s^2
me013|yeah.|fh
mn007|yeah but the the idea is to compute the feature before the before sending them to the|s^bk|s^nd.%--
mn007|well you do not send speech you send features computed on the the device.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah i know.|s^bk
me013|but the reason|s.%-
mn007|or well.|fh
me013|oh i see.|s^bk
me013|so your point is that it's it's it's uh the features are computed locally and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth uh or telephone distortions.|s^bu
mn007|so you|%-
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me018|did you happen to find out anything about the o g i multilingual database?|qy^rt
me013|yeah that's that's that's what i meant.|s^bk
mn007|yeah it's|s^aa|s.%-
me013|i said there's there's there's an o g i language i d not the not the uh|s.%--
me013|the callfriend is a is a uh l d c thing right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
mn007|yeah there are also two other databases.|s^aa|s^rt
mn007|one they call the multi language database and another one is a twenty two language something like that.|s^e
mn007|but it's also telephone speech.|s^e
me018|oh they are?|qy^bh^rt
me018|okay.|s^bk
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|well nnn|fg
me013|but i'm not sure|s.%--
mn007|so|%--
me013|i mean the bandwidth shouldn't be such an issue.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|because this is downsampled and and filtered.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|so it's just the fact that it's not telephone.|s
me013|and there are so many other differences between these different databases.|s
me013|i mean some of this stuff's recorded in the car.|s
me013|and some of it's|s.%--
me013|i mean there's there's many different acoustic differences.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|so i'm not sure if i mean unless we're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database i'm not sure if it's completely rules it out.|s^no
me013|if our if we if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there's going to be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse to sort of add another mismatch if you will?|qy
me013|uh i i guess the question is how important is it to for us to get multiple languages uh in there.|fh|s
mn007|yeah but uhhuh um|s^bk|%--
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|well actually for the moment if we do not want to use these phone databases we we already have uh english spanish and french uh with microphone speech.|s^cs
mn007|uh|fh
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|so|fh
me013|so that's what you're thinking of using is sort of the the equivalent of the multiple?|qy^d
mn007|well.|fh
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|for the multilingual part we were thinking of using these three databases.|s^na^rt
me013|and for the difference in phonetic context that you provide that.|s
mn007|well this|%-
mn007|uh actually these three databases are um generic databases.|h|s^rt
fn002|yeah.|b
mn007|so for for uh italian which is close to spanish french and uh t i digits we have both uh digits training data and also more general training data.|s^e
mn007|so huh|fh
me013|well we also have this broadcast news that we were talking about taking off the disk which is is microphone data for for english.|s^cs
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|yeah perhaps yeah there is also timit.|s^bk|s^cs
mn007|we could use timit.|s^cs^rt
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|right.|s^bk
me013|yeah so there's plenty of stuff around.|s^bk|s
me013|okay so anyway the basic plan is to uh test this cube.|fg|s^bs
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yes.|%
fn002|to fill in the cube.|s^bsc
me013|to fill fill it in.|s^m^na
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn007|yeah and perhaps um we were thinking that perhaps the cross language issue is not uh so big of a issue.|fg|s
mn007|well we perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross language stuff.|s^cs
mn007|i mean uh training training a net on a language and testing for another language.|s^cs^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|but that's|%-
mn007|perhaps the most important is to have neural networks trained on the target languages but uh with a general database general databases.|s^cs^rt
mn007|so that well the the guy who has to develop an application with one language can use the net trained on that language or a generic net.|s^df
me013|uh it it depends how you mean using the net.|fg|s^aap
mn007|but not trained on a|s.%-
me013|so if you're talking about for producing these discriminative features that we're talking about you can't do that.|s^nd
mn007|huh.|b
me013|because because the what they're asking for is is a feature set.|s^df
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|and so uh we're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|but if we say no you have to have a different feature set for each language i think this is going to be very bad.|s^nd
me006|oh.|s^bk
me013|so|fh
mn007|you think so.|s^t3
fn002|oh.|%
me006|that's|s^t3.%-
mn007|huh.|b
me013|oh yeah.|s^bk
me013|yeah i mean in principle i mean conceptually it's sort of like they want a well they want a replacement for mel cepstra.|s
mn007|huh.|b
me013|so we say okay this is the year two thousand.|s
me013|we've got something much better than mel cepstra.|s
me013|it's you know gobbledy gook.|s
me013|okay and so we give them these gobbledy gook features.|s
me013|but these gobbledy gook features are supposed to be good for any language.|s
mn007|huh|b
me013|because you don't know who's going to call.|s^df
me013|and you know i mean so it's it's it's uh|s.%--
me013|uh how do you know what language it is?|fh|qw
me013|somebody picks up the phone.|s
me013|so this is their image.|s
mn007|well i chh|fg|%-
me013|someone picks up the phone right?|s|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|and and he he picks up the|s.%-
mn007|yeah but the the application is|fg|s.%-
mn007|there is a target language for the application.|s
mn007|so if a|fh|%-
me013|yeah|fg
me013|well|fh
mn007|well|fg
me013|but no but you you pick up the phone.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^bk^rt
me013|you talk on the phone.|s
me013|and it sends features out.|s
me013|okay.|fh
me013|so the phone doesn't know what a what what your language is.|s
mn007|yeah  .|b
mn007|if|%-
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|if it's in the phone.|s^aap
mn007|but|%--
mn007|well it that that could be at the server's side.|s^df
me013|but that's the image that they have.|s^df
mn007|and well huh yeah.|fh
me013|it could be.|s^aap
me013|but that's the image they have.|s^df
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|so that's that's|s.%--
me013|i mean one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years.|s
me013|but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it's distributed speech recognition where the uh uh probabilistic part and and semantics and so forth are all on the servers and you compute features of the uh on the phone.|s
me013|so that's that's what we're involved in.|s
me013|we might might or might not agree that that's the way it will be in ten years.|s
me013|but that's that's that's what they're asking for.|s
me013|so so i think that it is an important issue whether it works cross language.|s
me013|now it's the o g i uh folks' perspective right now that probably that's not the biggest deal.|s
me013|and that the biggest deal is the um acoustic environment mismatch.|s
me013|and they may very well be right.|s
me013|but i i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true.|s^cs
me013|if that's true we don't need to worry so much.|s
me013|maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh uh that that that the rest doesn't matter.|s
me013|um the other thing is uh this notion of training to uh which i i guess they're starting to look at up there training to something more like articulatory features.|fh|s
me013|uh and if you have something that's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across you know a wide range of languages.|fh|s
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
me013|uh but|fh
me013|yeah so i don't i know unfortunately i don't i see what you're where you're coming from i think.|fh|s
me013|but i don't think we can ignore it.|s
mn007|so we we really have to do test with a real cross language.|s
mn007|i mean for instance training on english and testing on italian.|s^e^rt
mn007|or or we can train or else uh can we train a net on uh a range of languages and which can include the test the test the target language.|s^cs
me006|test on an unseen.|s^t3
mn007|or|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so um|fh
me013|there's there's uh|s.%--
me013|this is complex.|s
me013|so ultimately uh as i was saying i think it doesn't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language.|s^nd
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|now can you include uh the the target language?|qy
me013|um from a purist's standpoint it'd be nice not to.|fh|s
me013|because then you can say when|s.%--
me013|because surely someone is going to say at some point okay so you put in the german and the finnish.|s
mn007|huh.|b
me013|uh now what do you do uh when somebody has portuguese?|fh|qw
me013|you know?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|um and uh however you aren't it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation.|fh|s
me013|so i would say if it looks like there's a big difference to put it in then we'd make note of it and then we probably put in the other.|s
me013|because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that you know it's not so bad as long as we we note it and say look we did do this.|s^df
mn007|huh?|%
me018|and so ideally what you'd want to do is you'd want to run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages.|s^cs
me013|uh|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah perhaps.|s^am
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|and that way you can say well you know we're going to build it for what we think are the most common ones.|s
me018|but if that somebody uses it with a different language you know here's what's you're here's what's likely to happen.|s
me013|yeah because the truth is is that it's it's not like there are i mean although there are thousands of languages uh from uh uh the point of view of cellular companies there aren't.|fg|s
me013|there's you know there's fifty or something.|s
me018|right.|s^bk
me013|you know.|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|uh and they aren't you know with the exception of finnish which i guess it's pretty different from most most things.|fh|s
me013|uh it's it's uh most of them are like at least some of the others.|fh|s
me013|so our guess that spanish is like italian and and so on.|s
me013|i guess finnish is a is is a little bit like hungarian supposedly.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|or is|%--
me013|i think|%--
me018|i don't know anything about finnish.|s^no
me013|well i oh well i know that uh i mean i'm not a linguist but i guess hungarian and finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former soviet union are in this sort of same family.|s
me013|but they're just these you know uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another have i guess people rode in on horses and brought their|s.%--
me018|huh.|b
me018|huh.|b
me013|okay.|fh
mn007|the|%--
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
me013|your turn.|s^co^t^tc
me006|oh my turn.|s^bk
me006|oh okay.|s^bk
me006|um let's see i i spent the last week uh looking over stephane's shoulder and and understanding some of the data.|h|s
me006|i reinstalled um um h t k the free version.|s
me006|so um everybody's now using three point o.|fh|s
me006|which is the same version that uh o g i is using.|s^e
me013|oh good.|s^ba
me006|yeah.|s^bk
me006|so|fh
me006|without without any licensing big deals or anything like that.|s^e
me006|and um so we've been talking about this this uh cube thing.|fh|s
me006|and it's beginning more and more looking like the uh the borge cube thing.|s
me006|it's really gargantuan.|s^e
me006|um|fh
me006|but i'm am i|%-
me013|so are are you going to be assimilated?|qy^j^rt
me018|resistance is futile.|s^j
me006|exactly.|s^aa
me006|um yeah so i've been looking at uh uh timit stuff.|fg|s^rt
me006|um the the stuff that we've been working on with timit trying to get a um a labels file so we can uh train up a train up a net on timit and test um the difference between this net trained on timit and a net trained on digits alone.|fh|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
me006|um and seeing if if it hurts or helps.|fh|s
me013|and again when just to clarify when you're talking about training up a net you're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach?|qy^bu^d
me006|anyway|fh.%
me006|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me006|um|fh
me013|and and the inputs are p l p and delta and that sort of thing.|s^e
me006|uhhuh.|b
me006|well the inputs are one dimension of the cube.|s
me013|or|%
me006|which um we've talked about it being uh p l p um m f c cs um j rasta j rasta l d a.|s^e
mn007|huh.|b
me013|yeah but your initial things you're making one choice there.|s^bk|s^bu
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|which is p l p or something?|qy^bu^d^e^rt
me006|right.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me006|um i i haven't i haven't decided on on the initial thing.|h|s^no
me006|probably probably something like p l p.|s^na
me006|yeah.|b
mn007|huh.|b
me013|um|fg
me013|so so you take p l p and you you uh do it uh you you uh use h t k with it with the transformed features using a neural net that's trained.|fh|s^bu
me013|and the training could either be from digits itself or from timit.|s^bu
me013|and that's the|s.%--
me006|right.|b.x
me013|and and and then the testing would be these other things which which which might be foreign language.|s
me006|right.|b.x
me013|i see.|s^bk
me006|right.|b.x
me013|i i i get in the picture about the cube.|s
me006|yeah|b.x
me013|okay.|fg
me006|maybe.|s^am
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay.|fg
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|i mean those listening to this will not have a picture either.|s
me013|so um i guess i'm i'm not any worse off.|fh|s
me013|but|%-
me013|but at some point somebody should just show me the cube.|s^cs
me013|it sounds|s.%--
me013|i i get i think i get the general idea of it.|s
me006|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me018|so when you said that you were getting the labels for timit um are what do you mean by that?|qw
me006|uhhuh.|s^bk
me006|oh i'm just i'm just uh transforming them from the um the standard timit transcriptions into into a nice long huge p file to do training.|s^bk|s
me018|huh.|s^bk
me018|were the digits um hand labeled for phones?|qy^rt
me006|um the the digits|h|s.%-
me018|or were they those labels automatically derived?|qrr
me006|oh yeah.|s^aa
me006|those were those were automatically derived by by dan using um embedded embedded training and alignment.|s
me018|huh.|s^bk
me013|uh but which dan?|fg|qw
me006|uh ellis.|h|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me006|right.|b
me013|okay.|b
me006|yeah so.|%
me018|i was just wondering because that test you're|s.%--
me006|uhhuh.|b
me018|i i think you're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not uh having general speech performs as well as having specific speech.|s
me006|that's right.|s^aa
me013|well especially when you go over the different languages again.|s^na
me013|because you'd the different languages have different words for the different digits.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|and i was|s.%--
me013|so it's|%-
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|so i was just wondering if the fact that timit you're using the hand labeled stuff from timit might be confuse the results that you get.|s
me013|i i think it would.|s^aa
me013|but but on the other hand it might be better.|s
me018|right but if it's better it may be better because it was hand labeled.|s^bk|s^df
me013|oh yeah.|s^aa
me013|but still probably use it.|s
me018|yeah okay.|b.%
me013|i mean|fg
me013|you know i i i guess i'm sounding cavalier.|s
me013|but i mean i think the point is you have uh a bunch of labels and and they're hand uh hand marked.|s
me013|uh i guess actually timit was not entirely hand marked.|fh|s
me013|it was automatically first and then hand hand corrected.|s
me013|but but um uh it it um it might be a better source.|fh|s
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|so it's|s.%--
me013|you're right.|s^aa
me013|it would be another interesting scientific question to ask is it because it's a broad source or because it was you know carefully?|qr
me013|uh and that's something you could ask.|fh|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|but given limited time i think the main thing is if it's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|then it's probably|s.%-
me018|right.|b
me018|what about the differences in the phone sets?|qw
me006|uh between languages?|h|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|no between timit and the the digits.|s^ar|s^nd
me006|oh.|s^bk
me006|um right.|fh|s^bk
me006|well there's a mapping from the sixty one phonemes in timit to to fifty six the icsi fifty six.|s
fn002|sixty one.|s^t3
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|i see.|s^bk
me006|and then the digits phonemes um there's about twenty twenty two or twenty four of them.|s^rt
me006|is that right?|qy
me018|out of that fifty six?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn007|yep.|s^aa
me006|out of that fifty six.|s^m^na
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
me006|yeah.|s^bk
me006|so|fh
me006|it's it's definitely broader.|s
me006|yeah.|fh
mn007|but actually the issue of uh phoneme mappings will arise when we will do use several languages.|s
fn002|yeah.|b
mn007|because you well some phonemes are not uh in every languages.|s
mn007|so we plan to develop a subset of the phonemes uh that includes uh all the phonemes of our training languages.|s
mn007|and use a network with kind of one hundred outputs or something like that.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|you mean a superset sort of.|s^bu
mn007|uh yeah.|h|s^aa
mn007|superset.|s^m^na
me013|yeah yeah.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|yeah.|s^bk
fn002|i i looks the sampa phone.|s^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|sampa phone for english uh american english and the the the language who have more phone are the english.|s
me018|huh.|s^bk
fn002|of the these language.|s^e
fn002|but for example in spain the spanish have several phone that doesn't appear in the english and we thought to complete.|s
fn002|but for that it needs we must do a lot of work because we need to generate new transcription for the database that we have.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me034|other than the language is there a reason not to use the timit phone set?|qy^rt
me034|because it's larger.|s^e
me034|as opposed to the icsi phone set.|s^e
me006|oh.|s^bk
me006|you mean why map the sixty one to the fifty six?|qy^bu
me034|yeah.|s^aa
me006|i don't know.|s^no
me006|i have|%-
me013|um i forget if that happened starting with you or was it or if it was eric afterwards who did that.|fg|s
me013|but i think basically there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me018|and i think some of them they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning.|s
me034|oh.|s^bk
me018|when really they're both silence.|s
me018|i i think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty six.|s
me034|okay.|b
me013|yeah especially in a system like ours which is a discriminative system.|s^bk|s
me013|you know you're really asking this net to learn.|s
me034|yeah.|s^bk
me018|yeah.|b
me013|it's it's kind of hard.|s
me018|there's not much difference really.|s
me018|and the ones that are gone i think are i think there was they also in timit had like a glottal stop.|s
me018|which was basically a short period of silence.|s^e
me034|uhhuh.|b
me018|and so|fh
me034|well we have that now too right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
me018|i don't know.|s^no
me034|yeah.|s^bk
me013|it's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like like say thirty nine phone symbols.|s^bu
me018|so|fh
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|uh and then they get the variety by by bringing in the context the phonetic context.|fh|s
me013|uh so we actually have an unusually large number in in what we tend to use here.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|so actually maybe now you've got me sort of intrigued.|s
me013|what there's|%--
me013|can you describe what what's on the cube?|qy^co^rt
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me013|i mean|%-
me006|i i think that's a good idea.|s^na
me013|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me006|to to talk about the whole cube.|s^e
fn002|yeah yeah.|s^aa
me006|and maybe we could sections in the cube for people to work on.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me006|um|fh
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|okay.|fg
me006|uh do you want to do it?|fg|qy^t3
me013|so even even though the meeting recorder doesn't doesn't uh|s.%--
me013|and since you're not running a video camera we won't get this.|s
me013|but if you use a board it'll help us anyway.|s
me006|okay.|b
me013|uh point out one of the limitations of this medium.|s^e
me006|okay.|b
me013|but you've got the wireless on.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me006|i have the wireless.|s^na
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so you can walk around.|s
me006|okay.|s^bk
me006|can can you walk around too?|qy^bu^rt
me006|no.|s^ar
me006|okay.|fg
me006|well.|fg
me013|uh he can't actually.|s^nd
me006|um|fg
me013|but|%
me013|he's tethered.|s^e
me006|basically the the cube will have three dimensions.|s
me006|the first dimension is the the features that we're going to use.|s^e
me006|and the second dimension um is the training corpus.|s^e^rt
me006|and that's the training on the discriminant neural net.|s^e
me006|um|fh
me006|and|fh
me006|the last dimension happens to be|s^e.%-
me013|yeah and again|fg|s.%--
me013|yeah so the the training for h t k is always that's always set up for the individual test.|s^bk|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|that there's some training data and some test data.|s
me013|so that's different than this.|s^bu
me006|right right.|s^aa
me006|this is this is for for a n n only.|s^e
me006|and yeah the training for the h t k models is always uh fixed for whatever language you're testing on.|s^e
me013|right.|s^bk
me006|and then there's the testing corpus.|s
me006|so then i think it's probably instructive to go and and and show you the features that we were talking about.|s^cs
me006|um|fh
me006|so let's see.|s
me006|help me out with|s^co.%-
mn007|p l p.|s^rt
me006|with what?|qy^br^d^rt
mn007|p l p.|s^rt

me006|j rasta l d a.|s^m^rt
mn007|um|fh
mn007|multi band.|s
me006|multi band.|s^m^rt
mn007|so there would be multi band before um before our network i mean.|s
me006|yeah.|s^bk
me006|just the multi band features right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|and|%-
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me006|yeah.|b
mn007|so something like uh t c t within bands.|s^cs
me013|uh uh.|b
mn007|and well|fh
mn007|and then multi band after networks meaning.|s^cs
mn007|that we would have uh neural networks uh discriminant neural networks for each band.|s^rt
mn007|uh yeah.|fh
mn007|and using the the outputs of these networks or the linear outputs or something like that.|s
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
me018|what about mel cepstrum?|qw
me006|oh um|s^bk.%--
me018|or is that|qy.%--
me018|you don't include that because it's part of the base or something?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|well you do have a baseline system that's that's mel cepstra.|s^bu
fn002|yeah databases.|s^aa
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|so|fh
fn002|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn007|but uh|h
mn007|well|fh
mn007|not for the the a n n.|s^nd
mn007|i mean|%
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn007|so yeah.|fh
mn007|we could we could add m f c c also.|s^cs
me006|we could add|s^cs.%-
me013|probably should.|s^na
me013|i mean at least at least conceptually you know it doesn't meant you actually have to do it.|s^df
mn007|yeah.|b
fn002|yeah.|b
me013|but|fh
me013|conceptually it makes sense as a as a base line.|s^df
me018|it'd be an interesting test just to have just to do m f c c with the neural net.|s^cs
fn002|without the|s^2.%-
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
me018|and everything else the same.|s^e
me018|compare that with just m f c c without the the net.|s^cs^e
mn007|yeah.|b
fn002|uhhuh.|b
me006|i think i think dan did some of that.|s
me018|oh.|s^bk
me006|um in his previous aurora experiments.|fh|s^e
me006|and with the net it's it's wonderful.|s
me006|without the net it's just baseline.|s
me013|um i think o g i folks have been doing that too.|fg|s
me013|because i think that for a bunch of their experiments they used uh mel cepstra actually.|s^e
me006|yeah.|b
me006|yeah.|b
me013|um of course that's there and this is here and so on.|fh|s
me013|okay.|s^rt^tc
me006|okay.|s^bk
me006|um for the training corpus corpus um we have um the the digits from the various languages.|fh|s

me018|uh.|b
me018|i see.|s^bk
me006|yeah.|b
me013|and i think stephane was saying there's there's some broader material in the french also.|s^bu
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|we we could use|s.%--

me034|did the aurora people actually corrupt it themselves?|qy

me006|they they corrupted it um themselves.|s^na

me006|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me006|or|%-
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me006|so we can go ahead and corrupt other things.|s^cs
me013|i'm just curious carmen.|s

me006|within the training corporas um we're uh thinking about um training with noise.|s

me006|incorporating the same kinds of noises that um aurora is incorporating in their um in their training corpus.|s
me006|um i don't think we're given the uh the unseen noise conditions though.|fh|s^bu
me006|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|i think what they were saying was that um for this next test there's going to be some of the cases where they have the same type of noise as you were given before hand and some cases where you're not.|s^arp
me006|like|%
me006|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|so presumably that'll be part of the topic of analysis of the the test results is how well you do when it's matching noise and how well you do where it's not.|s
me006|right.|s^bk
me013|i think that's right.|s
me006|so i guess we can't train on on the the unseen noise conditions.|s^bu
me013|well not if it's not seen.|s^na
me006|right.|b
me006|if not if it's unseen.|s^bk^m
me013|yeah.|fh
me006|yeah.|b
me013|i mean it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something that's at least a little bit noisy it can it can help you out in other kinds of noise.|s
me013|even if it's not matching.|s^e
me013|just because there's some more variance that you've built into things.|s^df
me013|but but uh|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time.|s
me013|so okay so that's your training corpus.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and then your testing corpus?|qy^bu^d^rt
me006|um the testing corporas are um just um the same ones as aurora testing.|h|s
me006|and that includes um the english um italian finnish.|fh|s
fn002|finnish.|s^2
me006|uh we're going to get german.|fh|s^bu
me006|right?|qy^d^g
me006|at the final test will have german.|s^na
me013|well so|h
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|the final test on a guess is supposed to be german and danish.|s^bu^na
mn007|uh yeah.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me006|right.|s^aa
mn007|the|%--
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|the spanish perhaps.|s^cs
me006|spanish.|s^bk
mn007|we will have|%
me006|oh yeah.|s^bk
me006|we can we can test on spanish.|s^cs^na
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|but the the aurora spanish i mean.|s^cs
me006|oh yeah.|s^bk
me006|uhhuh.|s^bk
me013|oh there's a there's spanish testing in the aurora?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn007|uh not yet.|s^nd
mn007|but uh uh|fh
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|it's preparing.|s
mn007|they are preparing it.|s^m^na
mn007|and well|fh
fn002|they are preparing.|s
mn007|according to hynek it will be we will have this at the end of november.|s
mn007|or um|fh
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so uh|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
me013|something like seven things in each uh each column.|s^co
me013|so that's uh three hundred and forty three uh different systems that are going to be developed.|s
me013|there's three of you.|s
me013|uh|fh
me013|so that's|s.%-
me006|yeah one hundred each about.|s
me013|hundred and hundred and fourteen each.|s
me026|what what about noise conditions?|qw^rt
me013|what?|qw^br^rt
me026|don't we need to put in the column for noise conditions?|qy^rt
me013|are you just trying to be difficult?|qh^j^rt
me026|no.|s^ar
me026|i just don't understand.|s^df
me006|well|%--
me006|uh|fg
me013|i'm just kidding.|s^t3
me006|when when i put these testings on there i'm|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
me006|there's three three tests.|s
me006|um|fh
me006|type a type b and type c.|s^e
me006|and they're all they're all going to be tested um with one training of the h t k system.|s
me006|um there's a script that tests all three different types of noise conditions.|s
me006|test a is like a matched noise.|s^e
me006|test b is a is a slightly mismatched.|s^e
me006|and test c is a um mismatched channel.|s^e
me026|and do we do all our training on clean data?|qy^rt
me006|um|h
fn002|also we can clean that|s.%--
me006|no no.|s^ar^r
mn007|no.|s^ar
me006|we're we're going to be um training on the noise files that we do have.|s^df
me013|so|fg
me013|um|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so i guess the question is how long does it take to do a a training?|qw
me013|i mean it's not totally crazy.|s^df
me013|i mean these are a lot of these are built in things.|s
me013|and we know we have programs that compute p l p.|s^e
me013|we have m s g.|s^e
me013|we have j|s^e.%--
me013|you know a lot of these things will just kind of happen.|s
me013|won't take uh a huge amount of development.|s
me013|it's just trying it out.|s
me013|so we actually can do quite a few experiments.|s
me013|but how how long does it take do we think for one of these trainings?|qw
me006|uhhuh.|b
me006|that's a good question.|s^ba
me018|what about combinations of things?|qw^cs
me013|oh yeah.|s^bk
me013|that's right.|s^bk
me013|i mean because|s.%--
me013|so for instance i think the major advantage of m s g|s.%--
me006|oh.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me006|och!|s^fe
me013|good point.|s^ba
me013|major advantage of m s g i see that we've seen in the past is combined with p l p.|s
fn002|yeah.|s^bk^rt
me013|um|fh
me006|now this is turning into a four dimensional cube?|qy^bu^d^rt
me034|or you just add it to the features.|s^cs^nd
fn002|no.|s^ar
me018|well you just select multiple things on the one dimension.|s^nd
fn002|here.|s.%
me006|just|%
me006|oh yeah.|s^bk
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so i mean|fg
me013|you don't want to|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|let's see.|s^t1
me013|seven choose two would be uh twenty one different combinations.|s
me013|um|fh
me034|it's not a complete set of combinations though.|s^bu
me013|probably|%-
me034|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|what?|qw^br^rt
me034|it's not a complete set of combinations though.|s^bu^r
me006|no.|s^ar
me034|right?|qy^d^g^r^rt
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|i hope not.|s^nd
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|there's|%--
me006|that would be|qy^d.%-
me013|uh|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so p l p and m s g i think we definitely want to try.|s^co
me013|because we've had a lot of good experience with putting those together.|s^df
fn002|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|yeah.|fh
me018|when you do that you're increasing the size of the inputs to the net.|s^rt
me018|do you have to reduce the hidden layer or something?|qy
me013|well so|fg
me013|i mean|fh
me013|so it doesn't increase the number of trainings.|s
me018|no no.|s^ar
me018|i'm i'm just wondering about number of parameters in the net.|s^bu
me018|do you have to worry about keeping that the same?|qy^bu^rt
me018|or|qrr.%--
me013|uh i don't think so.|h|s^nd
me034|there's a computation limit though.|s^bu
me034|isn't there?|qy^g^rt
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|i mean it's just more|s.%--
me013|excuse me?|qw^br^d^rt
me034|isn't there like a limit on the computation load or latency or something like that for aurora task?|qy^bu^r^rt
me013|oh yeah.|s^bk
me013|we haven't talked about any of that at all.|s^bu
me013|have we?|qy^g^rt
me006|no.|s^ar
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|so there's not really a limit.|s^nd^rt
me013|what it is is that there's there's uh it's just penalty.|s^e
me013|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me013|that that if you're using uh a megabyte then they'll say that's very nice.|s^e
me013|but of course it will never go on a cheap cell phone.|s^e
me013|um|fh
me034|okay.|b
me013|and|fh
me013|uh i think the computation isn't so much of a problem.|s
me013|i think it's more the memory.|s
me013|uh and expensive cell phones expensive hand helds and so forth are going to have lots of memory.|s^e
me013|so it's just that uh these people see the the cheap cell phones as being still the biggest market.|s^e
me013|so|fh
me034|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|but yeah.|fg
me013|i was just realizing that actually it doesn't explode out.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|it's not really two to the seventh.|s
me013|but it's but but it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings.|s
me013|because these were all trained individually.|s^df
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|so|fh
me013|uh if you have all of these nets trained some place then uh you can combine their outputs and do the k l transformation and so forth.|s^cs
me013|and and uh|fh
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|so what it it blows out is the number of uh testings.|s
me013|and you know and the number of times you do that last part.|s
me013|but that last part i think is so has got to be pretty quick.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|uh|fh
me013|right.|fh
me013|i mean it's just running the data through.|s
me006|oh.|s^bk
me013|well you got to do the k l transformation.|s
me018|but what about a net that's trained on multiple languages though?|qw
mn007|eight|%-
me013|but|%-
me018|is that just separate nets for each language then combined?|qy^bu^rt
fn002|necessary to put in.|s
me018|or is that actually one net trained on?|qrr
mn007|uh probably one net.|s^na
me013|good question.|s^ba
mn007|well.|fh
mn007|uh|fh
me013|one would think one net.|s^na
mn007|so|fh
me013|but we've i don't think we've tested that.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|so in the broader training corpus we can we can use uh the three or a combination of of two two languages.|s^cs
fn002|database three.|s
me018|in one net.|s^2^bu
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so i guess the first thing is if if we know how much a how long a a training takes.|s
me013|if we can train up all these these combinations uh then we can start working on testing of them individually and in combination.|s^cs
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|because the putting them in combination i think is not as much computationally as the training of the nets in the first place.|s^df
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^g.%
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so you do have to compute the k l transformation.|s
me013|uh|fh
me013|which is a little bit.|s^e
me013|but it's not too much.|s^e
mn007|it's not too much.|s^m^na
mn007|no.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
me013|so it's|s.%--
mn007|but yeah.|fh
mn007|but there is the testing also which implies training uh the h t k models.|s
fn002|the the model.|s^2
mn007|and well|fh
fn002|the h t k model.|s^2
me013|uh right.|s^aa
mn007|it's|%-
me013|right.|s^aa^r
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|so if you do have lots of combinations it's|s.%--
mn007|but it's it's it's not so long.|s
mn007|it|%--
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|how long does it take for an uh h t k training?|qw
mn007|it's around six hours i think.|s
fn002|it depends on the|s.%-
mn007|for training and testing.|s^e
mn007|yeah.|fh
fn002|more than six hours.|s^nd
mn007|more.|s^bk^m
fn002|for the italian.|s^e
fn002|yes.|s^aa
fn002|maybe one day.|s
mn007|one day.|s^bk^m
me013|for h t k?|qy^bu^d^rt
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
me013|really?|qh^bk
fn002|well.|b
me013|running on what?|qw^d
fn002|uh m f c c.|s^rt
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|i'm sorry.|s^fa
me013|running on what machine?|qw^d
fn002|uh ravioli.|s
me013|uh|h
me013|i don't know what ravioli is.|s^no
me013|is it is it an ultra five?|qy^rt
me013|or is it a|qrr.%--
fn002|huh.|b
fn002|um who is that?|qw
me018|i don't know.|s^no
me006|i don't know.|s^no
fn002|i don't know.|s^no
me034|i don't know what a ravioli is.|s^no
fn002|i don't know.|s^no^r
me006|i don't know.|s^no
me034|we can check really quickly.|s^cs
mn007|yeah.|fg
me034|i guess.|s
mn007|i think it's not so long.|s
mn007|because well the t i digits test data is about uh many hours.|s
mn007|uh uh thirty hours of speech i think.|s^e
me013|it's a few hours.|s^2
mn007|something like that.|s
me034|huh.|b
me013|yeah right.|fg
mn007|and it|%--
mn007|well.|fh
me013|so|fg
me013|i mean|fg
me013|clearly there's no way we can even begin to do any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines.|s^cs
mn007|it's six hours.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|so we|s.%--
me013|i mean there's plenty of machines here.|s^df
me013|and they're they're often not in in a great great deal of use.|s^df
me013|so i mean i think it's it's key that that the that you look at uh you know what machines are fast what machines are used a lot.|s^co
me013|uh are we still using p make?|qy^bu^rt
me013|is that|qy.%-
me006|oh.|s^bk
me006|i don't know how how we would p make this though.|s^ng
me006|um|fh
me013|well you have a|s.%--
me013|i mean once you get the basic thing set up you have just all the uh all these combinations.|s
me006|yeah.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|it's let's say it's six hours or eight hours or something for the training of h t k.|s
me013|how long is it for training of of uh the neural net?|qw
me006|the neural net?|qy^bk^d^m^rt
me006|um|fh
mn007|i would say two days.|s
me018|depends on the corpuses right?|s^arp^bu|qy^d^g^rt
fn002|it depends.|s^arp
mn007|yeah.|b
me034|it also depends on the net.|s^na
fn002|depends on the corpus.|s^arp
me006|yeah.|b
me034|how big is the net?|qw^rt
fn002|for albayzin i trained on neural network.|s
fn002|uh was um one day also.|s
me013|uh|fg
me013|but on what machine?|qw^d
me006|on a spert board.|s
fn002|uh|h
fn002|i i think the neural net spert.|s
me006|you did a you did it on a spert board.|s^r
me013|okay.|fg
fn002|yes.|s^aa
me013|again we do have a bunch of spert boards.|s
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me013|and i think there's i think you folks are probably the ones using them right now.|s
me018|is it faster to do it on the spert?|qy^rt
me018|or|qrr.%--
me013|uh don't know.|h|s^no
me013|used to be.|s^aap
me006|it's it's still a little faster on the sperts.|s^na
me018|is it?|qh^bk^rt
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me006|yeah.|s^aa^r
me006|adam adam did some testing.|s^e
me006|or either adam or or dan did some testing.|s^e
me006|and they found that the spert board's still still faster.|s^e
me006|and the benefits is that you know you run out of spert and then you can do other things on your your computer.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me006|and you don't|s.%-
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so you could be|s.%--
me013|we have quite a few spert boards.|s
me013|you could set up uh you know ten different jobs or something to run on spert different spert boards.|s^cs
me013|and and have ten other jobs running on different computers.|s
me013|so it's got to take that sort of thing.|s
me013|or or we're not going to get through any significant number of these.|s
me006|yeah.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|so this is|s.%--
me013|yeah i mean|fg
me013|i kind of like this because what it|s.%--
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|what i like about it is|s.%--
me006|okay.|b
me013|we we we do have a problem.|s
me013|that we have very limited time.|s^e
me013|you know.|fh
me013|so with very limited time we actually have really quite a quite a bit of computational resource available.|s
me013|if you you know get a look across the institute and how little things are being used.|s^df
me013|and uh|fh
me013|on the other hand almost anything that really you know is is new where we're saying well let's look at like we were talking before about uh uh voiced-unvoiced-silence detection features and all those sort that's|s.%--
fn002|yeah.|b
me013|i think it's a great thing to go to.|s
me013|but if it's new then we have this development and and and learning process to to go through on top of just the the all the all the work.|s
me013|so i i i don't see how we'd do it.|s^nd
me013|so what i like about this is you basically have listed all the things that we already know how to do.|s
me013|and and all the kinds of data that we at this point already have.|s
fn002|yeah.|b
me013|and uh you're just saying let's look at the outer product of all of these things.|fh|s
me013|and see if we can calculate them.|s
me013|am i am i interpreting this correctly?|qy^bu^rt
me013|is this sort of what what you're thinking of doing in the short term?|qy^bu^rt
mn007|huh.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so so then i think it's just the the missing piece is that you need to uh you know you know talk to talk to uh chuck talk to uh adam.|s^co
me013|uh sort out about uh what's the best way to really you know attack this as a as a as a mass problem in terms of using many machines.|s^co
me013|uh|fh
me013|and uh then you know set it up in terms of scripts and so forth and uh in in kind some kind of structured way.|s^co
me013|uh|fh
me013|um and you know when we go to uh o g i next week uh we can then present to them you know what it is that we're doing.|s^co
me013|and uh we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently.|fh|s^co
me006|huh.|b
me013|that you know we're not we won't be contributing that much.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|and uh|fh
me013|then uh like we're there.|s
me034|how big are the nets you're using?|qw^rt
me006|um for the for nets trained on digits um we have been using uh four hundred order hidden units.|h|s^rt
me006|and um for the broader class nets we're we're going to increase that.|fh|s^cc
me006|because the um the digits nets only correspond to about twenty phonemes.|s^df
me034|uhhuh.|b
me006|so|fh
me013|broader class?|qw^bu^d^rt
me006|um the broader broader training corpus nets.|h|s
me006|like timit.|s^e
me006|um we're going to|fh|s.%-
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|it's not actually broader class.|s^ng
me013|it's actually finer class.|s^ng
me013|but you mean you mean more classes.|s
me006|right.|s^aa
me006|right.|b
me006|yeah.|b
me006|more classes.|s^bk^m
me006|right right.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
me006|more classes.|s^bk^m
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me006|that's what i mean.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me006|uhhuh.|b
me006|and|fh
me006|yeah.|b
me013|carmen did you do you have something else to add?|qy^rt
me013|we you haven't talked too much.|s^df
me013|and|fh
fn002|i begin to work with the italian database to nnn to with the front end and with the h t k program and the.|s
fn002|and i trained uh with the spanish two neural network with p l p and with lograsta p l p.|s
fn002|i don't know exactly what is better if if lograsta or j rasta.|s^no
me013|well um j rasta has the potential to do better.|h|s
me013|but it doesn't always.|s
me013|it's j rasta is more complicated.|s^e
me013|it's it's uh instead of doing rasta with a log you're doing rasta with a log like function that varies depending on a j parameter.|s^df
me013|uh which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is.|s^e
me013|so it's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in is dependent on how much noise there is.|s^df
fn002|huh huh.|b
me013|and so in j rasta you attempt to do that.|s
me013|it's a little complicated.|s
me013|because once you do that you end up in some funny domain.|s^df
me013|and you end up having to do a transformation afterwards.|s^df
me013|which requires some tables.|s^e
me013|and uh|fh
me013|so it's it's it's a little messier.|s
fn002|huh huh.|b
me013|uh there's more ways that it can go wrong.|s
me013|uh but if if if you're careful with it it can do better.|fh|s
fn002|it's a bit i'll do better.|s^m
me013|so it's|s.%--
me013|so|fh
fn002|um and i think to to to recognize the italian digits with the neural spanish neural network.|fg|s^cs
fn002|and also to train another neural network with the spanish digits.|s^cs
fn002|the database of spanish digits.|s^bsc
fn002|and i working that.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
fn002|but to prepare the the database are difficult.|s
fn002|was for me it was a difficult work last week with the labels.|s
fn002|because the the program with the label obtained that i have the albayzin is different to the label to train the neural network.|s^df
fn002|and that is another work that we must to do to to change.|s^cs
me013|i didn't understand.|s^br
fn002|uh for example albayzin database was labeled automatically with h t k.|s
fn002|it's not hand.|s^df
fn002|it's not labels by hand.|s^df
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|labeled.|s^bk
me013|i'm sorry.|s^fa
fn002|labels.|s^bk^m
me013|i have a i had a problem with the pronunciation.|s^df
fn002|i'm sorry.|s^fa
fn002|i'm sorry.|s^fa^r
fn002|the labels.|s^bk^m
fn002|i'm sorry.|s^fa
fn002|the labels.|s^bk^m
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so|fg
me013|okay.|fg
fn002|oh also that|%--
me013|so let's start over.|s^co
me013|so timit's hand labeled.|s^bs
fn002|yes.|s^aa
me013|and and you're saying about the spanish?|qw^br^d^rt
fn002|the spanish labels.|s
fn002|that was in different format.|s
me013|oh i see.|s^bk
fn002|that the format for the them the program to train the neural network.|s^e
fn002|i necessary to convert.|s
fn002|and|%--
fn002|well|fh
me018|so you're just having a problem converting the labels.|s^bs
fn002|it's it's|%-
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|but|%--
fn002|yes.|s^aa
fn002|because they have one program feacalc.|s^df
fn002|but no.|s^ar
fn002|labecut but don't doesn't uh include the h t k format to convert.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|and|fh
me034|huh.|b
fn002|i don't know what.|s^no
fn002|i ask even i ask to dan ellis what i can do that.|s
fn002|and they he say me that he doesn't any any any form to to do that.|s
fn002|and at the end i think that with labecut i can transfer to ascii format.|s^cc
fn002|and h t k is an ascii format.|s^e
fn002|and i do another uh one program to put ascii format of h t k to ascii format to exceed.|s^cc
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|and they used labcut to to pass.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|s^bk
fn002|actually that was complicated.|s
me013|so you|%-
fn002|but well i know how we can did that do that.|s
me013|sure.|s^bk
me013|so it's just usual kind of uh sometimes say housekeeping.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|to get these get these things sorted out.|s^e
fn002|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so it seems like there's there's some peculiarities of the uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out.|s
me013|and then um if if you work on getting the uh assembly lines together and then the the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line.|s
me013|and gradually can start you know start turning the crank more or less.|s
me013|and uh uh|fh
me013|we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at o g i.|s
me013|so i think that if|s.%--
me013|what's what's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way.|s^ba
me013|so that uh once these all of these you know mundane but real problems get sorted out we can just start turning the crank.|s^cs
fn002|uhhuh.|b
me013|and and push all of us through.|s^cs
me013|and then finally figure out what's best.|s^cs
me006|yeah.|b
me006|um|fg
me006|i i was thinking two things.|s
me006|uh the first thing was um|fh|s.%--
me006|we we actually had thought of this as sort of like um not not in stages but more along the the time axis.|s
me006|just kind of like one stream at a time.|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
me006|je-je-je-je-je check out the results.|s^e
me006|and and go that way.|s^e
me013|oh yeah yeah.|s^bk
me013|sure.|s^bk
me013|no i'm just saying i'm just thinking of it like loops.|fg|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|and so if you had three nested loops that you have a choice for this a choice for this and a choice for that.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me006|yeah.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|and you're going through them all.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|that that's what i meant.|s
me006|right.|s^aa
me006|right.|s^aa^r
me013|and uh the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do uh um concurrently on different machines different sperts and so forth uh and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth you can stand back from it and say okay if we look at all these combinations we're talking about and combinations of combinations and so forth you'll probably find you can't do it all.|fh|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me006|okay.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so then at that point uh we should sort out which ones do we throw away.|s^co
me013|which of the combinations across you know what are the most likely ones.|s^e
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|and|%--
me013|and uh|fh
me013|i still think we could do a lot of them.|s
me013|i mean it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something.|s^e
me013|but probably when you include all the combinations you're actually talking about a thousand of them or something.|s
me013|and that's probably more than we can do.|s^df
me013|uh|fh
me013|but a hundred is a lot.|s^bd
me013|and and uh um|fh
me006|okay.|b
me013|yeah.|fh
me006|yeah.|b
me006|and the the second thing was about scratch space.|s^rt^tc
me006|and i think you sent an email about um scratch space for for people to work on.|s
me006|and i know that uh stephane's working from an n t machine.|s
me006|so his his home directory exists somewhere else.|s
me013|his his stuff is somewhere else.|s^2
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|i mean my point|s.%--
me013|i i want to|s.%--
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|thanks for bring it back to that.|s^ft
me013|my i want to clarify my point about that that that chuck repeated in his note.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|we're over the next year or two we're going to be upgrading the networks in this place.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|but right now they're still all pretty much all ten megabit lines.|s
me013|and we have reached the this the machines are getting faster and faster.|s
me013|so it actually has reached the point where it's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|so you you don't especially in something with repetitive computation where you're going over it multiple times you do don't want to have the the data that you're working on distant from where it's being where the computation's being done if you can help it.|s^cs
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|now we are getting more disk for the central file server.|s
me013|which since it's not a computational server would seem to be a contradiction to what i just said.|s^e
me013|but the idea is that uh suppose you're working with uh this big bunch of multi multi lingual databases.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|you put them all in the central at the central file server.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|then when you're working with something and accessing it many times you copy the piece of it that you're working with over to some place that's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there.|s
me013|and then that way you you won't have the the network you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others.|s^df
me006|huh.|b
me013|that's the idea.|s
me013|so uh it's going to take us|fh|s.%--
me013|it may be too late for this uh precise crunch we're in now.|s
me013|but uh|fh
me013|we're|%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|it's going to take us a couple weeks at least to get the uh uh the amount of disk we're going to be getting we're actually going to get.|s
me013|uh i think four more uh thirty six gigabyte drives.|s^e
me013|and uh put them on another another disk rack|s.%--
me013|we ran out of space on the disk rack that we had.|s
me013|so we're getting another disk rack and four more drives to share between uh primarily between this project and the meetings meetings project.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|but uh|fh
me013|we've put another i guess there's another eighteen gigabytes that's that's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch.|s
me013|but uh|fh
me013|are you saying|qy.%--
me013|so i don't know where you're|s^no.%--
me013|stephane where you're doing your computations?|qw
me013|if so you're on n t machine.|s
me013|so you're using some external machine too.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|it|%--
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|well|fh
mn007|to|%--
mn007|it's nutmeg and mustard i think.|s^na
mn007|it uh|%--
me013|do you know these yet?|qy
mn007|i don't know what kind.|s^no
me018|nuh uh.|s^ar
me013|yeah okay.|s^bk
me013|uh|fg
me013|are these are these uh computational servers or something?|qy
me013|i'm i've been kind of out of it.|s^df
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|i think yeah.|s^aa
mn007|i think so.|s^na
mn007|huh.|b
me013|unfortunately these days my idea of running of doing computation is running a spread sheet.|s^j
me013|so|fh
mn007|huh.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|haven't been haven't been doing much computing personally.|s^df
me013|so|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so those are computational servers.|s
me013|so i guess the other question is what disk there space there is there on the computational servers.|s
me018|right.|b
me018|yeah i'm not sure what's available on|s^bk|s^no.%--
me018|is it|qy.%--
me018|you said nutmeg.|s^bs
me018|and what was the other one?|qw^bu^rt
mn007|mustard.|s^rt
me018|mustard.|s^bk^m
me018|okay.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me034|huh.|b
me013|well you're the you're the disk czar now.|s^j
me013|so|fh
me018|right right.|s^bk
me018|well i'll check on that.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah so basically uh chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where and so on.|s^bk|s
me013|and i'll be the one who says okay spend the money.|s
me013|which i mean|s^e.%--
me013|these days uh if you're talking about scratch space it doesn't increase the uh need for backup.|s
me013|and uh i think it's not that big a|fh|s.%--
me013|and the the disks themselves are not that expensive.|s^df
me013|right now it's|s^e.%--
me018|what you can do when you're on that machine is uh just go to the slash scratch directory and do a d f minus k.|s^cs
me018|and it'll tell you if there's space available.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|uh and if there is then uh|s.%--
me013|but wasn't it uh|qy^bu.%--
me013|i think dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash scratch.|s^ng
me013|it's more putting in x a or x b or|s^bu.%--
me018|well there's different there um there's|s.%--
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|right.|s^aa
me018|so there's the slash x whatever disks and then there's slash scratch.|s
me018|and both of those two kinds are not backed up.|s^e
me018|and if it's called slash scratch it means it's probably an internal disk to the machine.|s^e
me018|um|fh
me018|and so that's the kind of thing where like if um okay if you don't have an n t but you have a a a unix workstation and they attach an external disk it'll be called slash x something uh if it's not backed up.|s^e
me018|and it'll be slash d something if it is backed up.|s^e
me018|and if it's inside the machine on the desk it's called slash scratch.|s^e
me018|but the problem is if you ever get a new machine they take your machine away.|s
me018|it's easy to unhook the external disks.|s
me018|put them back on the new machine.|s
me018|but then your slash scratch is gone.|s
me018|so you don't want to put anything in slash scratch that you want to keep around for a long period of time.|s
me018|but if it's a copy of say some data that's on a server you can put it on slash scratch.|s
me018|because um first of all it's not backed up.|s^df
me018|and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine.|s^df
me018|because you just recopy it to slash scratch.|s^df
me018|so that's why i was saying you could check slash scratch on those on on um mustard and and nutmeg to see if if there's space that you could use there.|s^df
me013|i see.|s^bk
me018|you could also use slash x whatever disks on mustard and nutmeg.|s^cs
mn007|yeah yeah.|b
me018|um|fh
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|and we do have|s.%--
me018|i mean|%--
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|so so you|%--
me018|yeah it's better to have things local if you're going to run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network.|s^cs
me013|right.|s^aa
me013|so so especially if you're right if you're if you're taking some piece of the training corpus which usually resides in where chuck is putting it all on the on the uh file server uh then yeah it's fine if it's not backed up.|s
me013|because if it gets wiped out or something i mean it is backed up on the other disk.|s^df
me013|so|fh
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|b
me018|yeah so one of the things that i need to i've started looking at|fg|s.%--
me018|uh is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff?|qy^rt
me013|sure.|s^aa
me018|i've started looking at um disk space.|s
me018|dan david um put a new um drive onto abbott that's an x disk.|s
me018|which means it's not backed up.|s^e
me018|so|fh
me018|um i've been going through and copying data that is you know some kind of corpus stuff usually that that we've got on a c d rom or something onto that new disk to free up space on other disks.|fh|s
me018|and um so far um i've copied a couple of carmen's um databases over there.|s
me018|we haven't deleted them off of the slash d c disk that they're on right now in abbott.|s
me018|um|fh
me018|uh but we i would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto um this new disk also.|s^cs
mn007|yeah okay.|s^aa
me018|there's there's a lot more space there.|s^df
me018|and it'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things.|s^df
me018|so anything that that you don't need backed up we can put on this new disk.|s
me018|um but if it's experiments and you're creating files and things that you're going to need you probably want to have those on a disk that's backed up just in case something goes wrong.|s^cs
me018|so|fh
me018|um|fh
me018|so far i've i've copied a couple of things.|s
me018|but i haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet.|s
me018|um|fh
me018|and i haven't looked at the any of the aurora stuff.|s
me018|except for the spanish.|s^e
me018|so i i guess i'll need to get together with you and see what data we can move onto the new disk.|s^cs
mn007|yeah okay.|s^aa
me013|um|fg
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|i i just|s.%--
me013|another question occurred to me is is what were you folks planning to do about normalization?|qw
mn007|um|h
mn007|well we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments.|s
mn007|um|fh
me013|this being?|qw^bu^d
mn007|so|fh
mn007|but|%--
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|so that this could be another dimension.|s
mn007|but we think perhaps we can use the the best uh um uh normalization scheme as o g i is using.|s^rt
mn007|so with parameters that they use there.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|i think that's a good idea.|s^ba^na
me013|i mean it's we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is.|s^df
me013|so probably if we sort of take their|s.%--
mn007|yeah yeah yeah.|b
me013|probably the online line normalization.|s
me013|because then it it's if we do anything else we're going to end up having to do online normalization too.|s^df
me013|so we may as well just do online normalization.|s^cs
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so|fh
me013|so that it's plausible for the final thing.|s
me013|good.|s^ba
me013|um|fg
me013|so i guess|%--
me013|yeah the other topic|s.%--
me013|i maybe we're already there or almost there is goals for the for next week's meeting.|s
me013|uh it seems to me that we want to do is flush out what you put on the board here.|s
me013|uh|fh
me013|you know maybe have it be somewhat visual little bit.|s^cs
me006|okay.|s^bk
me006|like a like a slide?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|uh|fh
me013|so we can say what we're doing.|s^df
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|and um also if you have sorted out um this information about how long roughly how long it takes to do on what and you know what we can how many of these trainings uh uh and testings and so forth that we can realistically do uh then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to to actually settle on which of them we're going to do.|s^cs
me013|and uh when we come back we can charge in and do it.|fh|s^co
me013|um|fh
me013|anything else that|qo.%--
me013|actually started out this this field trip started off with with uh stephane talking to hynek.|s
me013|so you may have you may have had other goals uh for going up.|s
me013|and anything else you can think of would be we should think about accomplishing?|qo^d^rt
me013|i mean i'm just saying this because maybe there's things we need to do in preparation.|s^df
mn007|oh i think basically this is this is|s.%--
mn007|uh yeah.|fh
me013|okay.|b
me013|okay.|b
me013|uh|fg
me013|all right.|fg
me013|and uh and the other the the last topic i had here was um uh dave's fine offer to to uh do something on this.|s^t^tc
me013|i mean he's doing he's working on other things.|s^df
me013|but to to do something on this project.|s^e
me013|so the question is where where could we uh uh most use dave's help?|qw
mn007|um|h
mn007|yeah.|h
mn007|i was thinking perhaps if um additionally to all these experiments which is not really research.|s
mn007|well i mean it's uh running programs.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|and um trying to have a closer look at the perhaps the um speech uh noise detection or uh voiced-sound-unvoiced-sound detection.|s^cs
mn007|and which could be important in for noise noise.|s^df
me018|i think that would be a i think that's a big big deal.|s
me018|because the you know the thing that sunil was talking about uh with the labels uh labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff.|s^df
me018|the that that really throws things off.|s^df
me018|you know having the noise all of a sudden your your um speech detector.|s
me018|i mean the the um|s^bsc.%--
me018|what was it?|qw
me013|um.|b
me018|what was happening with his thing?|qw^rt
me018|he was running through these models very quickly.|s
me018|he was getting lots of uh uh insertions is what it was.|s
me018|in his recognitions.|s^e
me013|the only problem|s^nd.%--
me013|i mean maybe that's the right thing.|s^am
me013|the only problem i have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it'd be a good thing to do.|s^nd
me013|um i i think that|fh|s.%--
me013|let's fall back to that.|s^co
me013|but i think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there's something that uh an an additional|s^co.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|that's a good thing you remove the mike.|s^ba^t3
me013|go ahead.|s^co^t3
me013|good.|s^ba^t3
me013|uh|fh
me013|uh|fh
me013|what an additional clever person could help with when we're really in a crunch for time.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|because dave's going to be around for a long time.|s^df
me013|all right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
fn002|yeah.|b
me013|he's he's going to be here for years.|s^e
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|and so um|fh
me013|over years if he's if he's interested in you know voiced-unvoiced-silence he could do a lot.|s
me013|but if there if in fact there's something else that he could be doing would help us when we're we're sort of uh strapped for time.|s
me013|we have we we've you know only uh another another month or two to you know with the holidays in the middle of it um to to get a lot done.|s
me013|if we can think of something some piece of this that's going to be|s^cs.%--
me013|the very fact that it is sort of just work and and it's running programs and so forth is exactly why it's possible that it some piece of could be handed to someone to do.|s^df
me013|because it's not|s^df.%--
me013|uh yeah.|fh
me013|so that that's the question.|s
me013|and we don't have to solve it right this second.|s
me013|but if we could think of some some piece that's that's well defined that he could help with.|s^cs
me013|he's expressing a willingness to do that.|s^df
me018|what about training up a um a multilingual net?|qo^cs^rt
me013|uh|fh
fn002|yes.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|b
fn002|maybe to huh put together the the label the labels between timit and spanish or something like that.|s^cs^na
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|so defining the superset.|s^cs
fn002|yes.|b
mn007|and uh joining the data.|s^cs
mn007|and huh|fh
fn002|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|fh
me013|uh|h
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|that's something that needs to be done.|s^na
me013|in any event.|s^e
fn002|yeah.|b
me013|so what we were just saying is that that um i was arguing for if possible coming up with something that that really was development and wasn't research.|s
me013|because we we're we have a time crunch.|s^df
me013|and so uh if there's something that would would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece then we should think of that first.|s^cs
me013|see the thing with voiced-unvoiced-silence is i really think that that it's to do to do a a a a poor job is is pretty quick.|s
me013|uh|fh
me013|or you know a so so job.|s^e
me013|you can you can you can throw in a couple|s.%--
me013|we know what what kinds of features help with it.|s
fn002|huh.|b
me013|you can throw something in.|s
me013|you can do pretty well.|s
me013|but i remember in fact when you were working on that.|s
me013|and you worked on for few months as i recall.|s
me013|and you got to say ninety three percent.|s
me013|and getting to ninety four really really hard.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|another year.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|so|fg
me013|um|fg
me013|and the other tricky thing is since we are|s.%--
me013|uh even though we're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size and and computational complexity uh clearly there's some limitation to it.|s
me013|so if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector say if we if we're trying to incorporate pitch information or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity or something this is another whole thing.|s
me013|take a while to develop.|s
me013|anyway it's a very very interesting topic.|s
me013|i mean one i think one of the a lot of people would say and i think dan would also uh that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we we really do throw away all the harmonicity information.|s
me013|uh we try to get spectral envelopes.|fh|s
me013|reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail.|s^e
me013|but the harmonic detail does tell you something.|s^df
me013|like the fact that there is harmonic detail is is real important.|s^df
me013|so|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|so uh|fh
me013|so i think|s.%--
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so that so the the other suggestion just came up was well what about having him work on the uh multi lingual superset kind of thing.|s^bs
me013|uh coming up with that and then you know training it training a net on that say um from from uh from timit or something.|fh|s^bs
me013|is that or uh for multiple databases.|s
me013|what what would you what would you think it would|qw.%--
me013|what would this task consist of?|qw
mn007|yeah it would consist in uh|s^bk|s.%--
mn007|well.|fh
mn007|um creating the the superset.|fh|s^rt
mn007|and uh modifying the labels for matching the superset.|s^rt
mn007|uh|fh
me013|uh creating a superset from looking at the multiple languages.|fg|s^bu
mn007|well creating the mappings actually.|s
me013|and then creating changing labels on timit?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|or on or on multiple language multiple languages?|qrr^bu^d
fn002|no.|s^ar
mn007|yeah yeah.|s^aa
fn002|the multiple language.|s^nd
mn007|with the three languages.|s^na
fn002|maybe for the other language.|s^cs
fn002|because timit have more phone.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
me013|uh.|fg
me018|so you'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset.|s
fn002|yeah.|b
mn007|from each language to the superset.|s^2
fn002|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|yeah.|b
me006|there's|%--
me006|um|fh
me006|carmen was talking about this sampa thing.|s^rt
me006|and it's um it's an effort by linguists to come up with um a machine readable i p a um sort of thing.|s^e
me006|right.|fh
me006|and um they they have a web site that stephane was showing us that has um has all the english phonemes and their sampa correspondent um phoneme.|fh|s^e
me013|yeah.|b
me006|and then um they have spanish.|s^e
me006|they have german.|s^e
me006|they have all all sorts of languages um mapping mapping to the sampa phonemes.|s^e
me006|which|%-
fn002|yeah.|s^bk
fn002|the the transcription though for albayzin is the transcription are of sampa the same uh how you say symbol that sampa appear.|s
me034|sampa?|qy^bu^d^rt^t3
me034|what does sampa mean?|qw^bu^t3
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|huh.|b
fn002|but i don't know if timit how is timit.|s^no
me034|so i mean|s.%-
me013|what|%-
me034|i'm sorry.|s^fa
me013|go ahead.|s^co
me034|i was going to say does that mean i p a is not really international?|qy^rt
me006|no it's it's saying|s^ar|s.%-
me018|it uses special diacritics and stuff which you can't do with ascii characters.|s^ng
me006|can't print on ascii.|s^nd
fn002|yeah.|b
me034|oh i see.|s^bk
me018|so the sampa's just mapping those.|s
me034|got it.|s^bk
me013|what uh|qw.%--
me013|has o g i done anything about this issue?|qy^rt
me013|do they have do they have any kind of superset that they already have?|qy^rt
mn007|i don't think so.|s^nd
mn007|well they they they're going actually the the other way defining phoneme clusters apparently.|s^df
mn007|well|fh
me013|aha.|s^bk
me013|that's right.|s^aa
me013|uh and that's an interesting way to go too.|s
me018|so they just throw the speech from all different languages together.|s^bu
me018|then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn007|i think they've not done it uh doing uh multiple language yet.|s^nd
mn007|but what they did is to training uh english nets with all the phonemes.|s^df
mn007|and then training it in english nets with uh kind of seventeen i think it was seventeen uh broad classes.|s^df
me018|automatically derived.|s^2
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^bk^rt
me018|automatically derived broad classes or|qr^d.%-
mn007|yeah i think so.|s^aa|s^na
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|and yeah.|fh
mn007|and the result was that apparently when testing on cross language it was better.|s
mn007|i think so.|s^t1
mn007|but hynek didn't add didn't have all the results when he showed me that.|s^df
mn007|so well.|fh
mn007|but|%-
me013|so that does make an interesting question though.|s
me013|is there's some way that we should tie into that with this.|s
me013|um.|fh
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|i mean if if in fact that is a better thing to do should we leverage that rather than doing um our own?|qy
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|so if if if they|s.%--
me013|i mean we have we have the the trainings with our own categories.|s
me013|and now we're saying well how do we handle cross language.|s
me013|and one way is to come up with a superset.|s^cs
me013|but they are they're trying coming up with clustered.|s
me013|and do we think there's something wrong with that?|qy
mn007|i think that there's something wrong|s^na.%--
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn007|well because|s.%--
me013|what|%-
mn007|well for the moment we are testing on digits.|s^df
mn007|and perhaps using broad phoneme classes.|s^df
mn007|it's it's okay for classifying the digits.|s^df
mn007|but as soon as you will have more words.|s^df
mn007|well words can differ with only a single phoneme and which could be the same uh class.|s^df
mn007|well.|fh
me013|i see.|s^bk
mn007|so|fh
me013|right.|s^bk
me013|although you are not using this for the|s^bu.%--
mn007|so i'm offering|s.%-
me013|you're using this for the feature generation now.|s^bu
me013|not the|s^bu.%--
mn007|yeah but you will ask the net to put one for the phoneme class.|s^aa|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|and so.|fh
me013|yeah.|b
me018|so you're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn007|well.|fh
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|yeah.|s^aa^r
mn007|huh.|b
me034|fact most confusions are within the phone phone classes right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
me034|i think uh larry was saying like obstruents are only confused with other obstruents et cetera et cetera.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
me018|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|this is another|s^na.%--
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|another point.|s^na
me013|yeah.|b
me006|so so maybe we could look at articulatory type stuff.|s^bu
me013|but that's what i thought they were going to|s.%--
me006|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|did they not do that?|qy^rt
me013|or|qrr.%--
mn007|i don't think so.|s^na
mn007|well.|fh
mn007|they were talking about perhaps.|s
me013|so|fg
mn007|but they|%--
mn007|i|%-
me013|they're talking about it.|s^bk
me013|but that's sort of a question whether they did.|s^nd
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|because that's that's the other route to go.|s
me013|instead of this you know|s.%--
me006|uhhuh.|b
me006|superclass.|s^2
me013|instead of the the the the superclass thing.|s^m^na
me013|which is to take|s^e.%--
me013|so suppose you don't really mark|s.%--
me013|to really mark articulatory features you really want to look at the acoustics and and see where everything is.|s
me013|and we're not going to do that.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|uh the second class way of doing it is to look at the uh phones that are labeled.|fh|s
me013|and translate them into acoustic uh articulatory uh uh features.|s
me013|so it won't really be right.|s
me013|you won't really have these overlapping things and so forth.|s^e
me018|so the targets of the net are these|qy^bu.%--
me013|but|fh
me013|articulatory feature.|s^2
me018|articulatory features?|qy^bu^d^m^na
me013|right.|s^aa
me018|but that implies that you can have more than one on at a time?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|that's right.|s^aa
me018|uh.|fh
me013|you either do that or you have multiple nets.|s^df
me018|okay.|fh
me018|i see.|s^bk
me013|uh|fh
me013|and um|fh
me013|i don't know if our software this if the versions of the quicknet that we're using allows for that.|s^bu^no^rt
me013|do you know?|qy^rt
me006|allows for?|qw^br^d^rt
me013|multiple targets being one.|s
me006|oh.|s^bk
me006|um|fh
me006|we have gotten soft targets to to work.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so that that'll work.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me006|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so um|fg
me013|that's another thing that could be done.|s
me013|is that we could we could uh just translate instead of translating to a superset just translate to articulatory features some set of articulatory features and train them with that.|s^cs^e
me034|um|fg
me013|now the fact even though it's a smaller number it's still fine.|s^df
me013|because you have the the uh combinations.|s^df
me013|so in fact it has every you know it had has has every distinction in it that you would have the other way.|s^e
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|but it should go across languages better.|s
me018|we could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too.|s^cs
me018|we could i don't know if you had uh the phone labels you could replace them by their articulatory features.|s^cs^e
me018|and then feed in a vector with those uh things turned on based on what they're supposed to be for each phone.|s^cs^e
me018|to see if it if you get a big win.|s^e
me018|do you know what i'm saying?|qy^f^rt
me013|no.|s^ar
me018|so|h
me018|um|fh
me018|i mean if your net is going to be outputting uh a vector of basically of|s^df.%--
me018|well it's going to have probabilities.|s^e
me018|but let's say that they were ones and zeros.|s
me018|then and you know for each|s.%--
me018|um|fh
me018|i don't know if you know this for your testing data.|s^no
me018|but if you know for your test data you know what the string of phones is and and you have them aligned then you can just instead of going through the net just create the vector for each phone and feed that in.|s^df
me018|to see if that data helps.|s^e
me018|uh uh what made me think about this is i was talking with hynek and he said that there was a guy at a t and t who spent eighteen months working on a single feature.|s
me018|and because they had done some cheating experiments|s^e.%-
me013|this was the guy that we were just talking that we saw on campus.|s
me013|so this was larry saul who did this did this.|s^e
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|he used sonorants.|s^e
me018|right.|s^aa
me018|okay.|s^bk
me013|was what he was doing.|s^e
me018|right.|b
me013|yeah.|fh
me018|and they they had done a cheating experiment or something right?|s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
me013|he he he didn't mention that part.|s^ng
me018|and determined that|s.%-
me013|but|fh
me018|well hynek said that that i guess before they had him work on this they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right it dramatically improved the result.|s^df
me013|i see.|s^bk
me013|okay.|b
me018|so i was thinking you know it made me think about this.|s^df
me018|that if it'd be an interesting experiment just to see you know if you did get all of those right.|s^e
me013|should be.|s^na
me013|because if you get all of them in there that defines all of the phones.|s^df
me013|so that's that's equivalent to saying that you've got got all the phones right.|s^e
me018|right.|b
me013|so if that doesn't help there's|s^cs.%--
me018|yeah.|b
me013|although yeah it would be make an interesting cheating experiment.|s^ba
me013|because we are using it in this funny way.|s^df
me013|where we're converting it into features.|s^e
me018|yeah.|b
me018|and then you also don't know what error they've got on the h t k side.|s
me018|you know?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|yeah.|b
me018|it sort of gives you your the best you could hope for kind of.|s
me006|huh.|b
me006|huh.|b
me006|i see.|s^bk.x
me034|the soft training of the nets still requires the vector to sum to one though.|s^bu
me006|to sum up to one.|s^m
me034|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me034|so you can't really feed it like two articulatory features that are on at the same time with ones.|s
me034|because it'll kind of normalize them down to one half or something like that for instance.|s^df
mn007|but perhaps you have the choice of the final|s.%--
me006|right.|b
me006|nonlinearity?|qy^2^d^rt
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|nonlinearity.|s^m^na
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me006|um|h
mn007|is it always softmax?|qy^bu^rt
me006|it's|s.%-
mn007|or|qrr.%--
me006|no.|s^ar
me006|it's actually sigmoid x.|s^nd
mn007|yeah.|b
me006|for the|s^e.%--
mn007|so if you choose sigmoid it's it's okay?|qy^bu^d
me006|you|%--
me013|did we just run out of disk?|qy^rt
me006|um|h
me006|i think i think apparently the uh|s.%--
me013|or|qrr.%--
me034|why don't you just choose linear?|qw^cs
me006|what's that?|qw^br^rt
me034|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me034|linear outputs?|qy^cs^d^rt
me006|linear outputs?|qw^br^rt
me034|isn't that what you'll want?|qy
me006|um|h
me034|if you're going to do a k l transform on it.|s^e
me006|right right.|s^bk
me006|right.|s^bk
me006|but during the training we would train on sigmoid x.|s
me034|oh you|%-
me034|yeah.|b
me006|and then at the end just chop off the final nonlinearity.|s
me034|huh.|b
me013|so we're we're we're off the air?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|or|qrr.%--
me013|about to be off the air.|s^aap
me013|we're going?|z
me013|okay.|z
me006|okay.|z
me013|close your door on door on the way out?|z
me006|thanks.|z
me013|thanks.|z
me006|oh.|z
me013|yeah.|z
me013|probably want to get this other door too.|z
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so|fh
me013|um what are we talking about today?|fh|qw^rt^t
mn007|uh well first there are perhaps these uh meeting recorder digits that we tested.|s^t
me013|oh yeah that was kind of uh interesting.|s^bk|s
mn007|so|fh
me013|the both the uh the s r i system and the|s.%--
mn007|um|b
me013|and for one thing that that sure shows the difference between having a lot of uh training data or not.|s
mn007|of data?|qy^2^d
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|uh the uh the best kind of number we have on the english uh on near microphone only is is uh three or four percent.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and uh it's significantly better than that using fairly simple front ends on on the uh uh with the s r i system.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i i think that the|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|but that's that's using uh a a pretty huge amount of data.|s
me013|mostly not digits of course.|s
me013|but but then again|s.%--
me013|well yeah.|fg
me013|in fact mostly not digits for the actual training the h m m's whereas uh in this case we're just using digits for training the h m m's.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|right.|b
me013|did anybody mention about whether the the s r i system is a is is doing the digits um the as a word model or as uh a sub phone states?|qr
mn007|i guess it's it's uh allophone models.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|so well|fh
me013|probably.|s^aap
me013|huh?|qy^d^g
mn007|yeah i think so.|s^aa|s^na
mn007|because it's their very huge their huge system.|s^df
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|and|fh
mn007|but|fg
mn007|so there is one difference.|s
mn007|well the s r i system the result for the s r i system that are represented here are with adaptation.|s
mn007|so there is|s.%--
mn007|it's their complete system and including online uh unsupervised adaptation.|s
me013|that's true.|s^aa
mn007|and if you don't use adaptation the error rate is around fifty percent worse i think if i remember.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|it's it's that much huh?|s^bu|qy^d^g
mn007|it's|%--
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|it's quite significant.|s^na
mn007|yeah.|fh
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|still.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but but uh what what i think i'd be interested to do given that is that we we should uh take|s^cs.%--
me013|i guess that somebody's going to do this.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^g
me013|is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the s r i system.|s^cs
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|we can do something like that.|s^na
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|yeah because|s.%-
mn007|but|%--
mn007|but i guess the main point is the data because|s.%--
mn007|uh i am not sure.|s^no
mn007|our back end is is fairly simple.|s
mn007|but until now well the attempts to improve it or have|s.%--
mn007|uh well i mean uh what chuck tried to to to do|s.%-
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|but he's doing it with the same data right?|s|qy^d^g
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|i mean so to so there's there's there's two things being affected.|s
mn007|so it's|%-
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|i mean one is that that you know there's something simple that's wrong with the back end.|s
me013|we've been playing a number of states.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh i i don't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of gaussians yet.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but but uh|fh
me013|uh you know.|fh
me013|but yeah so far he hadn't gotten any big improvement.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but that's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small.|s^df
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|huh.|b
me013|and um|fh
mn007|so yeah we could retrain some of these tandem on on huge|s^cs.%-
me013|well you could do that but i'm saying even with it not with that part not retrained.|s^na|s^ng
mn007|uh yeah.|s^bk
me013|just just using having the h m m's much better h m m's.|s
mn007|just|%-
mn007|for the h m m models.|s^2
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|um but just train those h m m's using different features.|fh|s^co
me013|the features coming from our aurora stuff.|s^e
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|but what would be interesting to see also is what what|s^cs.%--
mn007|perhaps it's not related the amount of data but the um recording conditions.|s^cs
mn007|i don't know.|fh
mn007|because it's probably not a problem of noise because our features are supposed to be robust to noise.|s
mn007|it's not a problem of channel because there is um normalization with respect to the channel.|s
me013|well yeah.|b
mn007|so|fh
me013|i i i'm sorry.|s^fa
me013|what what is the problem that you're trying to explain?|qw
mn007|the the fact that the result with the tandem and aurora system are uh so much worse.|s
me013|that the|%-
me013|oh.|b
me013|so much worse?|qy^2^cs^d^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|oh.|fg
me013|i uh but i'm i'm almost certain that it it i mean that it has to do with the um amount of training data.|s
mn007|it|%-
me013|it it's it's orders of magnitude off.|s
mn007|yeah but|fg
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah but we train only on digits and it's it's a digit task.|s^bk|s^df
mn007|so|%--
mn007|well|fh
me013|but but having a huge|s.%--
mn007|it|%-
me013|if if you look at what commercial places do they use a huge amount of data.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|all right.|b
me013|this is a modest amount of data.|s^ng
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i mean ordinarily you would say well given that you have enough occurrences of the digits you can just train with digits rather than with you know|fh|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but the thing is if you have a huge|s.%--
me013|in other words do word models|s.%--
me013|but if you have a huge amount of data then you're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones.|s
mn007|right.|b
mn007|huh.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|and that's just a huge amount of training for it.|s
me013|so it's um i i think it has to be that because as you say this is you know this is near microphone.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|it's really pretty clean data.|s^rt
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|now some of it could be the fact that|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|let's see in the in these multi train things did we include noisy data in the training?|qy^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|i mean that could be hurting us actually for the clean case.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|well actually we see that the clean train for the aurora proposals are are better than the multi train.|s^nd
me013|it is if|%-
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|because this is clean data.|s^na
me013|and so that's not too surprising.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but um uh|fh
me013|so|fh
mn007|well i guess what i meant is that|s.%--
mn007|well let's say if we if we add enough data to train on the um on the meeting recorder digits i guess we could have better results than this.|fh|s^cs
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|and|%--
mn007|what i meant is that perhaps we can learn something uh from this.|s
mn007|what's what's wrong uh what what is different between t i digits and these digits.|s
mn007|and|fh
me013|what kind of numbers are we getting on t i digits?|qw
mn007|it's point eight percent.|s
mn007|so|fh
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|i see.|s^bk
mn007|fourier.|s
me013|so in the actual t i digits database we're getting point eight percent.|s^bu
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|and here we're getting three or four three.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|let's see three for this?|qy^d
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|sure but i mean|s^bk|s.%--
me013|um point eight percent is something like double uh or triple what people have gotten who've worked very hard at doing that.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and and also as you point out there's adaptation in these numbers also.|s
mn007|huh.|b
me013|so if you you know put the take the adaptation off then it for the english near you get something like two percent.|s^cs
me013|and here you had you know something like three point four.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and i could easily see that difference coming from this huge amount of data that it was trained on.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so it's|%--
me013|you know i don't think there's anything magical here.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|it's you know we used a simple h t k system with a modest amount of data.|s^bs
me013|and this is a a you know modern uh system.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|uh has has a lot of nice points to it.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|so i mean the h t k is an older h t k even.|fh|s
me013|so|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah it it's not that surprising.|s
me013|but to me it just it just meant a practical point that um if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should uh|s.%--
me013|because we've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that's that's uh uh it seems like too large a number.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and uh uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously.|fh|s
me013|um|fh
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|so the three point four percent for this uh is is|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|so why is it|qw.%--
me013|it's an interesting question though still.|s
me013|why is why is it three point four percent for the the digits recorded in this environment as opposed to the uh point eight percent for for for the original t i digits database?|qw
me013|um|fh
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|that's that's my point.|s^na
me013|given given the same|%-
mn007|i i i don't i|%-
me013|yeah so ignore ignoring the the the s r i system for a moment.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|just looking at the t i the uh tandem system.|s
me013|if we're getting point eight percent which yes it's high.|s
me013|it's you know it it's not awfully high.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but it's you know it's it's high.|s
me013|um why is it uh four times as high or more?|fh|qw
mn007|yeah i guess.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|i mean there's even though it's close miked there's still there really is background noise.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|um and uh i suspect when the t i digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|it was not i mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all.|s
mn007|well.|%
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|and acoustically it's it's|s.%--
mn007|i listened.|s
mn007|it's quite different.|s
mn007|t i digit is it's very very clean and it's like studio recording.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|whereas these meeting recorder digits sometimes you have breath noise.|s
mn007|and|%--
mn007|huh.|b
me013|right.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|so i think they were|s.%-
mn007|it's not controlled at all i mean.|s
me013|bless you.|s^t3
me006|thanks.|s^ft^t3
me013|i yeah i think it's it's|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so yes.|fg
mn007|but|%
me013|it's i think it's it's the indication it's harder.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|uh yeah and again you know that's true either way.|fh|s
me013|i mean so take a look at the uh um the s r i results.|s
me013|i mean they're much much better.|s
me013|but still you're getting something like one point three percent for uh things that are same data as in t t i digits the same same text.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh and uh i'm sure the same same system would would get you know point point three or point four or something on the actual t i digits.|fh|s
me013|so this i think on both systems the these digits are showing up as harder.|s
mn007|huh.|b
me013|um|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|which i find sort of interesting cause i think this is closer to|s.%--
me013|uh i mean it's still read.|fh|s
me013|but i still think it's much closer to to what what people actually face um when they're they're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone.|s
me013|i mean i don't think uh|s.%--
me013|i mean i'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers.|s
me013|but i don't think that uh the uh the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their digits.|s
me013|i'm i'm i'm sure they get|s.%--
me013|uh i mean for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh uh middle america accents and|fh|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|it's a we it's it's it's u s.|s
me013|it has has many people who sound in many different ways.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|i mean.|fh
me013|okay.|fg
me013|that was that topic.|s^tc
me013|what else we got?|qw^t^tc
mn007|um|h
me013|did we end up giving up on on any eurospeech submissions?|qy
mn007|but|%
me013|or|qrr.%--
me013|i know thilo and dan ellis are are submitting something.|s
me013|but uh|fh
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|i i guess the only thing with these the meeting recorder and well|s.%--
mn007|so i think yeah i think we basically gave up.|s
me013|um now actually for the for the uh|s.%--
me013|we do have stuff for aurora right?|s|qy^d^g
me013|because because we have an extra month or something.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|yeah.|s^aa.x
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|so|fg
mn007|yeah for sure we will do something for the special session.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|b
me013|well that's fine.|s
me013|so so so we have a couple a couple little things on meeting recorder.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and we have we don't we don't have to flood it with papers.|s
me013|we're not trying to prove anything to anybody.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|that's fine.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|anything else?|qo^d^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|well so|h
mn007|perhaps the point is that we've been working on is|s.%--
mn007|yeah we have put the um the good v a d in the system.|s
mn007|and it really makes a huge difference.|s
mn007|um|fh
mn007|so|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|i think yeah this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not not the best.|s^rt
mn007|because with the new v a d it's very the results are similar to the france telecom results and perhaps even better sometimes.|s
me013|huh.|b
me006|huh.|b
mn007|um so there is this point.|fh|s^rt
mn007|uh the problem is that it's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it.|s
mn007|and um|fh
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|because it it|s.%--
mn007|well this v a d|s.%--
mn007|uh either some delay|s.%--
mn007|and we if we put it on the server side it doesn't work.|s
mn007|because on the server side features you already have l d a applied from the from the terminal side.|s^e
mn007|and so you accumulate the delay.|s
mn007|so the v a d should be before the l d a.|s
mn007|which means perhaps on the terminal side.|s
mn007|and then smaller and|s.%--
me013|so where did this good v a d come from?|qw^rt
mn007|so|fh
mn007|it's um from o g i.|s
mn007|so it's the network trained it's the network with the huge amounts on hidden of hidden units.|s
mn007|and um nine input frames compared to the v a d that was in the proposal which has a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs.|fh|s
me013|this is the one they had originally?|qy^bu^d
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|yeah but they had to get rid of it because of the space.|s^bk|s
me013|didn't they?|qy^g
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|so|fh
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|but the assumption is that we will be able to make a v a d that's small and that works fine.|s
mn007|and so we can|s.%-
me013|well so that's a problem.|s^ng
me013|yeah.|fh
mn007|yeah but|fg
me013|but the other thing is uh to use a different v a d entirely.|s^cs
me013|i mean uh if if there's a if if|%--
me013|i i don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the etsi folk.|s^no
me013|but um if everybody agreed sure let's use this v a d and take that out of there|fh|s.%-
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|they just want apparently they don't want to fix the v a d because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and v a d or frame dropping.|s
mn007|but they still want to just to give some um requirement for this v a d.|s
mn007|because it's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn007|so so it must be at least uh somewhat fixed but not completely.|s
mn007|so there just will be some requirements that are still not uh not yet uh ready i think.|s
me013|determined.|s^2
me013|i see.|s^bk
me013|but i was thinking that that uh sure there may be some interaction.|s^df
me013|but i don't think we need to be stuck on using our or o g i's v a d.|s^ng
me013|we could use somebody else's if it's smaller.|s^cs
me013|or|fh
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
me013|you know as long as it did the job.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so that's good.|s^ba
mn007|uh so there is this thing.|fh|s^rt
mn007|there is|s.%--
mn007|um|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|uh i designed a new a new filter.|s
mn007|because when i designed other filters with shorter delay from the l d a filters there was one filter with sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds.|s
mn007|and uh hynek suggested that both could have sixty five sixty|s.%--
me013|right.|s^bk
mn007|i think it's sixty five.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|both should have sixty five because|s.%-
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|you didn't gain anything right?|s^bu|qy^d^g
mn007|and so i did that.|s
mn007|and uh it's running.|s
mn007|so let's see what will happen.|s
mn007|uh but the filter is of course closer to the reference filter.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|huh.|b
mn007|um yeah.|fh
mn007|i think|%--
me013|so that means logically in principle it should be better.|s^bu
me013|so probably it'll be worse?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa.x
me013|or in the basic perverse nature uh of reality.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|okay.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|sure.|s^aa.x
me026|yeah.|b.x
mn007|yeah and then we've started to work with this of um voiced unvoiced stuff.|fg|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|and next week i think we will perhaps try to have um a new system with uh uh m s g stream also.|s
mn007|see what what happens.|s
mn007|so something that's similar to the proposal too but with m s g stream.|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|huh.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
fn002|no i i begin to play with matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced unvoiced decision.|s
fn002|but only to play.|s
fn002|and we they we found that maybe is a classical parameter the the variance between the um f f t of the signal and the small spectrum of time we after the um mel filter bank.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|and well is more or less robust.|s
fn002|is good for clean speech.|s
fn002|is quite good for noisy speech.|s
me013|huh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|but um we must to have bigger statistic with timit.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|and is not ready yet to use on|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
fn002|well i don't know.|s^no
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|so basically we want to look at something like the the excitation signal and|s.%--
me013|right.|b
fn002|uhhuh.|b
mn007|which are the variance of it and|s.%--
fn002|i have here.|s
fn002|i have here for one signal for one frame.|s
mn007|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fn002|the the mix of the two noise and unnoise and the signal is this.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|clean and this noise.|s
me013|uh.|fg
fn002|these are the two.|s
fn002|the mixed the big signal is for clean.|s
me013|well i'm uh|s.%--
me013|there's|s.%--
me013|none of these axes are labeled.|s
me013|so i don't know what this|s^no.%--
me013|what's this axis?|qw^rt
fn002|uh this is uh this axis is nnn frame.|h|s
me013|frame.|s^bk^m^rt
fn002|uhhuh.|s^aa
me013|and what's what this?|qw^rt
fn002|uh this is uh energy log energy of the spectrum.|h|s
fn002|of the|%--
fn002|this is the variance.|s
fn002|the difference between the spectrum of the signal and f f t of each frame of the signal.|s^e
fn002|and this mouth spectrum of time after the may fit for the two.|s^e
me013|for this one.|s^bu
me013|for the|s^bu.%-
fn002|this big to here they are to signal.|s
fn002|this is for clean and this is for noise.|s
me013|oh.|s^bk
me013|there's two things on the same graph.|s^bu
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|i don't know.|s^no
fn002|i i think that i have another graph.|s
fn002|but i'm not sure.|s^no
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|so which is clean and which is noise?|qw^rt
mn007|i think the lower one is noise.|s
fn002|the lower is noise and the height is clean.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so it's harder to distinguish.|s
fn002|it's height.|s
me013|but it but it|s.%--
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|with noise of course.|s
me013|but but|%--
fn002|oh i must to have.|s
me013|uh|fh
fn002|pity but i don't have two different|s.%-
me013|and presumably when there's a a|s.%-
mn007|so this should the the the voiced portions.|s^bu
me013|uhhuh.|s^aa
fn002|yeah it is the height is voiced portion.|s^aa|s^na
mn007|the the peaks should be voiced portion.|s
fn002|and this is the noise portion.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|and this is more or less like this.|s
fn002|but i meant to have see two two the picture.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
fn002|this is for example for one frame.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
fn002|the the spectrum of the signal.|s
fn002|and this is the small version of the spectrum after m l mel filter bank.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|and this is the difference?|qy^bu^d^rt
fn002|and this is|s.%-
fn002|i don't know.|s^no
fn002|this is not the different.|s^nd
fn002|this is trying to obtain with l p c model the spectrum.|s
fn002|but using matlab without going factor and|s.%--
me013|no pre emphasis.|s
me013|yeah?|qy^d^g^rt
fn002|not pre emphasis.|s^na
fn002|nothing.|s^e
me013|yeah so it's|s.%--
fn002|and the|%-
me013|doesn't do too well there.|s
fn002|i think that this is good.|s
fn002|this is quite similar.|s
fn002|this is this is another frame.|s
fn002|how i obtained the envelope this envelope with the mel filter bank.|s
me013|right.|b
me013|so now i wonder|s.%--
me013|i mean do you want to|qy.%--
me013|i know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum.|s
me013|um but if you were to really try and get a voiced unvoiced do you do you want to totally ignore that?|fh|qy^rt
me013|i mean do you do you|qy.%--
me013|i mean clearly a a very big very big cues for voiced unvoiced come from uh spectral slope and so on.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|s^aa
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|um|fh
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|well this would be this would be perhaps an additional parameter.|s
mn007|simply isn't|%
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|i see.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|b
fn002|yeah because when did noise clear in these section is clear.|s^aa|s
mn007|uh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|if value is indicative that is a voice frame and it's low values.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|well you probably want|s.%--
me013|i mean certainly if you want to do good voiced unvoiced detection you need a few features.|s
me013|each each feature is by itself not enough.|s
me013|but you know people look at at slope and uh first auto correlation coefficient divided by power.|fh|s
mn007|huh.|b
me013|or or uh|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|there's uh|s.%--
me013|i guess we probably don't have enough computation to do a simple pitch detector or something?|qy^d^rt
me013|i mean with a pitch detector you could have a have a an estimate of of what the|s.%--
mn007|huh.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|or maybe you could you just do it going through the p f f t's figuring out some um probable um harmonic structure.|s^cs
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|huh.|b
me013|and and uh|fh
fn002|you have read up and you have a paper the paper that you give me yesterday.|s
mn007|oh yeah.|s^bk
fn002|they say that yesterday they are some problem.|s
mn007|but|fg
mn007|yeah but it's not|s^bk|s^ng.%--
mn007|it's|%--
mn007|yeah it's it's another problem.|s^bk|s^ng
mn007|yeah.|b
fn002|is another problem.|s^m
mn007|um|fh
mn007|yeah there is this fact actually.|s
mn007|if you look at this um spectrum.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|what's this again?|qw
mn007|is it the mel filters?|qy
fn002|yeah like this.|s^aa
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
fn002|of kind like this.|s
mn007|okay.|s^bk
mn007|so the envelope here is the output of the mel filters.|fg|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|and what we clearly see is that in some cases|s.%--
mn007|and it clearly appears here.|s
mn007|and the the harmonics are resolved by the|s.%--
mn007|well there are still appear after mel filtering.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|it's around one hundred one hundred and fifty hertz nnn.|s
me013|right.|b
mn007|and so what happens is that this uh additional variability to this envelope.|s
mn007|and um|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|so we were thinking to modify the mel spectrum to have something that that's smoother on low frequencies.|s
me013|that's as as a separate thing.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|this is a separate thing.|s^m^na
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
me013|separate thing?|qy^bu^d
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|and|fh
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|maybe so.|s^am
me013|um|fh
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|so what|%--
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|what i was talking about was just starting with the f f t.|s^cs
me013|you could you could uh do a very rough thing to estimate estimate uh pitch.|s^cs
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and uh uh given you know given that uh you could uh uh come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was was explained by by uh uh those harmonics.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|it's uh a variant on what you're what you're doing.|s^df
me013|the i mean the the the does give a smooth thing.|s^df
me013|but as you say it's not that smooth here.|s
me013|and and so if you if you just you know subtracted off uh your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so.|s^cs
me013|and and our first kilohertz even.|s^e
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and um if was uh noisy the proportion that it would go down would be|fh|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|if it was if it was unvoiced or something.|s
me013|so you ought to be able to pick out voiced segments.|s
me013|at least it should be another another cue.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so anyway|%
me013|okay.|fg
me013|that's what's going on.|s^rt
me013|uh|fh
me013|what's up with you?|qo^tc
me006|um our i went to talk with uh mike jordan this this week.|h|s^rt
me013|uhhuh.|s^bk
me006|um and uh shared with him the ideas about um extending the larry saul work.|fh|s
me006|and um i asked him some questions about factorial h m m's.|fh|s
me006|so like later down the line when we've come up with these these feature detectors how do we how do we uh you know uh model the time series that that happens.|fh|s
me006|um and and we talked a little bit about factorial h m m's and how um when you're doing inference or when you're doing recognition there's like simple viterbi stuff that you can do for for these h m m's.|fh|s
me006|and the uh the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial h m m's don't um don't over alert the problem.|fh|s
me006|there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on on uh the sub problems at hand.|s
me006|so you can imagine um five or so parallel um features um transitioning independently.|s
me006|and then at the end you you uh couple these factorial h m m's with uh with uh undirected links um based on based on some more data.|s
me013|huh.|b
me006|so he he seemed he seemed like really interested in in um in this.|fh|s
me006|and said said this is this is something very do able and can learn a lot.|s
me006|and um|fh
me006|yeah i've just been continue reading um about certain things.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me006|um|fh
me006|thinking of maybe using um um modulation spectrum stuff to um as features um also in the in the sub bands.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me006|because it seems like the modulation um spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of of certain um words and stuff.|s^e
me006|so um|fh
me006|yeah.|fh
me006|just|%--
me006|that's about it.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me026|okay.|fg
me026|and|fh
me026|um|fh
me026|so i've been looking at avendano's work.|s
me026|and um|fh
me026|uh i'll try to write up in my next status report a nice description of what he's doing.|s^cc
me026|but it's it's an approach to deal with reverberation or that the aspect of his work that i'm interested in.|s^e
me026|the idea is that um normally analysis frames are um too short to encompass reverberation effects um in full.|s
me026|you miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window.|s
me026|and so you you'd like it to be that um the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in.|s
me026|but it's not really with these ten millisecond frames.|fh|s
me026|because you|s.%--
me026|but if you take say a two millisecond um window|s.%--
me026|i'm sorry.|s^fa
me026|a two second window.|s^bsc
me026|then in a room like this most of the reverberation response is included in the window.|s
me026|and the then it um then things are more linear.|s
me026|it is it is more like the reverberation response is simply convolved.|s
me026|and um and you can use channel normalization techniques like|fh|s.%--
me026|uh in his thesis he's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed.|s
me026|he just does um mean subtraction.|s
me026|which is like removing the d c component of the modulation spectrum.|s^e
me026|and that's supposed to um deal uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation.|fh|s
me026|and um the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer.|fh|s
me026|um so he does this um method training trading the um the spectral resolution for time resolution and um come uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower um frequency resolution.|fh|s
me026|so i don't really know the theory.|s^no
me026|i guess it's these are called time frequency representations.|s
me026|and he's making the the time um finer grained and the frequency resolution um less fine grained.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me026|so i'm i guess my first stab actually in continuing his work is to um re implement this this thing which um changes the time and frequency resolutions.|s^cc
me026|because he doesn't have code for me.|s^df
me026|so that that'll take some reading about the theory.|s^cc
me026|i don't really know the theory.|s^no
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me026|oh and um another first step is|fh|s.%--
me026|um|fh
me026|so the the way i want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response.|s^cc
me026|um and um|fh
me026|we don't really know how fast the um the reverberation response is varying the meeting recorder data.|s
me026|um so um we we have this um block least squares um echo canceller implementation.|fh|s
me026|and um i want to try finding the the response say between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller.|fh|s^cc
me026|and looking at the echo canceller taps and then see how fast that varies from block to block.|s^cc
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me026|that should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me013|um i think we're sort of done.|fh|s^tc
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|so let's read our digits and go home.|s^co^t
me026|um|fg
me026|so um|fg
me026|you do i think you read some of the the zeros as o s and some as zeros.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me026|is there a particular way we're supposed to read them?|qy^rt
mn007|there are only zeros here.|s
mn007|well|%--
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|o o o and zero are two ways that we say that digit.|s^nd
mn007|eee.|%
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so it's|s.%--
mn007|but|fg
me006|ha!|s^fe
me013|so it's|s.%-
mn007|perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the|s^cs.%--
mn007|if we want to the the guy to say o.|s
mn007|or|fh
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|i mean i think people will do what they say.|s
mn007|it's|%-
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|it's okay.|s
mn007|okay.|b
me026|all right.|s^bk
me013|i mean in digit recognition we've done before you have you have two pronunciations for that value o and zero.|s
me026|okay.|s^bk
mn007|but it's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then if|s^ng.%--
mn007|because here you only have zeros.|s^df
me013|no they just write|s^nd.%--
mn007|and and people pronounce o or zero.|s^df
me013|they they write down o h.|s
me013|or they write down z e r o.|s
me013|and they and they each have their own pronunciation.|s
mn007|yeah but if the the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the o.|s^bk|s
me013|but people wouldn't know what that|s^nd.%--
me013|i mean there is no convention for it.|s^df
mn007|okay.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
me013|see i mean you'd have to tell them okay when we write this say it|s.%--
me013|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me013|and you just they just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|yep.|b
me013|and and people say it different ways.|s
me026|okay.|fg
me026|is this a change from the last batch of of um forms?|qy^rt
me026|because in the last batch it was spelled out which one you should read.|s^df
mn007|yeah it was orthographic.|fg|s
mn007|so|fh
me013|yes.|s^aa
me013|that's right.|s^aa
me013|it was it was spelled out and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things.|s^na
me026|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|that's also why they're they're bunched together in these different groups.|s
me026|okay.|s^bk
me013|so so it's|%--
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|so it's it's|%--
me013|everything's fine.|s
me026|okay.|b
me013|okay.|fh
me013|actually let me just since since you brought it up i was just it was hard not to be self conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it.|s
me013|but i realized that that um when i'm talking on the phone certainly and and saying these numbers i almost always say zero.|s
me013|and uh because because uh it's two syllables.|s
me013|it's it's more likely they'll understand what i said.|s
me013|so that that that's the habit i'm in.|s
me013|but some people say o and|s.%--
me006|yeah i normally say o because it's easier to say.|s^bk|s^na
me013|yeah it's shorter.|s^na
me013|yeah.|b
me013|so it's so so uh|fh
me006|o|%-
me013|now don't think about it.|s^co
me006|oh no!|s^bk^fe
me013|okay.|s
me013|we're done.|s^t
me018|okay.|z
me013|uh all right.|fg
me013|so i uh uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news.|fh|s^t
me013|um hynek is supposed to come for a couple days next week.|fh|s
me013|don't know which days yet.|s
me013|so hopefully he'll have some intensive time to to work with people.|s
me013|um the second thing is that um we're starting to talk about maybe having sunil come here uh for some chunk of the summer.|fh|s^t
me013|so that may or may not happen.|s
me013|but if he does since actually pratibha is going to be off at i b m um the uh effort will pretty much shift here.|s
me013|because sunil will be here and other people are working on other things i think.|s^df
me013|so so|fh
me013|uh that's my news.|fh|s
mn007|all right.|s^bk
me006|cool.|b
me006|i need a new office mate.|s^tc
me013|oh okay.|s^bk
me013|there you go.|s
me006|right.|b
mn007|it will be sometime in summer.|s
mn007|july or august or|qr^d.%-
me013|yeah i mean it may not happen.|s^arp
me013|i mean he wants uh i think he wants some experience someplace else and he's he's uh thinking of going someplace.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but it's i mean pratibha is getting her experience going to i b m and he may come here.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|but i don't know maybe june.|s^aap
me013|maybe earlier.|s
me013|but uh|fh
me013|anyway hynek will be here next week and maybe he'll know more about it.|s
mn007|oh yeah.|fg
mn007|well the news more specifically for aurora.|s^tc
mn007|um|fh
mn007|so i guess there was again a conference call but uh they are not decide on everything yet.|s
mn007|for the v a d they probably they will do something like having some kind of idealized v a d that they could run on the channel zero of the speechdat car.|s^rt
mn007|and then take the same um end points and apply them on channel one.|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|so it's|%-
me013|oh so take a real v a d but apply it to to to the clean clean data.|s^bu
mn007|uh|%-
mn007|yeah to the clean and take the end points for the noisy.|s^na
mn007|huh.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn007|but i am not sure this is decided yet.|s^am
mn007|um|fh
me013|and and when they're talking about it do you have the impression that they're talking about a particular v a d which everybody would use?|qy^rt
me013|or or just that everybody would use the same procedure?|qrr
mn007|well probably uh the same v a d for everybody.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|um|fh
me018|so they would just provide that as part of the data.|s^bu
mn007|maybe.|s^am
mn007|but this is still|s.%--
me013|yeah.|b
me013|sounds like they're still arguing.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah they're still not decided.|s^na
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|um i don't know what|fg|s.%--
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|nothing much.|s
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|probably the um these weight things they will apply the same kind of weighting scheme for t i digits than for the speechdat car.|s
mn007|so it would be weighting of|s.%--
mn007|um|fh
mn007|it would be an average of improvements rather than an average of word error rates which would make the more clean parts of t i digits more important than they are right now.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|uh but it sounds like none of this is really decided that this is how things are leaning.|s
mn007|this|%--
me013|and|fh
mn007|they they i think they will tend to go this way but huh.|s
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|if we have the result for the tandem with um m s g also|s^rt.%--
mn007|so it was|s.%--
mn007|yeah there is no there is no surprise.|s
mn007|well so there is nor significant improvement.|s
mn007|um yeah basically that's all.|fh|s
mn007|we've started to work on some kind of report for the work so we've not much more results.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah you have a uh you have a lunch talk sometime in|fg|s.%--
mn007|huh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|it's next week yeah.|s^na
me013|when is it?|qw
me013|next week?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|how about the um the thing that you guys were working on before?|qw
me018|the uh uh voiced unvoiced.|s
me018|uh|fh
fn002|oh yes.|s^bk
fn002|but no.|s^ar
fn002|this week i'm i am begin to to write the report on|s.%--
me018|oh.|b
fn002|i stopped it.|s
me018|you stopped working on it.|s^bk
fn002|interfered.|s
me018|i see.|s^bk
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
me013|okay.|fg
me013|uh|fh
me013|so it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit?|qy^d^rt
me013|and and and trying to collate results?|qy^d^rt
me013|and get something from it?|qy^d
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|um.|fg
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|right now sunil seems is in india actually.|s^rt
me013|right.|s^bk
mn007|uh so there is no progress apparently from their side neither.|fh|s
me013|right.|s^bk
mn007|um and|fh|%-
me013|but that sort of puts it on us to do it.|s
me013|but kind of puts it on us to put more in then really.|s
mn007|i'm sorry?|qw^br
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|i mean uh who's who's was uh looking at the combination of uh spectral subtraction approaches with what we had for instance?|qw
mn007|sunil was working on this.|s
me013|okay.|b
mn007|um he sent a bunch of a bunch of results.|fh|s
mn007|uh|fh
mn007|but i don't know what's the status of this.|s
mn007|i guess it was just the result that he sent.|s
mn007|so um|fh
me013|what was that again?|qw^br
mn007|he just used the spectral subtraction and the l d a filters i guess huh.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|and it was not better than what we had before.|s
me013|and|%-
mn007|then he tried to put the online normalization and it did not improve further.|s
mn007|putting the online normalization.|s
mn007|so|fh
mn007|um.|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
me013|huh.|b
me013|huh.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me013|well|fg
mn007|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|i uh i so i guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it and upgrade it?|qy^d
mn007|no.|s^ar
mn007|well i i sent mails to start the the process and i guess we should have to|s.%--
mn007|well we know most what we have to to put in in this.|s
mn007|and|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|so i guess yeah we|s.%--
me013|okay.|b
me013|well uh let's let's come back to this uh later.|s^co
me013|um okay.|fh
me013|um chuck did you get a chance to do anymore stuff with the uh h t k?|fh|qy^rt
me018|no i didn't.|s^ar
me018|um are you talking about|qy^bu.%-
me013|or|qrr.%-
me018|uh no.|s^ar
me018|this week i haven't.|s^nd
me018|i've been my whole time's been taken up with uh meeting recorder stuff.|s^df^ng
me013|okay.|s^bk
me018|uh disk crash and uh covering things.|s^df^ng
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|this may be a very short meeting.|s
me013|uh um|fh
me013|anything from your side?|qy^d
me006|uh continuing readings we come uh we're doing some background reading on phonetics.|s^na
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me006|yeah.|b
me013|dave?|qy^d^rt
me026|well um one thing in in the paper avendano and his collaborators wrote is that is that um they tried doing channel normalization on the reverberant in speech by um subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude over a two second window.|s^na
me026|but they didn't do anything with the phase and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way.|s
me026|so i'm i'm going to start thinking about um ways that the that the phase could be used.|s^cc
me026|um.|fh
me026|if if the um channel and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the phases should be additive.|s
me026|so um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would would help.|fh|s
me026|um but i don't know i i get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me018|oh you know there is one other thing.|s
me018|um stephane showed me a paper yesterday um where uh for the italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um the number of iterations that i talked about last week.|fh|s
me018|and um so there was a whole series of those that they had done.|fh|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me018|they didn't i don't think reported timing for those.|s
me018|but um it turns out that the one that they're actually using was not the best uh in in their series of experiments which i uh maybe it's because they uh wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages and this was only done on italian or something.|fh|s
me013|sure.|s^bk
me013|who's they they?|qw^rt
me018|uh i don't know who did it.|s^no
me018|do you know stephane?|qy
me018|who did that?|qw
mn007|um|h
mn007|i don't know.|s^no
mn007|but it's the company who prepared the italian database.|s
mn007|so it was|s.%--
mn007|is it alcatel?|qy
mn007|or|qrr.%--
fn002|i think so.|s^aa
mn007|i|%--
me013|huh.|b
mn007|i don't know.|s^no
me018|so um you know there wasn't a huge difference in terms of the performance across all the different experiments that they did.|fh|s
me018|um but it varied a little bit.|fh|s
me018|and uh so i guess the main thing that i take out of that is that i think that for our purposes here we could definitely you know decrease the number of iterations that we do.|s^cs
me018|and um|fh
me018|at least while we're you know working on uh all different of kinds of variations and that would let us you know pump through a lot more experiments.|s
me018|so um i still have to to send everybody a pointer about uh how to run the um h t k system on the linux boxes and about changing these number of iterations so that so that you can do that.|fh|s
me018|um so the the other thing that that i was thinking about maybe trying out next is|fh|s.%--
me018|um|fh
me018|oh!|s^fe
me018|the other the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of gaussians per state.|s
me018|and so|s.%-
mn007|uh|fg
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|i think it's was playing with the number of states per word.|s^arp
mn007|they had sixteen seventeen eighteen.|s
mn007|yeah because it was around between sixteen and twenty.|s
mn007|or|%-
me018|okay.|s^bk
me018|i should look at that more carefully because i wonder what they did about|s.%--
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|oh okay.|fg
me018|i was thinking it was gaussians but it's states.|s
mn007|so and|fg
me018|okay.|b
mn007|yeah apparently um they had better results when they increased the number of states.|s
mn007|from from eighteen to twenty or|s.%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|so the thing i was thinking about was uh you know the number of insertions really goes up when you start adding all the noise in.|s
me018|and maybe the thing to do next would be to try to um uh make the silence model more powerful.|s^cs
me018|you know increasing the number of gaussians to the number of states different different things like that.|s^cs
me018|so that's probably the next little thing i'll play with when i get a chance.|s
me013|um|fg
me013|let's see.|fg
me013|um why don't why don't we uh if there aren't any other major things why don't we do the digits and then then uh turn the mikes off.|fh|s^cs^t^tc
me013|so i'll start.|z
me013|uh.|z
mn007|did you put two?|z
fn002|my name is maria.|z
mn007|oh yeah.|z
fn002|this.|z
mn007|maria carmen?|z
fn002|yeah.|z
mn007|uhhuh.|z
me013|okay.|z
me013|let's see.|z
me013|test?|z
me013|test?|z
me013|yeah.|z
me013|okay.|z
mn007|channel one.|z
me006|hello?|z
me006|hello?|z
fn002|test.|z
me013|i was saying hynek will be here next week.|s
me013|uh wednesday through friday.|s^e
me013|uh through saturday.|s^e
me013|and um|fh
me013|i won't be here thursday and friday.|s
me013|but my suggestion is that uh at least for this meeting people should go ahead.|s^cs
me013|uh because hynek will be here.|s^df
me013|and|%--
me013|you know we don't have any czech accent yet.|s^df^j
me013|uh as far as i know.|s^df
me013|so|fh
me018|okay.|s^bk
me013|there we go.|s
me013|um|fg
me013|so other than reading digits what's our agenda?|qw^rt^t^tc
me018|i don't really have uh anything new.|s
me018|been working on meeting recorder stuff.|s
me018|so|fh
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|um|fg
me013|do you think that would be the case for next week also?|qy^rt
me013|or is is uh|qrr.%--
me013|what's your projection on|qw.%--
me018|um|h
me013|because the one thing the one thing that seems to me we really should try if you hadn't tried it before because it hadn't occurred to me.|s^cs
me013|it was sort of an obvious thing.|s^df
me013|is um adjusting the uh the scaling and uh insertion penalty sort of stuff.|s^cs
me018|i did play with that actually a little bit.|s
me018|um what happens is uh when you get to the noisy stuff you start getting lots of insertions.|s
me013|right.|s^bk^rt
me018|and um|fh
me018|so i've tried playing around a little bit with um the insertion penalties and things like that.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me018|um|fh
me018|i mean it it didn't make a whole lot of difference.|s
me018|like for the well matched case it seemed like it was pretty good.|s^e
me018|um i could do more playing with that though.|fh|s^cc
me018|and uh|fh
me018|and see.|s^cc
me013|but you were looking at mel cepstrum.|s^bu
me018|yes.|s^aa
me013|right.|s^bk
me018|oh you're talking about for for our features.|s^bu
me013|right.|s^aa
me013|so i mean it's not the direction that you were working with that we were saying what's the uh what's the best you can do with with mel cepstrum.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|but they raised a very valid point.|s
me013|which i guess|s^e.%--
me013|so to first order i mean you have other things you were going to do.|s
me013|but to first order i would say that the conclusion is that if you um do uh some monkeying around with uh the exact h t k training and with uh you know how many states and so forth that it it doesn't particularly improve the performance.|s
me013|in other words that even though it sounds pretty dumb just applying the same number of states to everything more or less no matter what language isn't so bad.|s^bs
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me013|and i guess you hadn't gotten to all the experiments you wanted to do with number of gaussians.|s^bu
me018|right.|s^aa
me013|but um|fh
me013|let's just|s.%--
me013|if we had to if we had to draw a conclusion on the information we have so far we'd say something like that.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh so the next question to ask which is i think the one that that that andreas was addressing himself to in the lunch meeting is um we're not supposed to adjust the back end.|fh|s
me013|but anybody using the system would.|s
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so|fh
me013|if you were just adjusting the back end how much better would you do uh in noise?|qw
me013|uh because the language scaling and insertion penalties and so forth are probably set to be about right for mel cepstrum.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|s^bk
me013|but um they're probably not at all set right for these things.|fh|s
me013|particularly these things that look over uh larger time windows in one way or another with with l d a and k l t and neural nets and all these things.|s^e
me013|in the past we've always found that we had to increase the insertion penalty to to correspond to such things.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|i think that's uh that's kind of a first order thing that that we should try.|s^cs
me018|so for|s.%--
me018|so the experiment is to um run our front end like normal with the default uh insertion penalties and so forth.|s^bu
me018|and then tweak that a little bit.|s^bu
me018|and see how much of a difference it makes.|s^bu
me013|so by our front end i mean take you know the aurora two take some version that stephane has that is you know our current best version of something.|s^na
me018|if we were|s.%-
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|i mean don't want to do this over a hundred different things that they've tried.|s
me013|but you know for some version that you say is a good one.|s
me013|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me013|um|fh
me013|how how much uh does it improve if you actually adjust that?|qw
me018|okay.|s^bk
me013|but it is interesting.|s
me013|you say you you have for the noisy|s.%--
me013|how about for the for the mismatched or or or or the or the medium mismatched conditions?|qw
me013|have you|qy.%--
me013|when you adjusted those numbers for mel cepstrum did it|qy.%--
me018|uh i i don't remember off the top of my head.|s^no
me018|um|fh
me018|yeah i didn't even write them down.|s^df
me018|i i i don't remember.|s^no
me018|i would need to|s.%--
me018|well i did write down|s.%--
me018|um|fh
me018|so when i was doing i just wrote down some numbers for the well matched case.|s
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me018|um|fh
me018|looking at the i wrote down what the deletions substitutions and insertions were.|s^e
me018|uh|fh
me018|for different numbers of states per phone.|s^e
me013|yeah.|b
me018|um but uh that that's all i wrote down.|s
me013|okay.|s^bk
me018|so|fh
me018|i i would|s.%--
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|i would need to do that.|s^cc
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so|fg
me018|i can do that for next week.|s^cc
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|and um|fh
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|also uh uh sometimes if you run behind on some of these things maybe we can get someone else to do it.|s^cs
me013|and you can supervise or something.|s^cs
me013|but|fh
me013|but i think it would be it'd be good to know that.|s
me018|okay.|s^aa
me018|i just need to get um front end uh stuff from you.|s
mn007|huh.|b
me018|or you point me to some files that you've already calculated.|s^cs
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|all right.|s^aa
me013|okay.|b
me013|uh|b
me018|i probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence model.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me018|so maybe i can have that for next week when hynek's here.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|because i mean the the other|s.%--
me013|that in fact might have been part of what uh the difference was.|s
me013|at least part of it that that we were seeing.|s^e
me013|remember we were seeing the s r i system was so much better than the tandem system.|s^e
me018|huh.|b
me013|part of it might just be that the s r i system they they they always adjust these things to be sort of optimized.|s^e
me018|is there|qy.%--
me013|and|%--
me018|i wonder if there's anything that we could do to the front end that would affect the insertion.|s
me013|yes.|s^aa
me013|i think you can.|s^na
me018|what could you do?|qw
me013|well um|h
me013|uh|fh
me013|part of what's going on um is the uh the range of values.|s
me013|so if you have something that has a much smaller range or a much larger range and taking the appropriate root.|s
me018|oh!|s^bk^fe
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me013|if something is kind of like the equivalent of a bunch of probabilities multiplied together you can take a root of some sort.|s^cs
me013|if it's like seven probabilities together you can take the seventh root of it or something.|s^cs
me013|or if it's in the log domain divide it by seven.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|but|%--
me013|but|%--
me013|um|fh
me013|that has a similar effect.|s
me013|because it changes the scale of the numbers of the differences between different candidates from the acoustic model.|s^df
me018|oh.|s^bk
me018|right.|s^aa
me013|as opposed to what's coming from the language model.|s^e
me018|so that|s.%-
me018|right.|s^bk
me018|so in effect that's changing the value of your insertion penalty.|s
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|i mean it's more directly like the the language scaling or the uh the model scaling or acoustic scaling.|s^df
me018|that's interesting.|s^ba
me013|but you know that those things have kind of a similar effect to the insertion penalty.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|anyway they're a slightly different way of of handling it.|s
me018|right.|s^bk
me013|so um|fh
me018|so if we know what the insertion penalty is then we can get an idea about what range our number should be in.|s^bu
me018|so that they match with that.|s^bu
me013|i think so.|s^na
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|so that's why i think|s.%--
me013|that's another reason other than curiosity as to why it would in fact be kind of neat to find out if we're way off.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean the other thing is aren't we seeing|qy.%--
me013|i'm sure you've already looked at this.|s
me013|in these noisy cases are we are seeing lots of insertions.|s^bu
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me013|the insertion number is quite high?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|i know the v a d takes care of part of that.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me013|but|%--
me018|i've seen that with the mel cepstrum.|s^na
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me018|i don't i don't know about the aurora front end.|s^no
me018|but|%--
mn007|i think it's much more balanced with uh when the front end is more robust.|s
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|i could look at it at this.|s^cc
mn007|yeah.|fh
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|what's a typical number?|qw^rt
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|i don't i don't know.|s^no
me013|do we|qy.%--
me013|oh you oh you don't know.|s^bk^m
me013|okay.|s^bk
mn007|i don't have this in|s^df.%-
me013|i'm sure it's more balanced.|s
me013|but it it it wouldn't surprise me if there's still|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|i mean in in the the the old systems we used to do i i uh i remember numbers kind of like insertions being half the number of deletions as being and both numbers being tend to be on the small side comparing to to uh substitutions.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|well this|s.%--
me018|the whole problem with insertions was what i think um we talked about when the guy from o g i came down that one time.|s
me018|and|%--
me018|and that was when people were saying well we should have a uh uh voice activity detector.|s
me013|right.|s^bk
me018|that because all that stuff that we're getting the silence that's getting through is causing insertions.|s
me018|so|fh
me013|right.|b
mn007|huh.|b
me018|i'll bet you there's still a lot of insertions.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|and it may be less of a critical thing.|s
me013|i mean the fact that some get by may be less of a critical thing if you uh get things in the right range.|s^e^r
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i mean the insertions is is a symptom.|s
me013|it's a symptom that there's something uh wrong with the range.|s^e
me018|right.|b
me013|but there's uh your your your substitutions tend to go up as well.|s
me013|so uh i i i think that|s.%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh the most obvious thing is just the insertions.|s
me013|but|fh
me013|uh|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|if you're operating in the wrong range i mean that's why just in general if you change what these these penalties and scaling factors are you reach some point that's a that's a minimum.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|we do have to do well over a range of different conditions.|s
me013|some of which are noisier than others.|s^e
me013|um|fh
me013|but um i think we may get a better handle on that if we if we see|fh|s^cs.%--
me013|um i mean we|fh|s.%--
me013|it's if we actually could pick a a a more stable value for the range of these features it um uh could|s.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|even though it's it's it's true that in a real situation you can in fact adjust the these these scaling factors in the back end and it's artificial here that we're not adjusting those you certainly don't want to be adjusting those all the time.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|and if you have a nice front end that's in roughly the right range.|s
me013|i remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level.|s
me013|and we would rarely adjust them again.|s
me013|even though you could get a|s^e.%--
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|for an evaluation you can get an extra point or something if you tweaked it a little bit.|s^e^r
me013|but|fh
me013|once we knew what roughly the right operating range was it was pretty stable.|s
me013|and uh we might just not even be in the right operating range.|s
me018|so would the|qy.%--
me018|uh would a good idea be to try to map it into the same range that you get in the well matched case?|qy^cs^rt
me018|so if we computed what the range was in well matched and then when we get our noisy conditions out we try to make it have the same range as|s^e.%--
me013|no you don't want to change it for different conditions.|s^ar|s^nd
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|no.|s^ar^r
me013|i i i what what i'm saying|s.%--
me018|oh i wasn't suggesting change it for different conditions.|s^ng
me018|i was just saying that when we pick a range we we want to pick a range that we map our numbers into.|s
me018|we should probably pick it based on the range that we get in the well matched case.|s^cs
me013|yeah.|b
me018|otherwise i mean what range are we going to choose?|qw
me018|to to map everything into.|s^e
me013|well it depends how much we want to do gamesmanship and how much we want to do|s^aap.%--
me013|i mean if|s.%--
me013|it to me actually even if you want to be play on the gamesmanship side it can be kind of tricky.|s
me013|so i mean what you would do is set the set the scaling factors uh so that you got the best number for this point four five times the you know and so on.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|but they might change that.|s
me013|those weightings.|s^e
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me013|um|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|uh|fh
me013|i just sort of think we need to explore the space.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|just take a look at it a little bit.|s
me018|okay.|b
me013|and we we we may just find that that we're way off.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|maybe we're not.|s
me013|you know.|fh
me013|as for these other things it may turn out that uh it's kind of reasonable.|s^df
me013|but then|s.%--
me013|i mean andreas gave a very reasonable response.|s
me013|and he's probably not going to be the only one who's going to say this in the future.|s
me013|of you know|s^e.%--
me013|people people within this tight knit community who are doing this evaluation are accepting uh more or less that these are the rules.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|but people outside of it who look in at the broader picture are certainly going to say well wait a minute you're doing all this standing on your head uh on the front end.|s
me013|when all you could do is just adjust this in the back end with one one knob.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|and|%--
me013|so we have to at least i think determine that that's not true.|s^co
me013|which would be okay.|s^e
me013|or determine that it is true.|s^co
me013|in which case we want to adjust that.|s^co
me013|and then continue with with what we're doing.|s^co
me018|right.|b
me013|and as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that in the front end also then becomes a priority for this particular test.|s
me013|and saying you don't have to do that.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|so|fh
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so uh|fh
me013|what's new with you?|qw^rt^tc
mn007|uh|h
mn007|so there's nothing new.|s
me013|uh what's old with you that's developed?|qw^j
mn007|um.|fh
mn007|i'm sorry?|qw^br^d^rt
me013|you|%
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|what's old with you that has developed over the last week or two?|qw^j
mn007|huh.|h
mn007|well so we've been mainly working on the report.|s
mn007|and and|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
me018|mainly working on what?|qw^br^d^rt
mn007|on the report of the work that was already done.|s^rt
me018|oh.|s^bk
mn007|um|fh
me018|how about that|qw.%-
mn007|uhhuh.|fh
mn007|that's all.|s
me018|anything new on the thing that uh you were working on with the uh|qy^d.%--
fn002|i don't have results yet.|s^nd
me018|no results.|s^bk^m
me018|yeah.|fh
me013|what was that?|qw^br^rt
me018|the the|s.%--
me018|uh|fh
me006|voicing thing.|s^2
me018|voicing detector.|s^m^na
me013|i mean what's what's going on now?|qw
me013|what are you doing?|qw
fn002|uh to try to found nnn robust feature for detect between voice and unvoice.|h|s
fn002|and we we try to use the variance of the difference between the f f t spectrum and mel filter bank spectrum.|s^rt
me013|yeah.|b
fn002|uh also the another parameter is relates with the auto correlation function.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|r energy and the variance also of the auto correlation function.|s^e
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|so that's|s.%--
me013|yeah that's what you were describing i guess a week or two ago.|s^bu
me013|so|fh
fn002|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|but we don't have we don't have result of the for aurora yet.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|we need to train the neural network.|s
fn002|and|fh
me013|so you're training neural networks now?|qy^bu^d^rt
fn002|no.|s^ar
fn002|not yet.|s^nd
me013|so what what's going on?|qw^rt
fn002|well we work in the report too.|s
fn002|because we have a lot of result.|s^df
me013|uhhuh.|b
fn002|they are very dispersed.|s^df
fn002|and was necessary to to look in all the directory to to to give some more structure.|s^df
me013|so so|fg
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|if i can summarize basically what's going on is that you're going over a lot of material that you have generated in furious fashion.|s^bs
me013|generating many results and doing many experiments.|s^bs
me013|and trying to pull it together into some coherent form to be able to see see what happens.|s^bs
fn002|huh huh.|b
mn007|uh|fg
mn007|yeah basically we've stopped uh experimenting.|s^nd
me013|yes?|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|i mean we're just writing some kind of technical report.|s
mn007|and|fh
me018|is this a report that's for aurora?|qy^rt
me018|or is it just like a tech report for icsi?|qrr^rt
fn002|no.|s^ar
me018|or|qrr.%--
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|for icsi.|s^m^na
me018|uh.|s^bk
me018|i see.|s^bk
mn007|yeah.|b
fn002|just summary of the experiment and the conclusion.|s^df
fn002|and|%--
fn002|something like that.|s^e
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me013|so my suggestion though is that you you not necessarily finish that.|s^cs
me013|but that you put it all together so that it's you've got you've got a clearer structure to it.|s^cs
me013|you know what things are.|s^e
me013|you have things documented.|s^e
me013|you've looked things up that you needed to look up.|s^e
me013|so that you know so that such a thing can be written.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and um|fh
me013|when when when do you leave again?|qw^rt
fn002|uh in july.|h|s
fn002|first of july.|s^e
me013|first of july.|s^bk^m
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|and that you figure on actually finishing it in in june.|s^cs
me013|because you know you're going to have another bunch of results to fit in there anyway.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
fn002|uhhuh.|b
me013|and right now it's kind of important that we actually go forward with experiments.|s^df
fn002|it's not|s.%-
me013|so so i i think it's good to pause and to gather everything together and make sure it's in good shape.|s^cs
me013|so that other people can get access to it.|s^df
me013|and so that it can go into a report in june.|s^df
me013|but i think to to really work on on fine tuning the report at this point is is probably bad timing i i think.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|well we didn't|s.%--
mn007|we just planned to work on it one week on this report.|s^df
mn007|not no more anyway.|s^e
mn007|um|fh
me013|but you you may really want to add other things later anyway.|s^cs
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|because you|s^df.%--
mn007|huh.|b
me013|there's more to go?|qy^d^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|well|fh
mn007|so i don't know there are small things that we started to to do.|s^e
mn007|but|%-
me018|are you discovering anything uh that makes you scratch your head as you write this report?|qy^rt
me018|like why did we do that.|s^e
me018|or why didn't we do this.|s^e
mn007|uh|h
me018|or|fh
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|yeah.|s^aa^r
mn007|and|%--
mn007|actually there were some tables that were also with partial results.|s^e
mn007|we just noticed that.|s
mn007|while gathering the result that for some conditions we didn't have everything.|s^e
me018|huh.|b
mn007|but anyway.|fh
mn007|um|fh
mn007|yeah yeah.|fg
mn007|we have yeah extracted actually the noises from the speechdat car.|s
mn007|and so|fh
mn007|we can train neural network with speech and these noises.|s
mn007|um|fh
mn007|it's difficult to say what it will give.|s
mn007|because when we look at the aurora the t i digits experiments um they have these three conditions that have different noises.|s^df
mn007|and apparently this system perform as well on the seen noises on the unseen noises and on the seen noises.|s^rt
mn007|but|%--
mn007|i think this is something we have to try anyway.|s^cs
mn007|so|fh
mn007|adding the noises from from the speechdat car.|s^e
mn007|um|fh
me013|that's|s.%--
me013|that's uh|s.%--
me013|that's permitted?|qy^d^rt
mn007|uh|h
mn007|well|fh
mn007|o g i does did that.|s^na
mn007|um|fh
mn007|at some point they did that for for the voice activity detector.|s^bu^e
fn002|uh for a v a d.|s^2
mn007|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|um|fh
me018|could you say it again.|s^br^rt
me018|what what exactly did they do?|qw^br^rt
mn007|they used some parts of the um italian database to train the voice activity detector i think.|s
mn007|it|%-
me013|yeah i guess the thing is|fg|s.%--
me013|yeah.|fh
me013|i guess that's a matter of interpretation.|s
me013|the rules as i understand it is that in principle the italian and the spanish and the english|s.%--
me013|no.|s^ar
me013|italian and the finnish and the english were development data.|s^bsc^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|and spanish yeah.|s
me013|on which you could adjust things.|s^e
me013|and the and the german and danish were the evaluation data.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and then when they finally actually evaluated things they used everything.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|that's right.|s^aa
me013|so|fh
mn007|uh|fh
me013|uh|fh
me013|and it is true that the performance uh on the german was|s.%--
me013|i mean even though the improvement wasn't so good the the raw performance was really pretty good.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so|fh
me013|and uh|fh
me013|it it doesn't appear that there's strong evidence that even though things were somewhat tuned on those three or four languages that that going to a different language really hurt you.|s
me013|and the noises were not exactly the same.|s
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|because it was taken from a different|s^df.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|i mean they were different drives.|s
mn007|different cars.|s^2
me013|i mean it was it was actual different cars and so on.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|so|fh
me013|um it's somewhat tuned.|fh|s
me013|it's tuned more than you know a a a a|s^e.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|you'd really like to have something that needed no particular noise at all.|s
me013|maybe just some white noise or something like that at most.|s^e
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but that's not really what this contest is.|s
me013|so|fh
me013|um i guess it's okay.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|i think it's|s.%-
me013|that's something i'd like to understand before we actually use something from it.|s
me013|because it would|s^df.%-
me018|it's probably something that huh the you know the uh experiment designers didn't really think about.|s
me018|because i think most people aren't doing trained systems or you know uh systems that are like ours where you actually use the data to build models.|s^df
me018|i mean they just doing signal processing.|s^df
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|so|fh
me013|well it's true.|s^na
me013|except that uh that's what we used in aurora one.|s^arp
me013|and then they designed the things for aurora two knowing that we were doing that.|s
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me018|that's true.|s^aa
me013|um|fh
me018|and they didn't forbid us.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|to build models on the data?|qy^bu^d^e^rt
me013|no.|s^aa
me013|but i think i think that it it|s.%--
me013|it probably would be the case that if say we trained on italian uh data and then uh we tested on danish data and it did terribly uh that that it would look bad.|s
me013|and i think someone would notice.|s
me013|and would say well look this is not generalizing.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|i would hope i would hope they would.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|but uh|fh
me013|it's true.|s
me013|you know maybe there's parameters that other people have used.|s
me013|you know that they have tuned in some way for other things.|s^e
me013|so it's it's uh|s.%--
me013|we should we should|s^cs.%--
me013|maybe that's maybe a topic.|s
me013|especially if you talk with him when i'm not here.|s^e
me013|that's a topic you should discuss with hynek.|s^co
me013|to you know double check it's okay.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|do we know anything about the speakers for each of the uh training utterances?|qy^rt
mn007|what do you mean?|qw
me018|do you have speaker information?|qy
mn007|we we|s.%--
me013|social security number.|s^j
me018|that would be good.|s^ba
mn007|like we have male female.|s
me018|bank pin.|s^j
fn002|huh.|b
me018|just male female?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn007|at least.|s^nd
mn007|huh.|b
me013|what kind of information do you mean?|qw
me018|well i was thinking about things like you know gender uh you know gender specific nets and uh vocal tract length normalization.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|things like that.|s^e
me018|i i don't i didn't know what information we have about the speakers that we could try to take advantage of.|s^df^no
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|huh.|b
me013|uh|fg
me013|right.|fg
me013|i mean again if you had the whole system you were optimizing that would be easy to see.|s
me013|but if you're supposedly just using a fixed back end and you're just coming up with a feature vector i'm not sure|s.%--
me013|i mean having the two nets suppose you detected that it was male it was female you come up with different|s.%-
me018|well you could put them both in as separate streams or something.|s
me018|uh|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|maybe.|s^am
me018|i don't know.|s^no
me018|i was just wondering if there was other information we could exploit.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|huh.|b
me013|yeah it's an interesting thought.|s^bk|s^ba
me013|maybe having something along the|s.%--
me013|i mean you can't really do vocal tract normalization.|s
me013|but something that had some of that effect.|s
me018|yeah.|s^bk
me013|being applied to the data in some way.|s^e
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
mn007|do you have something simple in mind for i mean vocal tract length normalization?|qy^rt
me018|uh no i hadn't i hadn't thought it was thought too much about it really.|s^ar|s^nd
me018|it just something that popped into my head just now.|s^df^nd
me018|and so i i|s.%--
me018|i mean you could maybe use the ideas a similar idea to what they do in vocal tract length normalization.|s^cs
me018|you know you have some sort of a uh general speech model.|s
me018|you know maybe just a mixture of gaussians that you evaluate every utterance against.|s^e
me018|and then you see where each you know utterance like the likelihood of each utterance you divide the the range of the likelihoods up into discrete bins.|s
me018|and then each bin's got some knob uh setting.|s
me013|yeah but just listen to yourself.|fg|s^nd
me013|i mean that uh really doesn't sound like a real time thing with less than two hundred milliseconds uh latency that and where you're not adjusting the statistical engine at all.|s^nd
me018|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|that's true.|b
me018|right.|b
me013|you know that just|s.%--
mn007|huh.|b
me018|could be expensive.|s^2
me013|i mean.|fg
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|no|s^ar.%--
me013|well not just expensive.|s^arp
me013|i i i don't see how you could possibly do it.|s^nd
me013|you can't look at the whole utterance and do anything you know you can only|s^df.%--
me018|oh!|s^bk^fe
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
me018|right.|s^bk
me013|each frame comes in and it's got to go out the other end.|s^df
me018|right.|s^aa
me013|so uh|fh
me018|so whatever it was it would have to be uh sort of on a per frame basis.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|s^aa
me013|i mean you can do|s^cs.%--
me013|um|fh
me018|yeah.|b
me013|fairly quickly you can do male female male female stuff.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|but as far as|s.%--
me013|i mean like i thought b b n did a thing with uh uh vocal tract normalization a ways back.|s
me013|maybe other people did too.|s
me013|with with uh uh trying to identify third formant average third formant using that as an indicator of|s^e.%--
me018|i don't know.|s^no
me013|so|fg
me013|you know third formant|s.%--
me013|if you imagine that to first order what happens with uh changing vocal tract is that uh the formants get moved out by some proportion.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|so if you had a first formant that was one hundred hertz before if the fifty if the vocal tract is fifty percent shorter then it would be out at seven fifty hertz.|s^e
me013|and so on.|s^e
me013|so that's a move of two hundred fifty hertz.|s^bs
me013|whereas the third formant which might have started off at twenty five hundred hertz you know might be out to thirty seven fifty.|s^e
me013|you know so it's at|s.%--
me013|so|fh
me013|although you frequently get less distinct higher formants it's still third formant's kind of a reasonable compromise.|s
me013|and|fh
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|so i think uh if i recall correctly they did something like that.|s
me018|huh.|b
me013|and and|fh
me013|but um that doesn't work for just having one frame or something.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me013|you know that's more like looking at third formant over over a turn or something like that.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and|%--
me018|right.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|but on the other hand male female is a is a is a much simpler categorization than figuring out a a factor to uh squish or expand the the spectrum.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|so um|fh
me013|you could imagine that|s.%--
me013|i mean just like we're saying voiced unvoiced is good to know.|s
me013|uh male female is good to know also.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|um|fh
me013|but you'd have to figure out a way to to to uh incorporate it on the fly.|s
me013|uh i mean i guess as you say one thing you could do is simply uh have the the male and female output vectors you know nets trained only on males and trained only on females.|fh|s^cs
me013|or|%--
me013|or uh|fh
me013|you know.|fh
me013|but|%--
me013|um|fh
me013|i don't know if that would really help.|s^no
me013|because you already have males and females.|s^df
me013|and it's uhhuh putting into one net.|s^df
me013|so|fh
me013|is it|qy.%-
me018|is it balanced?|qy^rt
me018|um in terms of gender.|s^e
me018|the data?|qy^d^rt
me013|do you know?|qy
mn007|huh.|h
mn007|almost.|s^aap
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me018|huh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|huh.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me013|you're you were saying before.|s
mn007|uh yeah.|h
mn007|so this noise|s.%--
mn007|um|fh
mn007|yeah the m s g|s.%--
mn007|um|fh
mn007|huh|fh
mn007|there is something perhaps i could spend some days to look at this thing.|s^cc^rt
mn007|because it seems that when we train networks on let's say on timit with m s g features they they look as good as networks trained on p l p.|s^df^rt
mn007|but|fh
mn007|um|fh
mn007|when they are used on on the speechdat car data it's not the case.|s
mn007|oh well.|s^bk
mn007|the m s g features are much worse.|s
mn007|and so maybe they're um less more sensitive to different recording conditions.|s^e
me013|shouldn't be.|s^nd
mn007|or|s.%-
me013|they should be less so.|s^df^nd
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|but|%--
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g^rt
mn007|huh.|b
me013|but let me ask you this.|s^co
me013|what what's the um|qw.%--
me013|do you recall if the insertions were were higher with m s g?|qy^rt
mn007|i don't know.|s^no
mn007|i cannot tell.|s^no
mn007|but|%--
mn007|it's it|s.%--
mn007|the the error rate is higher.|s
me013|yeah but you should always look at insertions deletions and substitutions.|s^bk|s^co
mn007|so i|s.%-
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so uh|fh
me013|m s g is very very|s.%--
me013|uh p l p is very much like mel cepstrum.|s
me013|m s g is very different from both of them.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so if it's very different then this is the sort of thing|s.%--
me013|i mean i'm really glad andreas brought this point up.|s
me013|i sort of had forgotten to discuss it.|s^df
me013|um|fh
me013|you always have to look at how this uh these adjustments uh affect things.|s^co
me013|and even though we're not allowed to do that again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features.|s
me013|so if it if in fact uh|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|the problem might be that the range of the m s g features is quite different than the range of the p l p or mel cepstrum.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|and you might want to change that.|s^cs
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|but|fg
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|but it's it's after|s.%--
mn007|well it's tandem features.|s
mn007|so|fh
mn007|huh|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|we we have estimation of posteriors with p l p and with m s g as input.|s
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|so i|s.%--
mn007|well.|fh
mn007|i don't know.|s^no
me013|that means they're between zero and one.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|s^aa
me013|but it it it it doesn't necessarily|s.%--
me013|you know they could be|s.%--
me013|um|fh
me013|doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is.|s
mn007|huh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|right?|qy^d^f^g
me013|because if you're taking the log of these things it could be|s^df.%--
me013|uh|fh
me013|knowing what the sum of the probabilities are doesn't tell you what the sum of the logs are.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
me013|so|fh
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|so we should look at the likelihood.|s^cs
mn007|or or|fh
mn007|what|%--
mn007|or|fh
mn007|well|fh
mn007|at the log perhaps.|s^cs^rt
mn007|and|fh
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me013|or what you know what you're uh the thing you're actually looking at.|s^cs
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|so your your|s.%--
me013|the values that are are actually being fed into h t k.|s^rt
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|what do they look like?|qw
mn007|but|fg
me018|and so the uh for the tandem system the values that come out of the net don't go through the sigmoid.|s^bu
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|they're sort of the pre nonlinearity values?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|right.|s^aa
mn007|yes.|s^aa
me013|so they're kind of like log probabilities is what i was saying.|s^df
me018|and those|s.%-
me018|okay.|s^bk
me018|and that's what goes into h t k?|qy^bu^d^rt
me013|uh almost.|h|s^aap
me013|but then you actually do a k l t on them.|s
me018|okay.|s^bk
me013|um|fh
me013|they aren't normalized after that.|s^bu
me013|are they?|qy^g^rt
mn007|huh no.|h|s^ar
mn007|they are not.|s^nd
me013|no.|s^bk^m
mn007|no.|s^ar
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|so um|fh
me013|right.|fg
me013|so the question is yeah whatever they are at that point um are they something for which taking a square root or cube root or fourth root or something like that is is going to be a good or a bad thing.|s
me013|so|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh and that's something that|s.%--
me013|nothing nothing else after that is going to|s^bsc.%--
me013|uh things are going to scale it.|s
me013|uh you know subtract things from it.|s
me013|scale it from it.|s
me013|but nothing will have that same effect.|s
me013|um|fh
me013|so|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|anyway uh|fg
me018|yeah.|fg
me018|because if if the log probs that are coming out of the m s g are really big the standard insertion penalty is going to have very little effect.|s
me013|well the|fg
me013|right.|s^bk
me018|compared to you know a smaller set of log probs.|s^e
me013|yeah.|b
me013|no again you don't really look at that.|fg|s
me013|it's something that|s.%--
me013|and then it's going through this transformation that's probably pretty close to|s.%--
me013|it's uh whatever the k l t is doing.|s
me013|but it's probably pretty close to what a a a discrete cosine transformation is doing.|s^e
me018|yeah.|b
me013|but still it's it's not going to probably radically change the scale of things.|s
me013|i would think.|s
me013|and uh|fh
me013|yeah.|fg
me013|it may be entirely off.|s
me013|and and it may be at the very least it may be quite different for m s g than it is for mel cepstrum or p l p.|s
me013|so that would be|s.%--
me013|so the first thing i'd look at without adjusting anything would just be to go back to the experiment and look at the uh substitutions insertions and deletions.|s^cs
me013|and if the if|s.%--
me013|the uh|fh
me013|if there's a fairly large effect of the difference say uh uh the ratio between insertions and deletions for the two cases then that would be uh an indicator that it might might be in that direction.|s^e
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|anything else?|qo^d
mn007|yeah but|fg
mn007|my my point was more that it it works sometimes.|s
mn007|and|%--
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|but sometimes it doesn't work.|s^e
mn007|so|fh
me013|well.|fg
mn007|and it works on t i digits.|s^e
mn007|and on speechdat car it doesn't work.|s^e
mn007|and|%--
me013|yeah.|s^bk
mn007|uhhuh.|fh
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|well.|fh
me013|but you know some problems are harder than others.|s^bd
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|s^bk
me013|and|fh
me013|and uh sometimes you know there's enough evidence for something to work.|fh|s
me013|and then it's harder.|s
me013|it breaks.|s
me013|you know?|qy^d^f^g
me013|so it's|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|but it but um it it could be that when you say it works maybe we could be doing much better.|s
me013|even in t i digits.|s^e
me013|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
me013|so|fh
mn007|yeah sure.|s^aa
mn007|uh|fh
me013|huh.|b
me013|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|well.|fg
mn007|there is also the spectral subtraction.|s
mn007|which|s^e.%--
mn007|um|fh
mn007|i think maybe we should uh try to integrate it in in our system.|s^cs^rt
me013|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|huh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me013|right.|b
mn007|but|fg
mn007|i think that would involve to to huh use a big a already a big bunch of the system of ericsson.|s^cs
mn007|because he has spectral subtraction.|s^df^rt
mn007|then it's followed by um other kind of processing that's are dependent on the uh if it's speech or or silence.|s^df^rt
me013|uhhuh.|b
mn007|and there is this kind of spectral flattening after if it's silence.|s^df^rt
mn007|and|fh
mn007|and i i think it's important um to reduce this musical noise and this this increase of variance during silence portions.|s^cs
mn007|so|fh
mn007|well.|fh
mn007|this was this would involve to take almost everything from from the this proposal.|s^cs^e
mn007|and|fh
mn007|and then just add some kind of on line normalization in in the neural network.|s^cs^e^rt
mn007|huh.|b
me013|okay.|s^bk
me013|well this'll be i think something for discussion with hynek next week.|s

me026|but it'll be less complicated.|s^e
me026|because i will not be a considered a resident of canada anymore.|s^df
me026|so i won't have to declare my american income on my canadian return.|s^df
me013|okay.|b
me013|all right.|fg
me013|uh|fg
me013|barry?|qy^d^rt
me013|do you want to say something about your stuff here?|qy^cs
me006|oh.|s^bk
me006|um|fh
me006|right.|s^aa
me006|i just um continuing looking at uh uh phonetic events.|s^rt
me006|and uh this tuesday going to be uh meeting with john ohala with chuck to talk some more about these uh um phonetic events.|s^rt
me006|um came up with uh a plan of attack.|fh|s
me006|uh going to execute.|s^cc
me006|and|fh
me006|um|fh
me006|yeah.|s^bk
me006|it's that's pretty much it.|s
me013|oh well.|fg
me013|um why don't you say something about what it is?|qo^co
me006|oh.|s^bk
me006|you oh you want you want details.|s^bs
me006|huh|fh
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|well we're all gathered here together.|s^j
me013|i thought we'd you know|s^j.%--
me006|i was hoping i could wave my hands.|s^j
me006|um|fh
me006|so|fh
me006|um|fh
me006|so once|s.%--
me006|i i was thinking getting getting us a set of acoustic events to um to be able to distinguish between uh phones and words and stuff.|s^cc
me006|and um|fh
me006|once we|s.%--
me006|we would figure out a set of these events that can be you know um hand labeled or or derived uh from the hand labeled phone targets.|s
me006|um we could take these events and um do some cheating experiments.|fh|s^cs
me006|um where we feed um these events into an s r i system um uh and evaluate its performance on a switchboard task.|fh|s^e
me026|hey barry?|qy^d^rt
me006|uh yeah.|s^bk
me026|can you give an example of an event?|qy
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me006|sure.|s^aa
me006|um i i can give you an example of twenty odd events.|fh|s
me006|um|fh
me006|so in this paper um it's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events.|s
me006|so things like frication or uh nasality.|s^e^rt
me013|whose paper is it?|qw^rt
me006|um|h
me006|this is a paper by hubener and cardson benson berndsen.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me013|huh.|b
me013|from uh university of hamburg and bielefeld.|s^bu
me006|uhhuh.|s^aa
me013|okay.|s^bk
me006|um|fg
me018|yeah i think the|fg|s.%--
me018|just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me018|there's um in my mind anyways there's a difference between um acoustic features and acoustic events.|s
me018|and i think of acoustic features as being um things that linguists talk about.|s^e
me018|like um|s^e.%--
me013|so stuff that's not based on data.|s
me018|stuff that's not based on data necessarily.|s^m^na
me013|yeah.|s^bk
me013|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|right.|s^aa
me013|yeah.|b
me013|yeah.|b
me018|that's not based on you know acoustic data.|s^na
me013|okay.|b
me018|so they talk about features for phones.|s^e
me018|like uh its height.|s^e
me018|its tenseness.|s^e
me006|yeah.|b
me018|laxness.|s^e
me018|things like that.|s^e
me006|uhhuh.|b
me018|which may or may not be all that easy to measure in the acoustic signal.|s^e
me018|versus an acoustic event which is just something in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure.|s
me018|um so it's um it's a little different.|fh|s
me018|in at least in my mind.|s^df
me013|i mean when we did the spam work i mean there we had we had this notion of an uh auditory auditory event.|s
me006|good that's great.|s^ba
me013|and uh|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|called them avents.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh uh uh with an a at the front.|fh|s^e
me013|uh|fh
me013|and the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere.|s
me013|so|fh
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|um a sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this.|fh|s
me013|i mean there's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are going to fire because something novel has happened.|s^df
me013|that was that was the main thing that we were focusing on there.|s
me013|but there's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that aren't just sort of rapid changes.|s
me013|but|fh
me018|it's kind of like the difference between top down and bottom up.|s
me013|yeah.|b
me018|i think of the acoustic you know phonetic features as being top down.|s^e
me018|you know you look at the phone.|s^df
me018|and you say this phone is supposed to be you know have this feature this feature and this feature.|s^df
me018|whether those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant.|s
me018|whereas an acoustic event goes the other way.|s
me018|here's the signal.|s^df
me018|here's some event.|s^df
me006|uhhuh.|b
me018|what|%--
me018|and then that you know that may map to this phone sometimes.|s
me018|and sometimes it may not.|s
me018|it just maybe depends on the context.|s^e
me018|things like that.|s^e
me018|and so it's sort of a different way of looking.|s
me013|uhhuh.|b
me013|uhhuh.|b
me006|yeah.|b
me006|so|fg
me006|yeah.|fh
me026|okay.|s^bk
me006|uhhuh.|b
me006|um|fg
me006|using these these events um you know we can we can perform these these uh cheating experiments.|s^cs
me006|see how how how good they are um in um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition.|s^cs
me006|and|fh
me006|um|fh
me006|and then from that point on i would uh design robust event detectors um in a similar um spirit that saul has done uh with his graphical models and this this probabilistic and or model that he uses.|s^cc
me006|um|fh
me006|uh try to extend it to um to account for other other phenomena like um c m r co modulation release.|s^cc
me006|and|fh
me006|um|fh
me006|and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models um in a data driven way.|s^cc
me006|uh similar to the way that uh jeff jeff uh bilmes did his work.|s^e
me006|um|fh
me006|and while i'm i'm doing these um event detectors you know i can measure my progress by comparing um the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like uh neural nets.|s^cc
me006|um|fh
me006|and|fh
me006|so|fh
me006|so once we have these these uh event detectors um we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the s r i um h m m h m m system.|s^cs
me006|and|fh
me006|um|fh
me006|and test it on on switchboard or um maybe even aurora stuff.|s^cs
me006|and|fh
me006|that's pretty much the the big picture of of um the plan.|s
me013|by the way|fg
me013|um|fh
me013|there's uh a couple people who are going to be here.|s
me013|i forget if i already told you this.|s
me013|but a couple people who are going to be here for six months.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
me013|uh|fh
me013|uh there's a professor kollmeier uh from germany.|fh|s
me013|who's uh uh quite big in the uh hearing aid signal processing area.|s^e
me013|and um michael kleinschmidt who's worked with him.|s
me013|who also looks at auditory properties inspired by various uh brain function things.|s^e
me006|huh.|b
me013|so|fh
me013|um|fh
me013|um i think they'll be interesting to talk to in this sort of issue.|s^cs
me013|as these detectors are are uh developing.|s^df
me006|huh.|b
me006|okay.|s^bk
me013|so he looks at interesting interesting things in in the different ways of looking at spectra in order to to get various speech properties out.|s
me013|so|fh
me006|okay.|b
me013|okay.|fg
me013|well|fh
me013|short meeting.|s^tc
me013|but that's okay.|s^bd
me013|and uh|fh
me013|we might as well do our digits.|s^co
me013|and like i say i i encourage you to go ahead and meet uh next week with uh uh hynek.|s^cs
me013|all right.|s^bk
me013|i'll i'll start.|s^cc
me013|it's uh one thirty five.|s
me013|seventeen|z
mn049|is it starting now?|z
me018|yep.|z
mn049|so what what from what|z
mn049|whatever we say from now on it can be held against us.|z
me006|hello?|z
mn049|right?|z
me018|that's right.|z
mn049|and uh|z
me006|it's your right to remain silent.|z
mn049|yeah.|z
mn049|so i the the problem is that i actually don't know how these held meetings are held.|s^rt
mn049|if they are very informal and sort of just people are say what's going on.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|and|%-
me018|yeah that's usually what we do.|s^aa
me018|we just sort of go around and people say what's going on what's the latest uh|s^df.%--:qw.%--
mn049|okay.|s^bk
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|okay.|b
mn049|so i guess that what may be a reasonable is if i uh first make a report on what's happening in aurora in general at least what from my perspective.|s^t
me018|yeah.|b
me018|that would be great.|s^ba
fn002|uh|%-
mn049|and and uh so i i think that carmen and stephane reported on uh amsterdam meeting.|fg|s^rt
mn049|which was kind of interesting.|s^ba
mn049|because it was for the first time we realized we are not friends really but we are competitors.|s^rt
mn049|because until then it was sort of like everything was like wonderful.|s
mn049|and|%-
me018|yeah.|fg
me018|it seemed like there were still some issues.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|that they were trying to decide.|s^rt
mn049|there is a plenty of there're plenty of issues.|s^na
me018|like the voice activity detector|s.%-
mn049|well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals which was french telecom alcatel and us both had uh voice activity detector.|s
me018|right.|b
mn049|and i said well a big surprise i mean we could have told you that four months ago except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up.|s:s
mn049|obviously french telecom didn't volunteer this information either.|s
me018|right.|b
mn049|because we were working on mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months.|s
mn049|because that's buying us the most uh thing.|s^df
mn049|and everybody said well but this is not fair we didn't know that.|s
mn049|and of course uh the it's not working on features really.|s
me018|right.|b
mn049|and i agreed.|s
mn049|i said well yeah.|s:s
mn049|you are absolutely right.|s^aa
mn049|i mean if i wish that you provided better end point at speech because uh|s.%--
mn049|or at least that if we could modify the recognizer uh to account for these long silences.|s^cs
mn049|because otherwise uh that that that wasn't a correct thing.|s
mn049|and so then everybody else says well we should we need to do a new evaluation without voice activity detector.|fh|s:s
mn049|or we have to do something about it.|s:s
me018|right.|b
mn049|and in principle i uh i we agreed.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|we said uh yeah.|s:s
mn049|because uh|%--
mn049|but in that case uh we would like to change the uh the algorithm.|s^cs
mn049|because uh if we are working on different data we probably will use a different set of tricks.|s^df
me018|right.|b
mn049|but unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done.|s^rt
mn049|because french telecom was saying no no no now everybody has access to our code.|s
mn049|so everybody is going to copy what we did.|s
mn049|yeah.|fh
mn049|well our argument was everybody has access to our code and everybody always had access to our code.|s
mn049|we never uh uh denied that.|s
mn049|we thought that people are honest that if you copy something and if it is protected protected by patent then you negotiate or something.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me018|right.|b
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|i mean if you find our technique useful we are very happy.|s
me018|right.|s^aa
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but and french telecom was saying no no no.|s:s
mn049|there is a lot of little tricks which uh sort of uh cannot be protected and you guys will take them which probably is also true.|s
mn049|i mean you know it might be that people will take uh uh the algorithms apart and use the blocks from that.|fh|s
mn049|but i somehow think that it wouldn't be so bad as long as people are happy uh uh uh honest about it.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|and i think they have to be honest in the long run because winning proposal again uh what will be available is will be a code.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so the uh the people can go to code and say well listen this is what you stole from me.|s
me018|right.|b
mn049|you know?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|right.|b
mn049|so let's deal with that.|s^co
mn049|so i don't see the problem.|s
mn049|the biggest problem of course is that that alcatel french telecom claims well we fulfilled the conditions.|s:s
mn049|we are the best.|s^ba
mn049|uh we are the standard.|s
mn049|and and other people don't feel that.|s^rt
mn049|because they so they now decided that that is the whole thing will be done on well endpointed data.|s
mn049|essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech.|s^rt
mn049|because most of this uh the speechdat car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uh.|s^bk
mn049|and uh we will run again.|fh|s
mn049|still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms.|s
mn049|but i assume so.|s
mn049|because uh we would fight for that really.|s
mn049|uh but since uh|fh|%--
mn049|at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum gets uh gets you twenty one percent improvement overall and twenty seven improvement on speechdat car.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|then obvious the database uh i mean the the the uh the baseline will go up.|s
me018|right.|b
mn049|and nobody can then achieve fifty percent improvement.|s
mn049|so they agreed that uh there will be a twenty five percent improvement required on on uh bad badly mismatched|s.%-
me018|but wait a minute.|s^co
me018|i thought the endpointing really only helped in the noisy cases.|s
mn049|it uh|%-
me018|oh but you still have that with the m f c c.|s^bu
me018|okay.|s^bk
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|s^bk
mn049|yeah but you have the same i mean m f c c basically has an enormous number of uh insertions.|fg|s
me018|right.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|and so so now they want to say we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition and only twenty five percent for the serial cases.|fh|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|yeah and uh and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed.|fh|s
mn049|and so last time uh during the meeting i just uh brought up the issue.|s
mn049|i said well you know uh quite frankly i'm surprised how lightly you are making these decisions.|s
mn049|because this is a major decision.|s
mn049|for two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement.|s
mn049|and suddenly you are saying oh no we we will do something less.|s
mn049|but maybe we should discuss that.|s^cs^t
mn049|and everybody said oh we discussed that and you were not a there.|s
mn049|and i said well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing things.|s:s
mn049|then they said oh no no no because uh everybody is invited.|s
mn049|however there is only ten or fifteen lines so people can't even you know participate.|s
mn049|so uh they agreed and so they said okay we will discuss that.|s
mn049|immediately nokia uh raised the question.|s
mn049|and they said oh yeah we agree this is not good to to uh dissolve the uh uh the uh the criterion.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so now officially nokia is uh uh complaining and said they they are looking for support.|s^rt
mn049|uh i think qualcomm is uh saying too we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet.|fh|s
mn049|we should at least try once again one more round.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so this is where we are.|s^t
me018|huh.|b
mn049|i hope that i hope that this is going to be adopted.|s
mn049|next wednesday we are going to have uh another uh teleconferencing call so we'll see what uh where it goes.|s
me018|so what about the issue of um the weights on the for the different systems?|qo^tc
me018|the well matched and medium mismatched and|s^e.%-
mn049|yeah.|fg
mn049|that's what that's a very good uh point.|s^ba
mn049|because david says well you know we we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so while you are right but uh you know but|s.%--
mn049|uh yeah.|fh
mn049|if you of course if you put a zero uh weight zero on a mismatched condition or highly mismatched then then you are done.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but weights were also already decided uh half a year ago.|s
me018|and they're the staying the same?|qy^d^rt
mn049|so|fh
mn049|well of course people will not like it.|h|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|now what is happening now is that i i think that people try to match the criterion to solution.|s
mn049|they have solution.|s
mn049|now they want to make sure their criterion is|s.%--
me018|right.|b
mn049|and i think that this is not the right way.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|uh it may be that that|s.%--
mn049|eventually it may may it may have to happen.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but it's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and i don't think we did.|s
mn049|basically i think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data.|s
mn049|and uh essentially there were these arbitrary decisions made and and everything.|s
mn049|so so so this is this is where it is.|s^tc
mn049|so what we are doing at o g i now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we i think a little bit neglected.|s^rt
mn049|like noise separation.|s
mn049|uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically.|fh|s
mn049|which would be a uh more robust to noise.|s
mn049|and so far not much uh success.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|we tried uh things which uh a long time ago bill byrne suggested.|s
mn049|instead of using fourier spectrum from fourier transform use the spectrum from l p c model.|s
mn049|their argument there was the l p c model fits the peaks of the spectrum so it may be naturally more robust in noise.|s
mn049|and i thought well that makes sense but so far we can't get much much out of it.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|uh we may try some standard techniques like spectral subtraction and|fh|s.%-
me018|you haven't tried that yet?|qy^d^rt
mn049|not not not much.|s^nd
me018|huh.|b
mn049|or even i was thinking about uh looking back into these totally ad hoc techniques.|s
mn049|like for instance uh dennis klatt was suggesting uh the one way to uh deal with noisy speech is to add noise to everything.|s^cs
me018|huh.|b
mn049|so i mean uh uh add moderate amount of noise to all data.|s
me018|oh!|s^fe
me018|i see.|s^bk
mn049|so that makes uh any additive noise less less effective.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|right.|s^aa
mn049|because you already uh had the noise uh in a|s.%--
mn049|and it was working at the time.|s
mn049|it was kind of like one of these things you know but|s.%--
mn049|if you think about it it's actually pretty ingenious.|s^ba
mn049|so well you know just take a take a spectrum and and and add of the constant c to every every value.|s
me018|well you're you're basically|s.%-
me018|yeah.|b
me018|so you're making all your training data more uniform.|s^bs
mn049|exactly.|s^aa
mn049|and if if then if this data becomes noisy it it becomes effectively becomes less noisy basically.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|but of course you cannot add too much noise because then you'll then you're clean recognition goes down.|s
mn049|but i mean it's yet to be seen how much.|s
mn049|it's a very simple technique.|s
me018|uhhuh.|s^no^rt
mn049|yes indeed it's a very simple technique.|s
mn049|you just take your spectrum and and use whatever is coming from f f t add constant.|s^cs
me018|huh.|b
mn049|you know?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|onto power spectrum.|s^rt
mn049|that that|%--
mn049|or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum what you can start doing you can leave start leaving out the the parts which are uh uh low in energy.|s^cs
mn049|and then perhaps uh one could try to find a a all pole model to such a spectrum.|s^cs
mn049|because a all pole model will still try to to to put the the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero.|s
mn049|so that's what we want to try.|s
mn049|i have a visitor from brno.|s
mn049|he's a kind of like young faculty.|s
mn049|pretty hard working so he so he's so he's looking into that.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|and then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this trap recognition.|s
mn049|this uh this is this recognition from temporal patterns.|s^e
me018|huh!|b
me018|what is that?|qw^rt
mn049|uh you don't know about traps!|s^fe|s
me006|huh.|b
me018|the traps sound familiar i but i don't|s.%-
mn049|yeah.|fg
mn049|i mean|%--
mn049|this is familiar like sort of because we gave you the name.|s
mn049|but what it is is that normally what you do is that you recognize uh speech based on a shortened spectrum.|fh|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn049|essentially l l p c mel cepstrum uh everything starts with a spectral slice.|s
mn049|uh so if you so given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding sliding the spectrogram along the uh frequency axis.|fh|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and you keep shifting this thing and you have a spectrogram.|s^e
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so you can say well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and what you get is then that you get a vector.|s
mn049|and this vector can be a a assigned to some phoneme.|s
mn049|namely you can say it i will i will say that this vector will uh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector.|s
mn049|and you can try to classify based on that.|s
me018|huh.|s^bk
mn049|and you so you|%--
mn049|so it's a very different vector very different properties.|s^rt
mn049|we don't know much about it.|s^rt
me018|huh.|b
mn049|but the truth is|%-
me018|but you have many of those vectors per phoneme.|s^ng
mn049|well so you get many decisions.|s
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|uhhuh.|s^bk
mn049|and then you can start thinking about how to combine these decisions.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|exactly that's what yeah that's what it is.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|because if you run this uh recognition you get you still get about twenty percent error.|s
mn049|uh twenty percent correct.|s^bsc
me018|huh.|b
mn049|you know?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|on on like for the frame by frame basis.|s
mn049|so uh uh so it's much better than chance.|s
me018|how wide are the uh frequency bands?|qw
mn049|that's another thing.|s
mn049|well currently we start i mean we start always with critical band spectrum.|s
mn049|for various reasons.|s^df
mn049|but uh the latest uh observation uh is that you you you are you can get quite a big advantage of using two critical bands at the same time.|s^rt
me006|are they adjacent?|qy^rt
me006|or are they|qrr.%-
mn049|adjacent adjacent.|s^aa^m
me006|okay.|s^bk
mn049|and the reasons there are some reasons for that.|s
mn049|because there are some reasons i can i could talk about will have to tell you about things like masking experiments which uh uh uh uh yield critical bands.|s^rt
mn049|and also experiments with release of masking which actually tell you that something is happening across critical bands across bands.|s
mn049|and|%-
me018|well how do you how do you uh convert this uh energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers?|qw
mn049|it's uh uh uh i mean time t zero is one number time|s.%-
me018|yeah but what's the number?|qw
me018|is it just the|qy.%-
mn049|it's a spectral energy logarithmic spectral energy.|s
me018|it's just the amount of energy in that band from in that time interval.|s^bu
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|yes yes.|s^aa
mn049|yes yes.|s^aa
me018|okay.|s^bk
mn049|and that's what that's what i'm saying then.|fg|s
mn049|so this is a this is a starting vector.|s.x
mn049|it's just like shortened spectrum or something.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but now we are trying to understand what this vector actually represents.|s^rt
mn049|for instance a question is like how correlated are the elements of this vector.|s:qw
mn049|turns out they are quite correlated because i mean especially the neighboring ones.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|they they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so there's a very high correlation.|s^bs
mn049|so the classifiers which use the diagonal covariance matrix don't like it.|s
mn049|so we're thinking about de correlating them.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|then the question is uh can you describe elements of this vector by gaussian distributions or to what extent.|s:qw
mn049|because uh|%-
mn049|and and and so on and so on.|s
mn049|so we are learning quite a lot about that.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|and then another issue is how many vectors we should be using.|s
mn049|i mean the so the minimum is one.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but i mean is the is the critical band the right uh uh dimension?|qy^rt
mn049|so we somehow made arbitrary decision yes.|s
mn049|then but then now we are thinking a lot how to uh how to use at least the neighboring band because that seems to be happening.|fh|s
mn049|this i somehow start to believe that's what's happening in recognition.|s
mn049|because a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands.|s^df^rt
mn049|but then oh uh uh|%--
mn049|so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal uh uh independently in individual critical bands.|s
mn049|that's what masking experiments tell you.|s
mn049|but at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands.|s^rt
mn049|when you are making any decisions you compare what's happening in in this band to what's happening to the band to to to the to the neighboring bands.|s
mn049|and that's how you make uh decisions.|s^bs
mn049|that's why the articulatory events which uh fletcher talks about they are about two critical bands.|s
mn049|you need at least two basically.|s
mn049|you need some relative relative relation.|s
me006|huh.|b
me018|huh.|b
mn049|absolute number doesn't tell you the right thing.|s
mn049|you need to you need to compare it to something else what's happening.|s
mn049|but it's what's happening in the in the close neighborhood.|s
mn049|so if you are making decision what's happening at one kilohertz you want to know what's happening at nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred hertz.|s
mn049|but you don't much care what's happening at three kilohertz.|s
me018|so it's really|s^bu.%--
me018|it's sort of like saying that what's happening at one kilohertz depends on what's happening around it.|s^bu
me018|it's sort of relative to it.|s
mn049|to some extent it that is also true.|s^aap
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|yeah.|fg
mn049|but it's but for but for instance uh uh what what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands recognition can discard it.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|is what's happening?|qw
mn049|hey!|s^fe
me006|hey!|s^fe
mn049|okay we need us another another voice here.|s
me018|hey stephane.|s
mn049|yeah?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|i think so.|s
me018|yep.|s^aa
mn049|yeah?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|sure.|s^aa
me018|go ahead.|s^co
mn049|and so so so for instance if you if you if you add the noise that normally masks masks the uh the the signal.|fg|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band that doesn't affect the the decisions you're making about a signal within a critical band.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|unless this noise is modulated.|s^e
mn049|if the noise is modulated with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band the amount of masking is less.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|the moment you moment you provide the noise in neighboring critical bands.|s
mn049|so the masking curve normally it looks like sort of|s.%--
mn049|i start from from here.|s
mn049|so you you have uh no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band so the amount of maching is increasing.|s
mn049|and when you hit a certain point which is a critical band then the amount of masking is the same.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|so that's the famous experiment of fletcher a long time ago.|s^bs
mn049|like that's where people started thinking wow this is interesting.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|so|fh
mn049|but if you if you if you modulate the noise the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band the masking goes down.|s
mn049|so essentially essentially that's a very clear indication that that that cognition can take uh uh into consideration what's happening in the neighboring bands.|s
mn049|but if you go too far in a in a if you if the noise is very broad you are not increasing much more.|s
mn049|so so if you if you are far away from the signal uh from the signal uh the frequency at which the signal is then the even the when the noise is co modulated it it's not helping you much.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so|fh
me006|huh.|b
mn049|so things like this we are kind of playing with with with the hope that perhaps we could eventually use this in a in a real recognizer.|s
me006|uhhuh.|b
mn049|like uh partially of course we promised to do this under the the the aurora uh program.|s
me018|but you probably won't have anything before the next time we have to evaluate.|s
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|probably not.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|s^bk
mn049|well maybe most likely we will not have anything which would comply with the rules.|s
me018|uh.|s^bk
mn049|like because uh uh|%-
me018|latency and things.|s^2
mn049|latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency amount of processing.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|because uh we don't know any better yet than to use the neural net classifiers uh and uh and uh traps.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me006|uhhuh.|b
mn049|though the the work which uh everybody is looking at now aims at trying to find out what to do with these vectors so that a simple gaussian classifier would be happier with it.|s
mn007|huh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|or to what extent a gaussian classifier should be unhappy uh|s.%--
mn049|that and how to gaussian ize the vectors.|s
mn049|and|%--
me018|huh.|b
mn049|so this is uh what's happening.|s^tc
mn049|then sunil is uh uh uh asked me for one month's vacation.|s
mn049|and since he did not take any vacation for two years i had no i didn't have a heart to tell him no.|s
mn049|so he's in india.|s
me018|wow!|s^fe
mn049|and uh|%-
me018|is he getting married or something?|qy^rt
mn049|uh well uh he may be looking for a girl for for i don't i don't i don't ask.|s^j^ng
mn049|i know that when last time narayanan did that he came back engaged.|s^j^rt
me018|right.|b
me018|well i mean i've known other friends who they they go to they go back home to india for a month they come back married.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|i know.|b
mn049|i know i know.|s^aa
me018|you know huh?|qy^d^g
mn049|and then of course then what happened with narayanan was that he start pushing me that he needs to get a p h d because they wouldn't give him his wife.|s
mn049|and she's very pretty and he loves her.|s
mn049|and so so we had to really|s.%-
me018|so he finally had some incentive to finish.|s^j
mn049|oh yeah.|s^aa
me018|huh?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|we had well i had a incentive because he he always had this plan except he never told me.|s
me018|oh.|s^bk
mn049|sort of figured that that was a uh that he uh he told me the day when we did very well at our nist evaluations of speaker recognition the technology and he was involved there.|s
mn049|we were after presentation we were driving home and he told me.|s
me018|when he knew you were happy.|s^j
me018|huh?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|so i i said well yeah okay so he took another another three quarter of the year but uh he was out.|s
mn049|so i wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that though though uh pratibha still needs to get out first.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|because pratibha is there a a year earlier.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|and and satya needs to get out very first because he's he already has uh four years served.|s
mn049|though one year he was getting masters.|s^e
mn049|so|fh
mn049|so|fh
mn007|huh.|b
me018|so have the um|qy.%--
me018|when is the next uh evaluation?|qw^rt
me018|june or something?|qr^d^rt
mn049|which?|qw^bu^rt
mn049|speaker recognition?|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|no for uh aurora.|s^ar^rt
mn049|uh there we don't know about evaluation.|h|s
mn049|next meeting is in june.|s^no
me018|huh.|s^bk
mn049|and uh uh but like getting get together.|s
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
me018|are people supposed to rerun their systems?|qy^rt
mn049|nobody said that yet.|s^no
me018|or|qrr.%-
mn049|i assume so.|s^aa
me018|huh.|b
mn049|uh yes uh but nobody even set up yet the date for uh delivering uh endpointed data.|s
me018|wow.|s^bk
mn049|and this uh that that sort of stuff.|s
mn049|but i uh|%--
mn049|yeah.|fh
mn049|what i think would be of course extremely useful if we can come to our next meeting and say well you know we did get fifty percent improvement.|s^cs:s
mn049|if if you are interested we eventually can tell you how but uh we can get fifty percent improvement.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|because people will will be saying it's impossible.|s
me018|huh.|b
me018|do you know what the new baseline is?|qy^rt
me018|oh i guess if you don't have|s.%-
mn049|twenty two twenty twenty two percent better than the old baseline.|s^na^rt
me018|using your uh voice activity detector?|qy^bu^d^rt
mn049|yes.|s^aa
mn049|yes.|s^aa
mn049|but i assume that it will be similar i don't i i don't see the reason why it shouldn't be.|s
me018|similar yeah.|s^aa^m
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|i i don't see reason why it should be worse.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|because if it is worse then we will raise the objection.|s
mn049|we say well you know how come.|s:qw
mn049|because uh if we just use our voice activity detector which we don't claim even that it's wonderful it's just like one of them.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|we get this sort of improvement.|s
mn049|how come that we don't see it on on on on your endpointed data?|qw
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|i guess it could be even better.|s
mn007|because the voice activity detector that i choosed is something that cheating it's using the alignment of the speech recognition system.|s^df
mn049|i think so.|s^aa
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah uh|%-
mn007|and only the alignment on the clean channel and then mapped this alignment to the noisy channel.|s^e
mn049|and on clean speech data.|s^2
me018|oh okay.|s^bk
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|well david told me|fg|s.%-
mn049|david told me yesterday or harry actually he told harry from qualcomm.|s
mn049|and harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent.|s
mn049|he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent uh comparing to to endpointed baselines.|s:qy
mn007|yeah.|b
mn049|so they must have run already something.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|so|fh
mn049|and harry said yeah.|s
mn049|but i mean we think that we we didn't say the last word yet that we have other other things which we can try.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|so so there's a lot of discussion now about this uh new criterion.|fh|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|because nokia was objecting with uh qualcomm's we basically supported that we said yes.|s^df
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|now everybody else is saying well you guys might must be out of your mind.|s.x
mn049|uh the guenter hirsch who doesn't speak for ericsson anymore because he is not with ericsson.|s
mn049|and ericsson may not may withdraw from the whole aurora activity because they have so many troubles now.|s
me018|wow!|s^fe
mn049|ericsson's laying off twenty percent of people.|s
me006|wow!|s^fe
me018|where's uh guenter going?|qw
mn049|well guenter is already he got the job uh already was working on it for past two years or three years.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|he got a job uh at some some fachschule the technical college not too far from aachen.|s
me018|huh!|s^fe
mn049|so it's like professor university professor.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|you know not quite a university not quite a sort of it's not aachen university but it's a good school and he he's happy.|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|huh!|b
mn049|and he well he was hoping to work uh with ericsson like on uh like consulting basis.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but right now he says says it doesn't look like that anybody is even thinking about speech recognition.|s
me018|wow!|s^fe
mn049|they think about survival.|s^df
mn049|yeah.|fh
me018|huh.|b
mn049|so|fh
mn049|so but this is being now discussed right now.|s
mn049|and it's possible that uh that that it may get through that we will still stick to fifty percent.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but that means that nobody will probably get this this improvement.|s
mn049|yet with the current system.|s
mn049|which essentially i think that we should be happy with.|s
mn049|because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and|%--
mn007|but maybe i i mean we are not too far from from fifty percent from the new baseline.|s
mn049|uh but not|s^ar.%-
mn007|which would mean like sixty percent over the current baseline which is|s.%-
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|yes yes.|s^aa
mn049|we we getting we getting there right.|s^aa
mn007|well.|fg
mn007|we are around fifty fifty five.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|so|fh
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|is it like sort of is|qy.%--
mn049|how did you come up with this number?|qw^rt
mn049|if you improve twenty by twenty percent the the the all baselines it's just a quick computation?|qy^d^rt
mn007|yeah.|h
mn007|i don't know exactly if it's|s^no.%-
mn049|uhhuh.|b
mn049|i think it's about right.|s
mn007|yeah because it it depends on the weightings.|s
mn007|and|%--
mn049|yeah yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|fh
mn007|but|fh
mn007|uhhuh.|fh
me018|huh.|b
me018|how's your documentation or whatever|qw.%--
me018|it what was it you guys were working on last week?|qw
mn007|yeah.|h
mn007|finally we we've not finished with this.|s^rt
mn007|we stopped.|s
fn002|more or less it's finished.|s^ar
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
fn002|to need a little more time to improve the english and maybe to fill in something some small detail something like that.|s^cs
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|huh.|b
fn002|but it's more or less ready.|s^bs
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|well we have a document that explain a big part of the experiments.|s
fn002|necessary to to include the the bibliography.|s^2
mn007|but|%--
fn002|uhhuh.|b
mn007|it's not yeah finished yet.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|so have you been running some new experiments?|qw^rt
me018|i i thought i saw some jobs of yours running on some of the machine.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|right.|s^aa
mn007|we've done some strange things like removing c zero or c one from the the vector of parameters.|s^rt
mn007|and we noticed that c one is almost not useful at all.|s
mn007|you can remove it from the vector it doesn't hurt.|s^rt
me018|really?|qh
me018|that has no effect?|qy^d^rt
mn007|um|h
me018|uh is this in the baseline?|qy^rt
me018|or in uh|qrr.%--
mn007|in the|s^m.%--
mn007|no.|s^ar
mn007|in the proposal.|s^rt
me018|in|s^m.%--
me018|uh huh uh huh.|s^bk
mn049|so we were just discussing since you mentioned that in it|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|driving in the car with morgan this morning we were discussing a good experiment for for beginning graduate student who wants to run a lot of who wants to get a lot of numbers on something.|s^rt
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|which is like imagine that you will you will start putting every any coefficient which you are using in your vector in some general power.|s^cs
me018|in some what?|qw^rt
mn049|general power.|s
mn049|like sort of you take a power of two or take a square root or something.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so suppose that you are working with a c c one.|s^cs
mn049|so if you put it in a square root that effectively makes your model half as efficient.|s^cs
mn049|because uh your uh gaussian mixture model.|s^df
mn049|right?|qy^d^rt
mn049|computes the mean.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and and uh|%--
mn049|but it's the mean is an exponent of the whatever the the this gaussian function.|s
me018|you're compressing the range.|s
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|of that|%-
mn049|so you're compressing the range of this coefficient so it's becoming less efficient.|s^na
mn049|right?|qy^d^f^rt
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn049|so|fh
mn049|so|fh
mn049|morgan was and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor.|s
mn049|you know?|qy^d^f
mn049|uh in the|%-
me018|oh.|s^bk
mn049|you know just compress the whole vector.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|and i said well in that case why don't we just start compressing individual elements like when when|s.%--
mn049|because in old days we were doing when when people still were doing template matching and euclidean distances we were doing this liftering of parameters.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa^rt
mn049|because we observed that uh higher parameters were more important than lower for recognition.|s
mn049|and basically the the c c one contributes mainly slope.|s
me018|right.|b
mn049|and it's highly affected by uh frequency response of the of the recording equipment and that sort of thing.|s^e
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so|fh
mn049|so we were coming with all these various lifters.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|uh bell labs had he this uh uh raised cosine lifter which still i think is built into h h t k for reasons unknown to anybody.|s
mn049|but but uh we had exponential lifter or triangle lifter basic number of lifters.|fh|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|and but so they may be a way to to fiddle with the with the|fh|s.%-
me018|insertions?|qy^2^d^rt
mn049|insertions deletions or the the giving a relative uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters.|s^aap^m
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|the only of course problem is that there's an infinite number of combinations.|s
me018|oh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and if the if you if|%-
me018|you need like a some kind of a|s^cs.%-
mn049|yeah you need a lot of graduate students and a lot of computing power.|s^cs
me018|you need to have a genetic algorithm that basically tries random permutations of these things.|s^cs
mn049|i know.|b
mn049|exactly.|s^aa
mn049|oh.|fg
mn049|if you were at bell labs or i|s.%--
mn049|i shouldn't be saying this in on on a mike.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|or uh i b m.|s
mn049|that's what maybe that's what somebody would be doing.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me006|huh.|b
mn049|oh i mean i mean the places which have a lot of computing power.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so because it is really it's a it's a it's it will be a reasonable search.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|uh|fh
mn049|but i wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants.|s
me018|you know actually i don't know that this wouldn't be all that bad.|s^ba
me018|i mean you you compute the features once.|s
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
me018|and then these exponents are just applied to that.|s
mn049|absolutely.|s^aa
mn049|and everything is fixed.|s
me018|so|fg
mn049|everything is fixed.|s^r
me018|and is this something that you would adjust for training?|qy^rt
mn049|each each|%-
me018|or only recognition?|qrr
mn049|for both you would have to do.|s
me018|you would do it on both.|s^bu^m
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
me018|so you'd actually|s.%-
mn049|you have to do both.|s^r
mn049|because essentially you are saying uh this feature is not important.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|or less important.|s
mn049|so that's a that's a painful one.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|so for each uh set of exponents that you would try it would require a training and a recognition.|s^bu
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|but but wait a minute.|s^co
mn049|you may not need to uh uh retrain the model.|s
mn049|you just may may need to uh give uh less weight to to uh a uh a component of the model which represents this particular feature.|s^cs
mn049|you don't have to retrain it.|s
me018|oh.|s^bk
me018|so if you|%--
me018|instead of altering the feature vectors themselves you you modify the the the gaussians in the models.|s^bu
mn049|you just multiply.|s^2
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yep.|b
mn049|you modify the gaussian in the model.|s^m^na
mn049|but in the in the test data you would have to put it in the power.|s^e
mn049|but in a training what you in a training uh in trained model all you would have to do is to multiply a model by appropriate constant.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|but why if you're if you're if you're altering the model why in the test data why would you have to muck with the uh cepstral coefficients?|qw
mn049|because in uh test in uh test data you don't have a model.|s
mn049|you have uh only data.|s^e
mn049|but in a in a|%-
me018|no but you're running your data through that same model.|s^nd
mn049|that is true.|s^aa
mn049|but i mean so what you want to do you want to say if uh you if you observe something like stephane observes that c one is not important you can do two things.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|if you have a trained trained recognizer in the model you know the the the the component which i i mean dimension|s.%-
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|all of the all of the mean and variances that correspond to c one you put them to zero.|s
mn049|to the you you know it.|s^na
me018|yeah.|s^bk
mn049|but what i'm proposing now if it is important but not as important you multiply it by point one in a model.|s^cs
mn049|but but but|%-
me018|but what are you multiplying?|qy
me018|because those are means.|s
me018|right?|qy^d^rt
me018|i mean you're|%-
me006|you're multiplying the standard deviation?|qy^d^rt
me006|so it's|%-
mn049|i think that you multiply the|s^cs.%-
mn049|i would i would have to look in the in the math.|s
mn049|i mean how how does the model uh|qw.%-
me018|i think you|%-
me018|yeah i think you'd have to modify the standard deviation or something so that you make it wider or narrower.|s^cs
mn049|yeah.|b
me006|because|%-
mn049|yeah.|b
me006|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
mn049|effectively that's that that's uh i|%-
mn049|exactly.|s^aa
mn049|that's what you do.|s
mn049|that's what you do you you you modify the standard deviation as it was trained.|s^r
me006|yeah.|b
mn049|effectively you you know in in front of the of the model you put a constant.|s
mn049|yeah effectively what you're doing is you is you are modifying the the the deviation.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|oop.|b
me006|the spread.|s
me018|sorry.|s^fa
me006|right?|qy^d^g
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|the spread.|s^aa^m
me018|so|fg
me006|it's the same same mean.|s
mn049|and and and|fg
me006|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|so by making the standard deviation narrower uh your scores get worse for|s^bu.%--
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
me018|unless it's exactly right on the mean.|s^bu
mn049|your|%-
mn049|no.|s^ar
mn049|by making it narrower|s.%-
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|i mean there's you're you're allowing for less variance.|s
mn049|uh your|%-
me006|uhhuh.|b
mn049|yes.|s^aa
mn049|so you making this particular dimension less important.|s^bs
mn049|because see what you are fitting is the multidimensional gaussian.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^f^rt
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn049|it's a it has it has uh thirty nine dimensions or thirteen dimensions if you ignore deltas and double deltas.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so in order if you in order to make dimension which which stephane sees uh less important uh uh i mean not not useful less important what you do is that this particular component in the model you can multiply by you can you can basically de weight it in the model.|s^cs
mn049|but you can't do it in a in a test data.|s
mn049|because you don't have a model for i mean uh when the test comes.|s^df
mn049|but what you can do is that you put this particular component in and and you compress it.|s^cs
mn049|that becomes uh gets less variance subsequently becomes less important.|s
me018|couldn't you just do that to the test data and not do anything with your training data?|qy^rt
mn049|that would be very bad.|s^ba
mn049|because uh your your model was trained uh expecting uh|s^df.%--
mn049|that wouldn't work.|s
mn049|because your model was trained expecting a certain variance on c one.|s^df
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and because the model thinks c one is important.|s
mn049|after you train the model you sort of you could do you could do still what i was proposing initially.|s^cs
mn049|that during the training you you compress c one that becomes then it becomes less important in a training.|s^cs
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but if you have if you want to run extensive experiment without retraining the model you don't have to retrain the model.|s
mn049|you train it on the original vector.|s
mn049|but after you when you are doing this parametric study of importance of c one you will de weight the c one component in the model.|s^rt
mn049|and you will put in the you will compress the this component in a in the test data by the same amount.|s
me018|could you also if you wanted to|qy.%--
me018|if you wanted to try an experiment uh by leaving out say c one couldn't you in your test data uh modify the all of the c one values to be um way outside of the normal range of the gaussian for c one that was trained in the model?|qy^rt
me018|so that effectively the c one never really contributes to the score?|qy^d^rt
mn007|uhhuh.|b.%
me018|do you know what i'm|qy.%-
mn049|no.|s^ar
mn049|that would be a severe mismatch.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|what you are proposing?|qy^d^rt
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|no you don't want that.|s^ar
mn049|because that would then your model would be unlikely.|s^df
mn049|your likelihood would be low.|s^e
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|uhhuh.|s^aa
mn049|because you would be providing severe mismatch.|s
me018|but what if you set if to the mean of the model then?|qw
me018|and it was a you set all c ones coming in through your test data you you change whatever value that was there to the mean that your model had.|s
mn049|no that would be very good match.|s^ba
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|that you would|%-
mn007|which|%-
mn007|well yeah but we have several means.|s^aap
mn007|so|fh
mn049|i see what you are saying.|s^bk
mn007|right?|%
me006|saying.|s^2
mn049|but|fh
mn049|uh no no i don't think that it would be the same.|fh|s^ar
mn049|let me uh|%--
mn049|if you set it to a mean that would|s^cs.%--
mn049|no you can't do that.|s^ar^co
me018|oh that's true.|s^aa
mn049|you you chuck you can't do that.|s^ar^co
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|yeah because you you have|s.%-
mn007|wait.|s^co.%
mn007|which|%-
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|because that would be a really fiddling with the data.|s^df
mn049|you can't do that.|s^co
me018|huh huh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|but what you can do i'm confident you|s^cs.%--
mn049|well i'm reasonably confident and i putting it on the record.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^f^rt
mn049|i mean people will listen to it for for centuries now.|s^j
mn049|is what you can do is you train the model uh with the with the original data.|s^cs
me006|uhhuh.|b
mn049|then you decide that you want to see how important c c one is.|s
mn049|so what you will do is that a component in the model for c one you will divide it by by two.|s
mn049|and you will compress your test data by square root.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|then you will still have a perfect match.|s
mn049|except that this component of c one will be half as important in a in a overall score.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b^rt
mn049|then you divide it by four and you take a square fourth root.|s
mn049|then if you think that some component is more is more important then it then then uh uh it is based on training then you uh multiply this particular component in the model by by by|s.%-
me018|you're talking about the standard deviation?|qy^d^rt
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah multiply this component uh it by number larger than one.|s^aa|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and you put your data in power higher than one.|s
mn049|then it becomes more important in the overall score i believe.|s
me018|but don't you have to do something to the mean also?|qy^rt
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|but at the|%-
mn049|no.|s^ar
mn007|no.|s^ar
mn049|no.|s^ar
me006|yeah.|b
mn007|but i think it's uh the the variance is on on the denominator in the in the gaussian equation.|s
mn007|so i think it's maybe it's the contrary.|s
mn007|if you want to decrease the importance of a parameter you have to increase it's variance.|s.x
mn049|yes.|s^aa
mn049|right.|s^aa.x
mn049|yes.|s^aa
fn002|multiply.|s.x
mn049|exactly.|s^aa
mn049|yeah.|fg
mn049|so you so so you may want to do it other way around.|s^cs
mn007|huh.|b
mn007|that's right.|s^aa
mn007|okay.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me006|right.|b
me018|but if your|%--
me018|if your um original data for c one had a mean of two.|s
mn049|uhhuh.|b^rt
me018|and now you're you're you're changing that by squaring it.|s
me018|now your mean of your c one original data has is four.|s
me018|but your model still has a mean of two.|s
me018|so even though you've expended the range your mean doesn't match anymore.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|do you see what i mean?|qy^rt
mn049|let's see.|s^co
mn007|i think what i see what could be done is you don't change your features which are computed once for all.|s^cs^rt
mn049|uhhuh.|b
mn007|but you just tune the model.|s
mn007|so you have your features.|s^rt
mn007|you train your your model on these features.|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn007|and then if you want to decrease the importance of c one you just take the variance of the c one component in the in the model and increase it if you want to decrease the importance of c one or decrease it|s.%--
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|right.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|you would have to modify the mean in the model.|s
mn049|i you i agree with you.|s^aa
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|yeah so|fg
mn049|but i mean but it's it's it's do able.|s
mn007|well.|fg
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|i mean it's predictable.|s
mn049|uh yeah.|b
me018|it's predictable yeah.|s^aa^m
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah it's predictable.|s^aa^r
me018|yeah.|b
mn007|huh.|b
me018|but as a simple thing you could just just muck with the variance.|s^cs
mn007|just adjust the model.|s^2
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|to get uh this uh this the effect i think that you're talking about.|s^df
mn049|uhhuh.|b
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|it might be.|s^am
me018|could increase the variance to decrease the importance.|s
mn049|uhhuh.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah because if you had a huge variance you're dividing by a large number you get a very small contribution.|fg|s
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|it becomes more flat.|s
me006|doesn't matter|%-
mn007|and|%-
me006|right.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|huh.|b
me006|yeah the sharper the variance the more more important to get that one right.|s
mn049|uhhuh.|b
me018|yeah you know actually this reminds me of something that happened uh when i was at b b n.|fg|s
me018|we were playing with putting um pitch into the mandarin recognizer.|s
mn049|uhhuh.|b
me018|and this particular pitch algorithm um when it didn't think there was any voicing was spitting out zeros.|s
me018|so we were getting uh when we did clustering we were getting groups uh of features|s.%-
mn049|pretty new outliers interesting outliers.|s
me018|yeah with with a mean of zero and basically zero variance.|fg|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|variance.|s^m
me018|so when when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it we got a great score.|fh|s
me018|i mean it was just you know incredibly high score and so that was throwing everything off.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|so if you have very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches.|fh|s
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|so so that's a way yeah yeah|fh|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|that's a way to increase the yeah|s.%--
me018|yeah that's interesting.|s^ba
me018|so in fact that would be|s.%--
me018|that doesn't require any retraining.|s^bu
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|no.|s^aa
mn049|no no.|s^aa^m
mn007|that's right.|s^aa
me018|so it's just|s.%-
mn007|so that means|s.%-
mn007|tuning the models and testing actually.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|it's just recognitions.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|you you have a step where you you modify the models make a copy of your models with whatever variance modifications you make and rerun recognition.|s
mn007|it would be quick.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|and then do a whole bunch of those.|s^rt
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|that could be set up fairly easily i think.|s
me018|and you have a whole bunch of|s.%--
me018|you know|fh
mn049|chuck is getting himself in trouble.|s^j
me018|that's an interesting idea actually.|s^ba
me018|for testing the|%--
me018|yeah.|fh
me018|huh!|fh
me006|didn't you say you got these uh h t k's set up on the new linux boxes?|qy^rt
me018|that's right.|s^aa
me018|in fact and and they're just right now they're installing uh increasing the memory on that uh the linux box.|s
me006|yeah.|b
mn049|hey!|s^fe
mn049|and chuck is sort of really fishing for how to keep his computer busy.|s^j
me006|right.|b
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|absinthe.|s
me018|absinthe.|s
mn049|well you know that's|s.%-
me018|we've got five processors on that.|s
mn049|that's yeah that's a good thing.|s^ba
me006|oh yeah.|s^bk
me018|and two gigs of memory.|s^e
me006|that's right.|s^aa
mn049|because then you just write the do and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of you you can go fishing.|s^j
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|exactly.|s^aa
me006|pretend yeah.|s^aa
me018|yeah.|b
fn002|go fishing.|s
me018|see how many cycles we used?|qy^d^rt
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|then you are sort of in this mode like all of those arpa people are.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|uh since it is on the record i can't say uh which company it was.|s
mn049|but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company.|s
mn049|and during a during a discussion there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns uh on a computer.|s^j
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so after two hours uh the visitor said why are you hitting this carriage return.|s^j:qw
mn049|and he said well you know we are being paid by a computer i mean we are we have a government contract.|s^j
mn049|and they pay us by by amount of computer time we use.|s^j
mn049|it was in old days when there were uh of p d p eights and that sort of thing.|s^j
me018|oh my gosh!|s^fe
me018|so he had to make it look like|s^bu.%--
mn049|because so they had a they literally had to monitor at the time at the time on a computer how much time is being spent i or on on this particular project.|s
me018|yeah.|b
me018|how|s^m.%-
me018|idle time.|s^2
me018|yeah.|b
me006|yeah.|b
mn049|nobody was looking even at what was coming out.|s
me018|have you ever seen those little|qy.%--
me018|um|h
me018|it's it's this thing that's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water.|s^rt
mn049|yeah i know.|s^aa
mn049|right.|b
me018|so if you could hook that up so it hit the keyboard|s^j.%--
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|that's an interesting experiment.|s^ba
mn049|it would be similar similar to|s.%-
mn049|i knew some people who were uh that was in old communist uh czechoslovakia.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^f^rt
mn049|so we were watching for american airplanes coming to spy on on uh on us at the time.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|so there were three guys uh uh stationed in the middle of the woods on one lonely uh watching tower pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^f^rt
me018|ugh!|b
mn049|and so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village.|s
mn049|and|fh
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|and so but they there was one plane flying over always uh uh above.|fh|s
mn049|and so that was the only work which they had.|s
mn049|they like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from prague to brno basically flying there.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|so they very first thing was that they would always run back and and at four o'clock and and quickly make a call this plane is uh uh passing.|s
mn049|then a second thing was that they they took the line from this post to uh uh a local pub.|s
mn049|and they were calling from the pub.|s
mn049|and they but third thing which they made when they screwed up they finally they had to the the the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore.|s
mn049|and one day there was there was no plane.|s
mn049|at least they were sort of smart enough that they looked if the plane is flying there.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^f^rt
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|and pub owner says oh my four o'clock okay quickly pick up the phone call that there's a plane flying.|s
mn049|there was no plane for some reason.|s
me018|and there wasn't?|qy^d^rt
mn049|it was downed.|s
mn049|or and|fh
mn049|so they got in trouble.|s
mn049|but but uh|fh
me018|huh!|s^fe
me018|well that's that's a really|s.%-
mn049|so so yeah.|b
me018|that wouldn't be too difficult to try.|s
me018|maybe i could set that up.|s^cc
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|and we'll just|%-
mn049|well at least go test the test the uh assumption about c one i mean to begin with.|s^co
mn049|but then of course one can then think about some predictable result to change all of them.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|it's just like we used to do these uh these uh um the the uh distance measures.|s
mn049|it might be that uh|%-
me018|yeah so the first set of uh variance weighting vectors would be just you know one modifying one and leaving the others the same.|fg|s
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|maybe.|s^am
me018|and and do that for each one.|s
mn049|because you see i mean what is happening here in a in a in a in such a model is that it's tells you yeah what has a low variance uh is uh is uh is more reliable.|s
me018|that would be one set of experiment|s.%-
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|how do we|qw.%-
me018|yeah when the data matches that then you get really|s^aa.%--
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
me018|yeah.|b
me018|right.|b
mn049|how do we know especially when it comes to noise?|qw
me018|but there could just naturally be low variance.|s
mn049|yeah.|b^rt
me018|because i like i've noticed in the higher cepstral coefficients the numbers seem to get smaller.|s^df
me018|right?|qy^d^g^rt
me018|so|%--
mn007|they|%-
me018|i mean just naturally.|s
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|yeah that's|s^aa.%-
mn007|they have smaller means also.|s
me018|yeah.|s^aa
mn007|uh|h
me018|exactly.|s^aa
me018|and so it seems like they're already sort of compressed.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
me018|the range of values.|s^e
mn049|yeah that's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh euclidean distance more like uh mahalanobis distance with a diagonal co variance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|huh.|b
mn049|what they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance.|s
mn049|turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast i believe as the index of the cepstral coefficients.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|i think you can show that uh uh analytically.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|so typically what happens is that you you need to weight the uh weight the higher coefficients more than uh the lower coefficients.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|huh.|b
mn007|huh.|b
mn049|so|fh
me018|yeah|b
mn049|when yeah is|%--
mn049|when we talked about aurora still i wanted to make a plea uh encourage for uh more communication between between uh uh different uh parts of the distributed uh uh center.|s
mn049|uh even when there is absolutely nothing to to to say but the weather is good in in in berkeley.|s
mn049|i'm sure that it's being appreciated in oregon and maybe it will generate a similar responses down here.|s
mn049|like uh|%--
mn007|we can set up a webcam maybe.|s^cs
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
me006|yeah.|s^aa^j
mn049|what you know nowadays|s.%--
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|it's up actually do able almost.|s
me018|is the um|qy.%--
me018|if we mail to aurora inhouse does that go up to you guys also?|qy^rt
mn049|i don't think so.|s^ar
mn007|no.|s^ar
mn049|no.|s^ar
me018|okay.|s^bk
me018|so what is it|qw.%-
mn049|so we should do that.|s^co
me018|yeah we|s^aa^m.%--
mn049|we should definitely set up.|s^co
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me018|do we have a mailing list that includes uh the o g i people?|qy^rt
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|uh no.|h|s^ar
mn007|we don't have.|s^ar
me018|oh!|s^fe
mn049|uhhuh.|b
me018|maybe we should set that up.|s^cs
me018|that would make it much easier.|s^df
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|yeah that would make it easier.|s^aa
me018|so maybe just call it aurora or something that would|s^cs.%--
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|and then we also can send the the to the same address.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|and it goes to everybody?|qy^bu^d^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|okay.|s^bk
me018|maybe we can set that up.|s^cs
mn049|because what's happening naturally in research i know is that people essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered.|s
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|but what the the then the danger is in a group like this is that two people are working on the same thing and of course both of them come with the very good solution but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|oh there's another thing which i wanted to uh uh report.|s^t
mn049|lucash i think uh wrote the software for this aurora two system.|s
mn049|reasonably uh uh good one because he's doing it for intel.|s
mn049|but i trust that we have uh rights to uh use it uh or distribute it and everything.|s
mn049|because intel's intentions originally was to distribute it free of charge anyways.|s
me018|huh!|b
mn049|and so so uh we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use.|fh|s^cc
mn049|just uh|%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|it might be a reasonable point for perhaps uh start converging.|s
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|because morgan's point is that he is an experienced guy.|s
mn049|he says well you know it's very difficult to collaborate if you are working with supposedly the same thing in quotes except which is not is not the same.|s^rt
me018|uhhuh.|b
mn049|which which uh uh one is using that set of hurdles another one set is using another set of hurdles.|s^rt
mn049|so and and then it's difficult to compare.|fh|s
mn007|what about harry?|qo
mn007|uh we received a mail last week and you are starting to to do some experiments.|fh|s^rt
mn049|he got the he got the software.|s
mn049|yeah they sent the release.|s
mn007|and use this intel version.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|huh.|b
mn049|yeah because intel paid us uh|s.%--
mn049|should i say on a microphone?|qy^rt
mn049|uh some amount of money not much.|fh|s
mn049|not much i can say on a microphone.|s
mn049|much less then we should have gotten for this amount of work.|s
mn049|and they wanted uh to to have software so that they can also play with it which means that it has to be in a certain environment.|s
me018|huh.|b
mn049|they use actually some intel libraries but in the process lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to make sense uh of uh including icsi software uh not for training on the nets.|s
me018|huh.|b
me006|oh.|b
mn049|but i think he rewrote the the the or maybe somehow reused over the parts of the thing so that so that the whole thing including m l p trained m l p is one piece of uh software.|s
me018|uhhuh.|b
me018|wow!|s^fe
mn049|is it useful?|qy^rt
mn049|yeah.|fh.%
me006|yeah.|s^aa
me006|i mean i remember when we were trying to put together all the icsi software for the submission.|s
mn049|or|%-
mn049|that's what he was saying.|s
mn049|right.|fh
mn049|he said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when.|s
mn049|and and so that's where he started and that's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up.|s
me006|yeah.|b
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|and so i think it this is available.|s
me006|huh.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
mn049|so|fh
mn007|well the the only thing i would check is if he does he use intel math libraries.|s
mn007|because if it's the case it's maybe not so easy to use it on another architecture.|s
mn049|uh|%-
mn049|not maybe maybe not in a first maybe not in a first approximation.|s^am
mn007|uh yeah.|s^bk
mn049|because i think he started first just with a plain c c or c plus plus or something before|s.%--
mn007|uhhuh.|b
mn049|i i can check on that.|s^cc
mn049|yeah.|fh
mn007|yeah.|b
me018|okay.|b
me018|huh.|b
mn049|and uh in otherwise the intel libraries i think they are available free of freely.|s
mn049|but they may be running only on on uh on uh windows.|s
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
mn049|or on on the|%-
mn007|on intel architecture maybe.|s^2
mn049|yeah on intel architecture may not run in sun.|s^aa^m
mn007|i'm|%-
mn007|yeah.|b
mn007|yeah.|b
mn049|yeah.|b
mn049|that is that that is possible.|s
mn049|that's why intel of course is distributing it.|s
mn007|well|%-
mn049|right?|qy^d^g^rt
mn049|or that's|%--
mn007|yeah.|fg
mn007|well there are at least there are optimized version for their architecture.|s
mn049|yeah.|b
mn007|i don't know.|s^no
mn007|i never checked carefully these sorts of|s.%--
mn049|i know there was some issues that initially of course we do all the development on linux.|s
mn049|but we use we don't have we have only three uh uh uh uh suns.|s
mn049|and we have them only because they have a spert board in.|s
mn049|otherwise otherwise we almost exclusively are working with uh p c's now with intel.|s
mn049|in that way intel succeeded with us because they gave us too many good machines for very little money or nothing.|s
me018|yeah.|b
mn049|so so so we run everything on intel.|s
me018|wow!|s^fe
me018|huh.|b
mn049|and|%--
me018|does anybody have anything else?|qy^rt^t
me018|to|%--
me018|shall we read some digits?|qy^rt
mn007|yeah.|s^aa
mn049|yes.|s^aa
mn049|i have to take my glasses|s.%-
me018|so|fg
me018|hynek i don't know if you've ever done this.|s
me018|the way that it works is each person goes around in turn and uh you say the transcript number and then you read the digits the the strings of numbers as individual digits.|s
mn049|no.|s^aa
mn049|uhhuh.|b
me018|so you don't say eight hundred and fifty you say eight five oh and so forth.|s
mn049|okay.|s^bk
mn049|okay.|s^bk^r
me018|um|fh
mn049|so can maybe can i maybe start then?|qy^rt
me018|sure.|s^aa
